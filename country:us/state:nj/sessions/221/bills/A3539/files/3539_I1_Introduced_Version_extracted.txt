CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning certain criminal offenses involving sexual exploitation or abuse of children and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.1992, c.7 (C.2A:30B-1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     [Child] Trade in child sexual abuse or exploitation material, often referred to as child pornography, is a lucrative business which sexually exploits children and preys on their vulnerability. b.    While criminal laws exist to penalize those who sexually exploit children, these laws are sometimes insufficient to protect and indemnify the victim and prevent the perpetrators from accumulating large profits from the making and distribution of "kiddie porn." c.     This act is designed to give the victims of trade in child [pornography] sexual abuse or exploitation material a civil action against those persons who sexually abuse or exploit them for profit directly or indirectly which can be brought through a parent or guardian or child advocacy organization or by the victim upon reaching the age of majority.  Any director, officer, servant, employee or other person authorized to act on behalf of a corporation may be personally liable if found liable individually or jointly with the corporation under the provisions of this act. d.    The act will allow victims to recover three times the financial gains made by those who exploit them and will authorize injunctive relief to halt the making and distribution of films and other materials. (cf: P.L.1992, c.7, s.1) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.

Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for the offense set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (6)   For purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 18 in any photograph, film, videotape, computer program or file, video game, or any other reproduction or reconstruction shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 18.  If the child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. (7)   For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item. For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations.  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations.

If the defendant is serving a sentence of incarceration for another offense at the time [he] the defendant completes the custodial portion of the sentence imposed on the present offense, the special sentence of parole supervision for life shall not commence until the defendant is actually released from incarceration for the other offense. Persons serving a special sentence of parole supervision for life shall remain in the legal custody of the Commissioner of Corrections, shall be supervised by the Division of Parole of the State Parole Board, shall be subject to the provisions and conditions set forth in subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b) and sections 15 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59 through 30:4-123.63 and 30:4-123.65), and shall be subject to conditions appropriate to protect the public and foster rehabilitation.  Such conditions may include the requirement that the person comply with the conditions set forth in subsection f. of this section concerning use of a computer or other device with access to the Internet or the conditions set forth in subsection g. of this section concerning the operation as defined in section 1 of P.L.2017, c.315 (C.2C:40-27) of an unmanned aircraft system as defined in section 1 of P.L.2017, c.315 (C.2C:40-27). If the defendant violates a condition of a special sentence of parole supervision for life, the defendant shall be subject to the provisions of sections 16 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.63 and 30:4-123.65), and for the purpose of calculating the limitation on time served pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.65) the custodial term imposed upon the defendant related to the special sentence of parole supervision for life shall be deemed to be a term of life imprisonment. When the court suspends the imposition of sentence on a defendant who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in subsection a. of this section, the court may not suspend imposition of the special sentence of parole supervision for life, which shall commence immediately, with the Division of Parole of the State Parole Board maintaining supervision over that defendant, including the defendant's compliance with any conditions imposed by the court pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the court from at any time proceeding under the provisions of N.J.S.2C:45-1 through N.J.S.2C:45-4 against any such defendant for a violation of any conditions imposed by the court when it suspended imposition of sentence, or prevent the Division of Parole from proceeding under the provisions of sections 16 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.63 and C.30:4-123.65) against any such defendant for a violation of any conditions of the special sentence of parole supervision for life, including the conditions imposed by the court pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1. In any such proceeding by the Division of Parole, the provisions of subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b) authorizing revocation and return to prison shall be applicable to such a defendant, notwithstanding that the defendant may not have been sentenced to or served any portion of a custodial term for conviction of an offense enumerated in subsection a. of this section. c.     A person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may petition the Superior Court for release from that parole supervision. The judge may grant a petition for release from a special sentence of parole supervision for life only upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the person has not committed a crime for 15 years since the last conviction or release from incarceration, whichever is later, and that the person is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others if released from parole supervision. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.66), a person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may be released from that parole supervision term only by court order as provided in this subsection. d.    A person who violates a condition of a special sentence of community supervision for life or parole supervision for life imposed pursuant to this section without good cause is guilty of a crime of the third degree. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a person sentenced pursuant to this subsection shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the court is clearly convinced that the interests of justice so far outweigh the need to deter this conduct and the interest in public safety that a sentence to imprisonment would be a manifest injustice. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude subjecting a person who violates any condition of a special sentence of parole supervision for life to the provisions of sections 16 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.63 and C.30:4-123.65) pursuant to the provisions of subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b). e.    A person who, while serving a special sentence of parole supervision for life imposed pursuant to this section, commits a violation of N.J.S.2C:11-3, N.J.S.2C:11-4, N.J.S.2C:11-5, subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1, N.J.S.2C:13-1, section 1 of P.L.1993, c.291 (C.2C:13-6), N.J.S.2C:14-2, N.J.S.2C:14-3, N.J.S.2C:24-4, section 8 of P.L.2017, c.141 (C.2C:24-4.1), N.J.S.2C:18-2 when the offense is a crime of the second degree, or subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4 shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7, which term shall, notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:43-7 or any other law, be served in its entirety prior to the person's resumption of the term of parole supervision for life. f.    The special sentence of parole supervision for life required by this section may include any of the following Internet access conditions: (1)   Prohibit the person from accessing or using a computer or any other device with Internet capability without the prior written approval of the court except the person may use a computer or any other device with Internet capability in connection with that person's employment or search for employment with the prior approval of the person's parole officer; (2)   Require the person to submit to periodic unannounced examinations of the person's computer or any other device with Internet capability by a parole officer, law enforcement officer or assigned computer or information technology specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such information, equipment or device to conduct a more thorough inspection; (3)   Require the person to submit to the installation on the person's computer or device with Internet capability, at the person's expense, one or more hardware or software systems to monitor the Internet use; (4)   Require the person to submit to any other appropriate restrictions concerning the person's use or access of a computer or any other device with Internet capability; and (5)   Require the person to disclose all passwords used by the person to access any data, information, image, program, signal or file on the person's computer or any other device with Internet capability. g.    The special sentence of parole supervision for life required by this section may include reasonable conditions prohibiting or restricting the person's operation of an unmanned aircraft system in order to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of criminal or delinquent behavior.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.80, s.1) 12.  Section 1 of P.L.1985, c.396 (C.30:4C-26.8) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  A person, in addition to meeting other requirements as may be established by the Department of Children and Families, shall become a resource family parent or eligible to adopt a child only upon the completion of an investigation to ascertain if there is a State or federal record of criminal history for the prospective adoptive or resource family parent or any other adult residing in the prospective parent's home.  The investigation shall be conducted by the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety and shall include an examination of its own files and the obtaining of a similar examination by federal authorities. b.    If the prospective resource family parent or any adult residing in the prospective parent's home has a record of criminal history, the Department of Children and Families shall review the record with respect to the type and date of the criminal offense and make a determination as to the suitability of the person to become a resource family parent or the suitability of placing a child in that person's home, as the case may be. c.     For the purposes of this section, a conviction for one of the offenses enumerated in subsection d. or e. of this section has occurred if the person has been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state or jurisdiction for an offense that is substantially equivalent to the offenses enumerated in these subsections. d.    A person shall be disqualified from being a resource family parent or shall not be eligible to adopt a child if that person or any adult residing in that person's household ever committed a crime which resulted in a conviction for: (1)   a crime against a child, including endangering the welfare of a child and any crime involving child [pornography] sexual abuse or exploitation material pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4; or child abuse, neglect, or abandonment pursuant to R.S.9:6-3; (2)   murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3 or manslaughter pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-4; (3)   aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the second or third degree pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (4)   stalking pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); (5)   kidnapping and related offenses including criminal restraint; false imprisonment; interference with custody; criminal coercion; or enticing a child into a motor vehicle, structure, or isolated area pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1 through 2C:13-6; (6)   sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, or lewdness pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2 through N.J.S.2C:14-4; (7)   robbery which would constitute a crime of the first degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:15-1; (8)   burglary which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:18-2; (9)   domestic violence pursuant to P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.); (10) endangering the welfare of an incompetent person pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-7 or endangering the welfare of an elderly or disabled person pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-8; (11) terrorist threats pursuant to N.J.S.2C:12-3; (12) arson pursuant to N.J.S.2C:17-1, or causing or risking widespread injury or damage which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:17-2; or (13) an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense listed in paragraphs (1) through (12) of this subsection. e.     A person shall be disqualified from being a resource family parent if that person or any adult residing in that person's household was convicted of one of the following crimes and the date of release from confinement occurred during the preceding five years: (1)   simple assault pursuant to subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (2)   aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the fourth degree pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (3)   a drug-related crime pursuant to P.L.1987, c.106 (C.2C:35-1 et seq.); (4)   robbery which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:15-1; (5)   burglary which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:18-2; or (6)   an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, the "date of release from confinement" means the date of termination of court-ordered supervision through probation, parole, or residence in a correctional facility, whichever date occurs last. For purposes of this section, "resource family parent" means any person with whom a child in the care, custody, or guardianship of the Department of Children and Families is placed by the department, or with its approval, for care and shall include any person with whom a child is placed by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency for the purpose of adoption until the adoption is finalized.

(cf: P.L.2001, c.334, s.1) 17.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill updates terminology in statutory law pertaining to the sexual exploitation or abuse of children. Current state law prohibits the creation, manufacture, distribution, sale or viewing of child pornography.  Among child protection advocates, however, terms such as child sexual abuse material and child sexual exploitation material have come into wider use, replacing the general description of child pornography because these terms more accurately reflect the suffering of the children who are victims of these crimes.  When used in the context of depictions of children, the term pornography may be understood to legitimize or trivialize the sexual abuse or exploitation of those children. In addition, the term pornography carries with it the implication that the acts are performed with the consent of the child, and represent legitimate sexual material. This bill replaces the term child pornography with the term trade in child sexual abuse or exploitation material in Title 2A.  In Title 2C, the definition of item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is amended to include child sexual abuse or exploitation material and the acronym CSAEM. The bill replaces the term child pornography with network to share child sexual abuse or exploitation material in various sections of Title 2C concerning the definition, degrees of crime, examination referrals, registration of sex offenders, and special sentencing for parole supervision for life for a leader of a network distributing depictions of child sexual abuse or exploitation.        The bill further clarifies that online distribution or possession of sexual abuse or exploitation material is to be included in the schedule of penalties pertaining to offenses involving computer criminal activity in Title 2C. In Title 9, the term pornography is replaced with any crime involving child sexual abuse or exploitation material concerning disqualification of employment pursuant to N.J.S.9:3-40.5. In Title 18A, the word pornography is replaced with the term child sexual abuse or exploitation material with regard to the practice of sexting, or sending sexually explicit messages pursuant to N.J.S.18A:35-4.32. This bill replaces the term pornography in various parts of Title 30 with any crime involving child sexual abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning revocation of a day care centers registration, criteria for permanent disqualification from employment, disqualification from adopting a child or being a resource family parent, and disqualification of employment at, or ownership or sponsorship of, a child day care center. In Title 52, the term pornography is replaced with online distribution or possession of child sexual abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning the Department of Law and Public Safetys efforts to receive and respond to inquiries or complaints from members of the public reporting computer crimes pursuant to N.J.S.52:17B-193. This bill also updates the terminology used in current law to replace outdated references to certain crimes that involve the sexual exploitation or abuse of children.  According to the sponsor, the changes made in this bill are not intended, nor should they be construed, to have any substantive impact on the applicability of the affected provisions; the changes are intended to render the terminology consistent with the rest of the current statutory scheme and the broader international trend. The bill also corrects technical inconsistencies in the statutes.

(cf: P.L.1992, c.7, s.1) 2.    Section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.

Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent the court from at any time proceeding under the provisions of N.J.S.2C:45-1 through N.J.S.2C:45-4 against any such defendant for a violation of any conditions imposed by the court when it suspended imposition of sentence, or prevent the Division of Parole from proceeding under the provisions of sections 16 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.63 and C.30:4-123.65) against any such defendant for a violation of any conditions of the special sentence of parole supervision for life, including the conditions imposed by the court pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1. In any such proceeding by the Division of Parole, the provisions of subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b) authorizing revocation and return to prison shall be applicable to such a defendant, notwithstanding that the defendant may not have been sentenced to or served any portion of a custodial term for conviction of an offense enumerated in subsection a. of this section. c.     A person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may petition the Superior Court for release from that parole supervision. The judge may grant a petition for release from a special sentence of parole supervision for life only upon proof by clear and convincing evidence that the person has not committed a crime for 15 years since the last conviction or release from incarceration, whichever is later, and that the person is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others if released from parole supervision. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.66), a person sentenced to a term of parole supervision for life may be released from that parole supervision term only by court order as provided in this subsection. d.    A person who violates a condition of a special sentence of community supervision for life or parole supervision for life imposed pursuant to this section without good cause is guilty of a crime of the third degree. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a person sentenced pursuant to this subsection shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment, unless the court is clearly convinced that the interests of justice so far outweigh the need to deter this conduct and the interest in public safety that a sentence to imprisonment would be a manifest injustice. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude subjecting a person who violates any condition of a special sentence of parole supervision for life to the provisions of sections 16 through 19 and 21 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60 through 30:4-123.63 and C.30:4-123.65) pursuant to the provisions of subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.30:4-123.51b). e.    A person who, while serving a special sentence of parole supervision for life imposed pursuant to this section, commits a violation of N.J.S.2C:11-3, N.J.S.2C:11-4, N.J.S.2C:11-5, subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1, N.J.S.2C:13-1, section 1 of P.L.1993, c.291 (C.2C:13-6), N.J.S.2C:14-2, N.J.S.2C:14-3, N.J.S.2C:24-4, section 8 of P.L.2017, c.141 (C.2C:24-4.1), N.J.S.2C:18-2 when the offense is a crime of the second degree, or subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4 shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7, which term shall, notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:43-7 or any other law, be served in its entirety prior to the person's resumption of the term of parole supervision for life. f.    The special sentence of parole supervision for life required by this section may include any of the following Internet access conditions: (1)   Prohibit the person from accessing or using a computer or any other device with Internet capability without the prior written approval of the court except the person may use a computer or any other device with Internet capability in connection with that person's employment or search for employment with the prior approval of the person's parole officer; (2)   Require the person to submit to periodic unannounced examinations of the person's computer or any other device with Internet capability by a parole officer, law enforcement officer or assigned computer or information technology specialist, including the retrieval and copying of all data from the computer or device and any internal or external peripherals and removal of such information, equipment or device to conduct a more thorough inspection; (3)   Require the person to submit to the installation on the person's computer or device with Internet capability, at the person's expense, one or more hardware or software systems to monitor the Internet use; (4)   Require the person to submit to any other appropriate restrictions concerning the person's use or access of a computer or any other device with Internet capability; and (5)   Require the person to disclose all passwords used by the person to access any data, information, image, program, signal or file on the person's computer or any other device with Internet capability. g.    The special sentence of parole supervision for life required by this section may include reasonable conditions prohibiting or restricting the person's operation of an unmanned aircraft system in order to reduce the likelihood of a recurrence of criminal or delinquent behavior.

The person, if eligible, may present the expungement application after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of [his] the persons most recent conviction, payment of any court-ordered financial assessment, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later. The term "court-ordered financial assessment" as used herein and throughout this section means and includes any fine, fee, penalty, restitution, and other form of financial assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the conviction or convictions that are the subject of the application, for which payment of restitution takes precedence in accordance with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.

Notwithstanding any provision in this law or any other law to the contrary, the court shall have sole discretion to amend the judgment. Additionally, an application may be filed and presented, and the court may grant an expungement pursuant to this section, although less than five years have expired in accordance with the time requirements when the court finds: (1)   the court-ordered financial assessment is satisfied but less than five years have expired from the date of satisfaction, and the time requirement of five years is otherwise satisfied, and the court finds that the person substantially complied with any payment plan ordered pursuant to N.J.S.2C:46-1 et seq., or could not do so due to compelling circumstances affecting [his] the persons ability to satisfy the assessment; or (2)   at least four but less than five years have expired from the date of the most recent conviction, payment of any court-ordered financial assessment, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later; and the person has not been otherwise convicted of a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense since the time of the most recent conviction; and the court finds in its discretion that compelling circumstances exist to grant the expungement.

In determining whether compelling circumstances exist for the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court may consider the amount of any court-ordered financial assessment imposed, the person's age at the time of the offense or offenses, the person's financial condition and other relevant circumstances regarding the person's ability to pay. b.    Records of conviction pursuant to statutes repealed by this Code for the crimes of murder, manslaughter, treason, anarchy, kidnapping, rape, forcible sodomy, arson, perjury, false swearing, robbery, embracery, or a conspiracy or any attempt to commit any of the foregoing, or aiding, assisting or concealing persons accused of the foregoing crimes, shall not be expunged.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.80, s.1) 12.  Section 1 of P.L.1985, c.396 (C.30:4C-26.8) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  A person, in addition to meeting other requirements as may be established by the Department of Children and Families, shall become a resource family parent or eligible to adopt a child only upon the completion of an investigation to ascertain if there is a State or federal record of criminal history for the prospective adoptive or resource family parent or any other adult residing in the prospective parent's home.  The investigation shall be conducted by the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety and shall include an examination of its own files and the obtaining of a similar examination by federal authorities. b.    If the prospective resource family parent or any adult residing in the prospective parent's home has a record of criminal history, the Department of Children and Families shall review the record with respect to the type and date of the criminal offense and make a determination as to the suitability of the person to become a resource family parent or the suitability of placing a child in that person's home, as the case may be. c.     For the purposes of this section, a conviction for one of the offenses enumerated in subsection d. or e. of this section has occurred if the person has been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state or jurisdiction for an offense that is substantially equivalent to the offenses enumerated in these subsections. d.    A person shall be disqualified from being a resource family parent or shall not be eligible to adopt a child if that person or any adult residing in that person's household ever committed a crime which resulted in a conviction for: (1)   a crime against a child, including endangering the welfare of a child and any crime involving child [pornography] sexual abuse or exploitation material pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4; or child abuse, neglect, or abandonment pursuant to R.S.9:6-3; (2)   murder pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-3 or manslaughter pursuant to N.J.S.2C:11-4; (3)   aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the second or third degree pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (4)   stalking pursuant to P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); (5)   kidnapping and related offenses including criminal restraint; false imprisonment; interference with custody; criminal coercion; or enticing a child into a motor vehicle, structure, or isolated area pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1 through 2C:13-6; (6)   sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, or lewdness pursuant to N.J.S.2C:14-2 through N.J.S.2C:14-4; (7)   robbery which would constitute a crime of the first degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:15-1; (8)   burglary which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:18-2; (9)   domestic violence pursuant to P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.); (10) endangering the welfare of an incompetent person pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-7 or endangering the welfare of an elderly or disabled person pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-8; (11) terrorist threats pursuant to N.J.S.2C:12-3; (12) arson pursuant to N.J.S.2C:17-1, or causing or risking widespread injury or damage which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:17-2; or (13) an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense listed in paragraphs (1) through (12) of this subsection. e.     A person shall be disqualified from being a resource family parent if that person or any adult residing in that person's household was convicted of one of the following crimes and the date of release from confinement occurred during the preceding five years: (1)   simple assault pursuant to subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (2)   aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the fourth degree pursuant to subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1; (3)   a drug-related crime pursuant to P.L.1987, c.106 (C.2C:35-1 et seq.); (4)   robbery which would constitute a crime of the second degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:15-1; (5)   burglary which would constitute a crime of the third degree pursuant to N.J.S.2C:18-2; or (6)   an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense listed in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, the "date of release from confinement" means the date of termination of court-ordered supervision through probation, parole, or residence in a correctional facility, whichever date occurs last. For purposes of this section, "resource family parent" means any person with whom a child in the care, custody, or guardianship of the Department of Children and Families is placed by the department, or with its approval, for care and shall include any person with whom a child is placed by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency for the purpose of adoption until the adoption is finalized.

(cf: P.L.2001, c.334, s.1) 17.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill updates terminology in statutory law pertaining to the sexual exploitation or abuse of children. Current state law prohibits the creation, manufacture, distribution, sale or viewing of child pornography.  Among child protection advocates, however, terms such as child sexual abuse material and child sexual exploitation material have come into wider use, replacing the general description of child pornography because these terms more accurately reflect the suffering of the children who are victims of these crimes.  When used in the context of depictions of children, the term pornography may be understood to legitimize or trivialize the sexual abuse or exploitation of those children. In addition, the term pornography carries with it the implication that the acts are performed with the consent of the child, and represent legitimate sexual material. This bill replaces the term child pornography with the term trade in child sexual abuse or exploitation material in Title 2A.  In Title 2C, the definition of item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is amended to include child sexual abuse or exploitation material and the acronym CSAEM. The bill replaces the term child pornography with network to share child sexual abuse or exploitation material in various sections of Title 2C concerning the definition, degrees of crime, examination referrals, registration of sex offenders, and special sentencing for parole supervision for life for a leader of a network distributing depictions of child sexual abuse or exploitation.        The bill further clarifies that online distribution or possession of sexual abuse or exploitation material is to be included in the schedule of penalties pertaining to offenses involving computer criminal activity in Title 2C. In Title 9, the term pornography is replaced with any crime involving child sexual abuse or exploitation material concerning disqualification of employment pursuant to N.J.S.9:3-40.5. In Title 18A, the word pornography is replaced with the term child sexual abuse or exploitation material with regard to the practice of sexting, or sending sexually explicit messages pursuant to N.J.S.18A:35-4.32. This bill replaces the term pornography in various parts of Title 30 with any crime involving child sexual abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning revocation of a day care centers registration, criteria for permanent disqualification from employment, disqualification from adopting a child or being a resource family parent, and disqualification of employment at, or ownership or sponsorship of, a child day care center. In Title 52, the term pornography is replaced with online distribution or possession of child sexual abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning the Department of Law and Public Safetys efforts to receive and respond to inquiries or complaints from members of the public reporting computer crimes pursuant to N.J.S.52:17B-193. This bill also updates the terminology used in current law to replace outdated references to certain crimes that involve the sexual exploitation or abuse of children.  According to the sponsor, the changes made in this bill are not intended, nor should they be construed, to have any substantive impact on the applicability of the affected provisions; the changes are intended to render the terminology consistent with the rest of the current statutory scheme and the broader international trend. The bill also corrects technical inconsistencies in the statutes.
