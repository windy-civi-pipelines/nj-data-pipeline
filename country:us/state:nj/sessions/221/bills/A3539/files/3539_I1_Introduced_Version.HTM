conviction or release from incarceration, whichever is later, and that the
person is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others if released from
parole supervision. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 22 of P.L.1979,

a term of imprisonment, unless the court is clearly convinced that the
interests of justice so far outweigh the need to deter this conduct and the
interest in public safety that a sentence to imprisonment would be a manifest
injustice. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude subjecting a person who

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill updates terminology
in statutory law pertaining to the sexual exploitation or abuse of children. 
Current state law prohibits the creation, manufacture, distribution, sale or
viewing of child pornography.  Among child protection advocates, however, terms
such as child sexual abuse material and child sexual exploitation material
have come into wider use, replacing the general description of child
pornography because these terms more accurately reflect the suffering of the
children who are victims of these crimes.  When used in the context of
depictions of children, the term pornography may be understood to legitimize
or trivialize the sexual abuse or exploitation of those children. In addition,
the term pornography carries with it the implication that the acts are
performed with the consent of the child, and represent legitimate sexual
material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill replaces the term
child pornography with the term trade in child sexual abuse or exploitation
material in Title 2A.  In Title 2C, the definition of item depicting the
sexual exploitation or abuse of a child is amended to include child sexual
abuse or exploitation material and the acronym CSAEM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill replaces the term
child pornography with network to share child sexual abuse or exploitation
material in various sections of Title 2C concerning the definition, degrees of
crime, examination referrals, registration of sex offenders, and special
sentencing for parole supervision for life for a leader of a network
distributing depictions of child sexual abuse or exploitation.        The bill
further clarifies that online distribution or possession of sexual abuse or
exploitation material is to be included in the schedule of penalties pertaining
to offenses involving computer criminal activity in Title 2C<b>. </b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In Title 9, the term
pornography is replaced with any crime involving child sexual abuse or
exploitation material concerning disqualification of employment pursuant to
N.J.S.9:3-40.5.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In Title 18A, the word
pornography is replaced with the term child sexual abuse or exploitation
material with regard to the practice of sexting, or sending sexually
explicit messages pursuant to N.J.S.18A:35-4.32.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill replaces the term
pornography in various parts of Title 30 with any crime involving child sexual
abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning revocation of a day
care centers registration, criteria for permanent disqualification from
employment, disqualification from adopting a child or being a resource family
parent, and disqualification of employment at, or ownership or sponsorship of,
a child day care center.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>In Title 52, the term
pornography is replaced with online distribution or possession of child sexual
abuse or exploitation material in the statutes concerning the Department of
Law and Public Safetys efforts to receive and respond to inquiries or
complaints from members of the public reporting computer crimes pursuant to
N.J.S.52:17B-193.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also updates the
terminology used in current law to replace outdated references to certain
crimes that involve the sexual exploitation or abuse of children.  According to
the sponsor, the changes made in this bill are not intended, nor should they be
construed, to have any substantive impact on the applicability of the affected
provisions; the changes are intended to render the terminology consistent with
the rest of the current statutory scheme and the broader international trend.
The bill also corrects technical inconsistencies in the statutes. </p>
