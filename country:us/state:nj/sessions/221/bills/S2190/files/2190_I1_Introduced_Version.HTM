<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act </span>requiring
certain State agencies to use available data to streamline processes for
individuals filing income tax returns and making public assistance applications,
amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law, and making an
appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New Section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Each year, many
low-income New Jersey residents do not file State or federal income tax returns
because their annual income falls below the minimum threshold established for
filing State and federal tax returns, and the residents do not realize that
they may qualify for the federal and State Earned Income Tax Credit.  Other
State residents may not file tax returns because: 1) the individuals have
difficulty accessing requisite tax forms, 2) the taxpayers did not receive
their tax documents in the mail, or 3) the individuals may find the task of
completing and mailing State and federal tax returns to be overly time
consuming or burdensome.  These taxpayers may be more likely to file a tax
return if they had access to free assistance in preparing and filing State and
federal tax returns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    While New Jersey offers
a broad range of social services programs to serve low-income residents, many
individuals do not apply for all of the programs for which they qualify, for a
variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   individuals may be
unaware of the range of programs for which they may qualify;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   some individuals seeking
social services may be discouraged by the need to complete separate and complex
applications for each assistance program; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   many State residents
find the task of locating and gathering the various income and financial
information required to apply for each safety net program overly burdensome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Division of
Taxation within the Department of the Treasury has ready access to a taxpayers
wage information, as reported to the division by the taxpayers employer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Residents of New Jersey
would greatly benefit from a program that harnesses the States existing tax
filing process to facilitate low income residents in accessing essential safety
net benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Such a program would
ultimately increase State revenues, since it would increase the number of
residents filing taxes, and would result in a savings to the State by creating
efficiencies in enrolling residents in social services programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    R.S.54:50-9 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54:50-9.  Nothing herein
contained shall be construed to prevent:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The delivery to a
taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a copy of any
report or any other paper filed by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of
this subtitle or of any such State tax law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The publication of
statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of a particular
report and the items thereof;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The director, in the
director's discretion and subject to reasonable conditions imposed by the
director, from disclosing the name and address of any licensee under any State
tax law, unless expressly prohibited by such State tax law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The inspection by the Attorney
General or other legal representative of this State of the reports or files
relating to the claim of any taxpayer who shall bring an action to review or
set aside any tax imposed under any State tax law or against whom an action or
proceeding has been instituted in accordance with the provisions thereof;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The examination of said
records and files by the Comptroller, State Auditor or State Commissioner of
Finance, or by their respective duly authorized agents;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The furnishing, at the
discretion of the director, of any information contained in tax reports or
returns or any audit thereof or the report of any investigation made with
respect thereto, filed pursuant to the tax laws, to the taxing officials of any
other state, the District of Columbia, the United States and the territories
thereof, providing said jurisdictions grant like privileges to this State and
providing such information is to be used for tax purposes only;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The furnishing, at the
discretion of the director, of any material information disclosed by the
records or files to any law enforcing authority of this State who shall be
charged with the investigation or prosecution of any violation of the criminal
provisions of this subtitle or of any State tax law;</p>

director to the State agency responsible for administering the Child Support
Enforcement program pursuant to Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act,
Pub.L.93-647 (42 U.S.C. s.651 et seq.), with the names, home addresses, social
security numbers and sources of income and assets of all absent parents who are
certified by that agency as being required to pay child support, upon request
by the State agency and pursuant to procedures and in a form prescribed by the
director;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The furnishing by the director

Treasury, which will manage the program in partnership with the Department of
Human Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Community Affairs,
and the Department of Agriculture.  The ReadyReturn Program, which is modeled
after a pilot program that the State of California initiated in 2005, is an
optional tax return filing method that provides eligible taxpayers tax returns
using data already collected by the division from reports from employers and
other sources.  The division will then share income and other data, derived
from W-2 and income tax forms, with the Department of Human Services (DHS), the
Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) in order to routinely identify and enroll
individuals, including dependent minors, who may be eligible for certain social
services programs administered by the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the intent of the bills
sponsor to harness the States existing tax filing process to facilitate low
income residents in accessing essential safety net benefits, such as cash,
nutrition, subsidized child care, and heating assistance.  The ReadyReturn
Program is designed to increase the income tax data gathered by the State
through the removal of any obstacles in the preparation of a tax return. 
Subsequently, various State departments can use the data collected to
streamline and expedite the application process for social services programs. 
As a result, the State should realize increased revenues from the higher number
of residents filing tax returns, and should realize General Fund savings from
increased efficiencies in enrolling individuals in social services programs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, for taxable
years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury is to prepare, as part of the ReadyReturn Program,
an electronic tax return for any taxpayer whose wages were reported by the
taxpayers employer to the division, using the data from that report to
calculate the return.  An eligible taxpayer may participate in the program by
filing the tax return prepared for the taxpayer pursuant to the bill.  A tax
return prepared pursuant to the bill is to include: a record of the taxpayers
wages for the taxable year; and the tax liability of the taxpayer based on the
income of the taxpayer for the taxable year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division is to develop an
alternative method for an eligible taxpayer to request the taxpayers completed
tax return in paper form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division is to notify each
taxpayer that is eligible for a tax return prepared pursuant to the bill that
the ReadyReturn Program is a filing option available to eligible taxpayers. 
The notification is to include the following information: a description of the
program; the taxpayers eligibility for participation in the program and the
taxpayers ability to view or file a tax return prepared for the taxpayer
pursuant to the program; and that the taxpayers participation in the program
is optional.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill requires
the division to electronically provide data from W-2 forms and income tax
returns to the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA, and amends current statute to newly
authorize the division to share earnings and tax data with these departments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The departments will utilize
the income and other data from the division to identify and screen New Jersey
residents for eligibility for the social services programs under their purview,
such as:  the Work First New Jersey Program; subsidized child care programs;
the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Special Supplemental
Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children program; the Low-Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, and free and reduced-price school meals during the school
year and in the summer.  Where feasible, and permitted under State and federal
statute and regulation, the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA will confer presumptive
eligibility for all social services programs for which an individual is
eligible.  Subsequent to a presumptive eligibility determination, the
departments will notify the individual in question of the individuals
enrollment in a social services program, and secure authorization for services
and benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of an individual
for whom an eligibility determination cannot be made based on the available
information, the departments will initiate contact to: 1) notify the individual
of their potential eligibility for assistance or services under one or more
programs, 2) obtain any information needed to determine the individuals
eligibility for these programs, 3) secure the individuals authorization to be
provided social services through one or more programs; and, 4) expeditiously
enroll the individual in any social services programs for which the individual is
eligible.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the DHS, DOH,
DCA and DOA are also authorized to automatically issue a redetermination of
benefits, using the same income and tax data provided by the division. 
Beneficiaries of social services programs will be notified of the outcome of
any redetermination of benefits.  For any beneficiary for whom continued
eligibility for a social services program cannot be determined from the
available income and tax data, the department overseeing the program shall
contact the beneficiary to secure the requisite information.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
authorizes the commissioners of the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to submit any state
plan amendments or federal waivers needed to implement the requirements of the
bill, and to ensure continued federal financial participation for the relevant
social services programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill appropriates
from the General Fund such sums as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of
the ReadyReturn Program.  The State Treasurer is authorized to determine the
amount of funding, from the total amount appropriated, to be allocated to the
DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to fulfill each departments responsibilities under the
ReadyReturn Program.</p>
