S2190 SENATE, No. 2190 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) SYNOPSIS Establishes ReadyReturn program; requires Taxation to prepare initial tax filing for certain taxpayers; requires several State agencies to use tax data to facilitate identification and enrollment for certain social services programs; makes an appropriation. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act requiring certain State agencies to use available data to streamline processes for individuals filing income tax returns and making public assistance applications, amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New Section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Each year, many low-income New Jersey residents do not file State or federal income tax returns because their annual income falls below the minimum threshold established for filing State and federal tax returns, and the residents do not realize that they may qualify for the federal and State Earned Income Tax Credit.  Other State residents may not file tax returns because: 1) the individuals have difficulty accessing requisite tax forms, 2) the taxpayers did not receive their tax documents in the mail, or 3) the individuals may find the task of completing and mailing State and federal tax returns to be overly time consuming or burdensome.  These taxpayers may be more likely to file a tax return if they had access to free assistance in preparing and filing State and federal tax returns. b.    While New Jersey offers a broad range of social services programs to serve low-income residents, many individuals do not apply for all of the programs for which they qualify, for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: (1)   individuals may be unaware of the range of programs for which they may qualify; (2)   some individuals seeking social services may be discouraged by the need to complete separate and complex applications for each assistance program; and (3)   many State residents find the task of locating and gathering the various income and financial information required to apply for each safety net program overly burdensome. c.     The Division of Taxation within the Department of the Treasury has ready access to a taxpayers wage information, as reported to the division by the taxpayers employer. d.    Residents of New Jersey would greatly benefit from a program that harnesses the States existing tax filing process to facilitate low income residents in accessing essential safety net benefits. e.     Such a program would ultimately increase State revenues, since it would increase the number of residents filing taxes, and would result in a savings to the State by creating efficiencies in enrolling residents in social services programs. 2.    R.S.54:50-9 is amended to read as follows: 54:50-9.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent: a.     The delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a copy of any report or any other paper filed by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of this subtitle or of any such State tax law; b.    The publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of a particular report and the items thereof; c.     The director, in the director's discretion and subject to reasonable conditions imposed by the director, from disclosing the name and address of any licensee under any State tax law, unless expressly prohibited by such State tax law; d.    The inspection by the Attorney General or other legal representative of this State of the reports or files relating to the claim of any taxpayer who shall bring an action to review or set aside any tax imposed under any State tax law or against whom an action or proceeding has been instituted in accordance with the provisions thereof; e.     The examination of said records and files by the Comptroller, State Auditor or State Commissioner of Finance, or by their respective duly authorized agents; f.     The furnishing, at the discretion of the director, of any information contained in tax reports or returns or any audit thereof or the report of any investigation made with respect thereto, filed pursuant to the tax laws, to the taxing officials of any other state, the District of Columbia, the United States and the territories thereof, providing said jurisdictions grant like privileges to this State and providing such information is to be used for tax purposes only;

STATEMENT This bill establishes the ReadyReturn Program in the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, which will manage the program in partnership with the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Community Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture.  The ReadyReturn Program, which is modeled after a pilot program that the State of California initiated in 2005, is an optional tax return filing method that provides eligible taxpayers tax returns using data already collected by the division from reports from employers and other sources.  The division will then share income and other data, derived from W-2 and income tax forms, with the Department of Human Services (DHS), the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in order to routinely identify and enroll individuals, including dependent minors, who may be eligible for certain social services programs administered by the State. It is the intent of the bills sponsor to harness the States existing tax filing process to facilitate low income residents in accessing essential safety net benefits, such as cash, nutrition, subsidized child care, and heating assistance.  The ReadyReturn Program is designed to increase the income tax data gathered by the State through the removal of any obstacles in the preparation of a tax return. Subsequently, various State departments can use the data collected to streamline and expedite the application process for social services programs. As a result, the State should realize increased revenues from the higher number of residents filing tax returns, and should realize General Fund savings from increased efficiencies in enrolling individuals in social services programs Under the bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is to prepare, as part of the ReadyReturn Program, an electronic tax return for any taxpayer whose wages were reported by the taxpayers employer to the division, using the data from that report to calculate the return.  An eligible taxpayer may participate in the program by filing the tax return prepared for the taxpayer pursuant to the bill.  A tax return prepared pursuant to the bill is to include: a record of the taxpayers wages for the taxable year; and the tax liability of the taxpayer based on the income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. The division is to develop an alternative method for an eligible taxpayer to request the taxpayers completed tax return in paper form. The division is to notify each taxpayer that is eligible for a tax return prepared pursuant to the bill that the ReadyReturn Program is a filing option available to eligible taxpayers. The notification is to include the following information: a description of the program; the taxpayers eligibility for participation in the program and the taxpayers ability to view or file a tax return prepared for the taxpayer pursuant to the program; and that the taxpayers participation in the program is optional. In addition, the bill requires the division to electronically provide data from W-2 forms and income tax returns to the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA, and amends current statute to newly authorize the division to share earnings and tax data with these departments. The departments will utilize the income and other data from the division to identify and screen New Jersey residents for eligibility for the social services programs under their purview, such as:  the Work First New Jersey Program; subsidized child care programs; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children program; the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and free and reduced-price school meals during the school year and in the summer.  Where feasible, and permitted under State and federal statute and regulation, the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA will confer presumptive eligibility for all social services programs for which an individual is eligible.  Subsequent to a presumptive eligibility determination, the departments will notify the individual in question of the individuals enrollment in a social services program, and secure authorization for services and benefits. In the case of an individual for whom an eligibility determination cannot be made based on the available information, the departments will initiate contact to: 1) notify the individual of their potential eligibility for assistance or services under one or more programs, 2) obtain any information needed to determine the individuals eligibility for these programs, 3) secure the individuals authorization to be provided social services through one or more programs; and, 4) expeditiously enroll the individual in any social services programs for which the individual is eligible. Under this bill, the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA are also authorized to automatically issue a redetermination of benefits, using the same income and tax data provided by the division. Beneficiaries of social services programs will be notified of the outcome of any redetermination of benefits.  For any beneficiary for whom continued eligibility for a social services program cannot be determined from the available income and tax data, the department overseeing the program shall contact the beneficiary to secure the requisite information. In addition, the bill authorizes the commissioners of the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to submit any state plan amendments or federal waivers needed to implement the requirements of the bill, and to ensure continued federal financial participation for the relevant social services programs. Finally, the bill appropriates from the General Fund such sums as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the ReadyReturn Program.  The State Treasurer is authorized to determine the amount of funding, from the total amount appropriated, to be allocated to the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to fulfill each departments responsibilities under the ReadyReturn Program.

S2190 SENATE, No. 2190 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) SYNOPSIS Establishes ReadyReturn program; requires Taxation to prepare initial tax filing for certain taxpayers; requires several State agencies to use tax data to facilitate identification and enrollment for certain social services programs; makes an appropriation. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act requiring certain State agencies to use available data to streamline processes for individuals filing income tax returns and making public assistance applications, amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New Section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Each year, many low-income New Jersey residents do not file State or federal income tax returns because their annual income falls below the minimum threshold established for filing State and federal tax returns, and the residents do not realize that they may qualify for the federal and State Earned Income Tax Credit.  Other State residents may not file tax returns because: 1) the individuals have difficulty accessing requisite tax forms, 2) the taxpayers did not receive their tax documents in the mail, or 3) the individuals may find the task of completing and mailing State and federal tax returns to be overly time consuming or burdensome.  These taxpayers may be more likely to file a tax return if they had access to free assistance in preparing and filing State and federal tax returns. b.    While New Jersey offers a broad range of social services programs to serve low-income residents, many individuals do not apply for all of the programs for which they qualify, for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: (1)   individuals may be unaware of the range of programs for which they may qualify; (2)   some individuals seeking social services may be discouraged by the need to complete separate and complex applications for each assistance program; and (3)   many State residents find the task of locating and gathering the various income and financial information required to apply for each safety net program overly burdensome. c.     The Division of Taxation within the Department of the Treasury has ready access to a taxpayers wage information, as reported to the division by the taxpayers employer. d.    Residents of New Jersey would greatly benefit from a program that harnesses the States existing tax filing process to facilitate low income residents in accessing essential safety net benefits. e.     Such a program would ultimately increase State revenues, since it would increase the number of residents filing taxes, and would result in a savings to the State by creating efficiencies in enrolling residents in social services programs. 2.    R.S.54:50-9 is amended to read as follows: 54:50-9.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent: a.     The delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a copy of any report or any other paper filed by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of this subtitle or of any such State tax law; b.    The publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of a particular report and the items thereof; c.     The director, in the director's discretion and subject to reasonable conditions imposed by the director, from disclosing the name and address of any licensee under any State tax law, unless expressly prohibited by such State tax law;

STATEMENT This bill establishes the ReadyReturn Program in the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, which will manage the program in partnership with the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, the Department of Community Affairs, and the Department of Agriculture.  The ReadyReturn Program, which is modeled after a pilot program that the State of California initiated in 2005, is an optional tax return filing method that provides eligible taxpayers tax returns using data already collected by the division from reports from employers and other sources.  The division will then share income and other data, derived from W-2 and income tax forms, with the Department of Human Services (DHS), the Department of Health (DOH), the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), and the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in order to routinely identify and enroll individuals, including dependent minors, who may be eligible for certain social services programs administered by the State. It is the intent of the bills sponsor to harness the States existing tax filing process to facilitate low income residents in accessing essential safety net benefits, such as cash, nutrition, subsidized child care, and heating assistance.  The ReadyReturn Program is designed to increase the income tax data gathered by the State through the removal of any obstacles in the preparation of a tax return. Subsequently, various State departments can use the data collected to streamline and expedite the application process for social services programs. As a result, the State should realize increased revenues from the higher number of residents filing tax returns, and should realize General Fund savings from increased efficiencies in enrolling individuals in social services programs Under the bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2023, the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is to prepare, as part of the ReadyReturn Program, an electronic tax return for any taxpayer whose wages were reported by the taxpayers employer to the division, using the data from that report to calculate the return.  An eligible taxpayer may participate in the program by filing the tax return prepared for the taxpayer pursuant to the bill.  A tax return prepared pursuant to the bill is to include: a record of the taxpayers wages for the taxable year; and the tax liability of the taxpayer based on the income of the taxpayer for the taxable year. The division is to develop an alternative method for an eligible taxpayer to request the taxpayers completed tax return in paper form. The division is to notify each taxpayer that is eligible for a tax return prepared pursuant to the bill that the ReadyReturn Program is a filing option available to eligible taxpayers. The notification is to include the following information: a description of the program; the taxpayers eligibility for participation in the program and the taxpayers ability to view or file a tax return prepared for the taxpayer pursuant to the program; and that the taxpayers participation in the program is optional. In addition, the bill requires the division to electronically provide data from W-2 forms and income tax returns to the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA, and amends current statute to newly authorize the division to share earnings and tax data with these departments. The departments will utilize the income and other data from the division to identify and screen New Jersey residents for eligibility for the social services programs under their purview, such as:  the Work First New Jersey Program; subsidized child care programs; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program; the Special Supplemental Nutrition for Women, Infants, and Children program; the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and free and reduced-price school meals during the school year and in the summer.  Where feasible, and permitted under State and federal statute and regulation, the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA will confer presumptive eligibility for all social services programs for which an individual is eligible.  Subsequent to a presumptive eligibility determination, the departments will notify the individual in question of the individuals enrollment in a social services program, and secure authorization for services and benefits. In the case of an individual for whom an eligibility determination cannot be made based on the available information, the departments will initiate contact to: 1) notify the individual of their potential eligibility for assistance or services under one or more programs, 2) obtain any information needed to determine the individuals eligibility for these programs, 3) secure the individuals authorization to be provided social services through one or more programs; and, 4) expeditiously enroll the individual in any social services programs for which the individual is eligible. Under this bill, the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA are also authorized to automatically issue a redetermination of benefits, using the same income and tax data provided by the division. Beneficiaries of social services programs will be notified of the outcome of any redetermination of benefits.  For any beneficiary for whom continued eligibility for a social services program cannot be determined from the available income and tax data, the department overseeing the program shall contact the beneficiary to secure the requisite information. In addition, the bill authorizes the commissioners of the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to submit any state plan amendments or federal waivers needed to implement the requirements of the bill, and to ensure continued federal financial participation for the relevant social services programs. Finally, the bill appropriates from the General Fund such sums as are necessary to effectuate the purposes of the ReadyReturn Program.  The State Treasurer is authorized to determine the amount of funding, from the total amount appropriated, to be allocated to the DHS, DOH, DCA and DOA to fulfill each departments responsibilities under the ReadyReturn Program.
