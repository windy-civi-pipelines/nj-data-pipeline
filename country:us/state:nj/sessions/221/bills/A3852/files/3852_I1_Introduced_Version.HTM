CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the production and use of psilocybin for certain purposes, decriminalizing and expunging past convictions for certain psilocybin-related conduct, and supplementing Title 24 of the Revised Statutes and Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jersey has a high prevalence of adults living with behavioral health conditions. b.    Studies conducted by nationally and internationally recognized medical institutions indicate that psilocybin has shown efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of a variety of behavioral health conditions, including, but not limited to, clinical dependence disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, and end-of-life psychological distress. c.     The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that preliminary clinical evidence indicates psilocybin may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies for treatment-resistant depression, and has granted a breakthrough therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression. d.    It is the intent of the Legislature to facilitate the establishment of safe, legal, and affordable psilocybin service centers to provide residents of New Jersey who are 21 years of age or older with opportunities for supported psilocybin experiences to alleviate distress, provide preventative behavioral health care, and foster wellness and personal growth. e.     In establishing this act, the Legislature seeks to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of all residents of New Jersey, and to prevent and reduce the prevalence of behavioral health disorders in adults, by providing for supported adult use of psilocybin under the supervision of trained and licensed psilocybin service facilitators. f.     The Legislature further seeks to develop a long-term Statewide strategic plan for ensuring that psilocybin services become and remain a safe, accessible, and affordable treatment option for people age 21 and older in New Jersey for whom behavioral health treatment and preventative behavioral health care using psilocybin is appropriate. g.    It is necessary and appropriate to develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme to ensure that psilocybin can be accessed in safe, controlled environments that are designed to foster improvements in behavioral health for adult patients, including establishing requirements for the licensure and regulation of psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service providers, as well as requirements to restrict access to psilocybin to adults age 21 and older and to prevent the unlawful diversion of psilocybin in the State. 3.    As used in this act: 18-month program development period means the period beginning on the effective date of this act and ending 18 months thereafter. Administration session means a session at which a client consumes and experiences the effects of a psilocybin product under the supervision of a psilocybin service facilitator.

no individual may have a financial interest in: (1)   more than one psilocybin product manufacturer; or (2)   more than five psilocybin service centers. b.    The department may require a person issued both a psilocybin product manufacturer license and a psilocybin service center license for the same premises to require the premises be segregated into separate areas for conducting the activities authorized under each license, as may be necessary to protect the public health and safety. 13.  a.  No person who is younger than 21 years of age shall be employed at any psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory.  The department may require a licensee to furnish proof that all employees of the licensee are 21 years of age or older, and may require any person for whom proof of age is unavailable to leave the licensed premises until such time as the person presents acceptable proof of age.  Failure to provide proof of age for an employee within a reasonable period of time shall constitute prima facie evidence that the licensee knowingly employed the person in violation of the requirements of this subsection. b.    No individual may engage in any activities involving the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products, provide psilocybin services, or engage in other activities related to the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services, unless the individual holds a current, valid psilocybin worker permit issued by the department. c.     Each psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, and psilocybin testing laboratory shall

the licensee, possesses a current, valid psilocybin worker permit. d.    An application for a psilocybin worker permit shall be submitted in a form and manner as required by the department.  A psilocybin worker permit shall be valid for one year and shall be subject to renewal.  The department shall establish reasonable application and issuance fees for psilocybin worker permits, which fees shall not exceed the cost to the department of processing the permit application and issuing the permit. e.     The department may require applicants for a psilocybin worker permit to complete a course provided or approved by the department as a condition of issuance of the permit, which course may include training in: (1)   verifying client ages; (2)   detecting signs of client intoxication; (3)   safe and sanitary handling of psilocybin products; (4)   best practices for sanitation and for the safe production, processing, transportation, and storage of psilocybin products; (5)

department may charge, or authorize a course provider to charge, a reasonable fee, not to exceed $250, for a course described in subsection e. of this section. (2)   The department shall not require an individual to attend a course described in subsection e. of this section more than one time, except in cases where the individuals psilocybin worker permit has been suspended or revoked by the department, in which case the department may require the individual to complete the course as a condition of removing the suspension or issuing a new psilocybin worker permit to the individual. 14.  a.  The department shall designate specific psilocybin manufacturing activities that shall be authorized for psilocybin product manufacturers, and a psilocybin product manufacturer shall not engage in a psilocybin manufacturing activity unless the manufacturer holds an endorsement authorizing the manufacturer to engage in that specific activity.  A psilocybin product manufacturer shall not be limited in the number of endorsements the manufacturer holds at one time, and a psilocybin product manufacturer may request approval from the department for additional endorsements at any time.  The department shall approve a request for an additional endorsement unless the department determines that the psilocybin product manufacturer will be unable to meet the requirements for the requested endorsement.  Denial of a request for an additional endorsement shall not preclude a manufacturer from submitting a subsequent request for approval of the same or any other endorsement. b.    The department may restrict the quantity or volume of psilocybin annually produced by a psilocybin product manufacturer, which may include establishing specific, lower quantity or volume limits for psilocybin product manufacturers issued a microbusiness license pursuant to subsection d. of this section.  In establishing quantity or volume restrictions pursuant to this subsection, the department shall take into consideration the demand for psilocybin services in the State, the number of entities issued psilocybin product manufacturer licenses and the number of applicants for psilocybin product manufacturer licenses, and the number of each type of endorsement held by psilocybin product manufacturers, as well as the geographic distribution of licensees, applicants, and endorsements throughout the State. c.     In no case shall psilocybin manufacturing activities be conducted in an outdoor area. d.    (1) The department shall establish a psilocybin product manufacturer microbusiness license, for which the maximum fee assessed by the department for issuance or renewal of the license shall be no more than half the fee applicable to full psilocybin product manufacturer license.  A license issued to a microbusiness shall be valid for one year and may be renewed annually. (2)   A microbusiness shall meet the following requirements: (a)   at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, and employees of the microbusiness shall be residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located, or a municipality bordering the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located; (b)   the microbusiness shall employ no more than 10 employees at one time, inclusive of any owners, officers, and directors of the microbusiness; and (c)   the entire microbusiness facility shall occupy an area of no more than 2,500 square feet. 15.  a.  A psilocybin service center shall not constitute a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.163 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). b.    (1)  Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, a psilocybin service center shall not be approved for any location that is entirely zoned for residential use or that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school. (2)   A psilocybin service center may be approved for a location that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school if the psilocybin service center is not located within 500 feet of an elementary or secondary school and the department determines that there is a physical or geographic barrier capable of preventing children from traversing the premises of the psilocybin service center. (3)   An existing psilocybin service center shall not be required to relocate in the event an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center for such time as the psilocybin service center continues to hold a valid license issued by the department.  The department may not revoke the license of a psilocybin service center solely on the grounds that an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center. c.     Psilocybin service center operators shall take steps to prevent noisy, lewd, disorderly, and disruptive conduct on the licensees premises, and shall ensure the premises are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. 16.  a.  Psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service centers shall not advertise any psilocybin products to the public, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit: (1)   a psilocybin service center from furnishing information concerning psilocybin products that are available from the psilocybin service center to clients within the interior premises of the psilocybin service center or during the course of a preparation session; or (2)   a psilocybin product manufacturer from providing information concerning the manufacturers products to psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators. b.    Psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators may advertise psilocybin services, provided such advertisements do not: (1)   appeal to minors; (2)   promote excessive use of psilocybin; (3)   promote illegal activity; (4)   violate the code of professional conduct for psilocybin service facilitators; or (5)   otherwise present a significant risk to public health and safety. 17.  a.  Each applicant for a psilocybin service facilitator license shall submit documentation proving that the applicant: (1)   is 21 years of age or older; (2)   has a high school diploma or its equivalent; (3)   has completed the education and training requirements established by the department for licensure as a psilocybin service facilitator; (4)   has successfully completed any examination as may be required by the department; and (5)   has met any other requirements for licensure established by the department. b.

STATEMENT This bill, designated the Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Act, establishes a framework for the regulated production and use of psilocybin in connection with behavioral health care and preventative behavioral health treatment, decriminalizes the production, dispensing, and use of psilocybin by persons over 21 years of age, and expunges past and pending offenses for conduct involving psilocybin that is authorized under the bill. Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Advisory Board The bill establishes in the Department of Health (DOH) the Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Advisory Board.  The board will comprise 18 members, including: 1)    the Commissioner of Health, the Deputy Commissioner for Public Health Services, and the Attorney General, or their designees, who will serve as ex officio, nonvoting members; 2)    a representative from the DOH who is familiar with public health programs and public health activities in New Jersey and a designee of the Public Health Council in the Department of Health, who will serve at the pleasure of the commissioner as nonvoting members; 3)    a representative from the Cannabis Regulatory Commission who has expertise in the tracking of cannabis items, who will serve at the pleasure of the commission as a nonvoting member; and 4)    12 public members, to be appointed by the Governor, which members are to include individuals with expertise in areas related to behavioral health care; public health; clinical research related to the use of psychedelic compounds in clinical therapy; mycology, ethnobotany, or psychopharmacology;  issues confronting veterans; the traditional, cultural, and religious uses of psilocybin; emergency medical services; harm reduction and drug policy; and racial and economic equity and health care access. The public members of the board will serve for a term of four years, with staggered terms of appointment for the members first appointed, and will be eligible for reappointment.  The Governor will be required to appoint the public members no later than 60 days after the effective date of the bill.  The board will organize upon the appointment of the public members and select a chairperson and a vice-chairperson from among the membership.  The chairperson will appoint a secretary, who need not be a member of the board.  The members of the board will serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, within the limits of funds made available to the board for this purpose. During an 18-month program development period established under the bill, the board will be required to meet at least once every calendar month, at a time and place designated by the chairperson.  Following the end of the 18-month program development period, the board will meet at least quarterly at a time and place designated by the chairperson.  The board will additionally meet at any time at the call of the chairperson or at the call of a majority of the public members.  The board will be authorized to establish committees and subcommittees as are necessary for the boards operation. The purpose of the board will be to provide advice and recommendations to the DOH, upon request or upon the boards own initiative, concerning the implementation of the bill, including providing recommendations to the department concerning: 1)    educating the public about the use of psilocybin in behavioral health care; 2)    available studies and research concerning the safety of psilocybin and its efficacy in ameliorating behavioral health conditions, as well as the potential for psilocybin to promote community, address trauma, and enhance physical and mental wellness; 3)    the requirements, specifications, and guidelines for providing psilocybin services to a client, including requirements specific to documenting services, screening clients for potential health or safety issues, and providing clients with certain information; 4)    public health and safety standards and industry best practices for psilocybin businesses and psilocybin service facilitators; 5)    the formulation of a code of professional conduct for psilocybin service facilitators; 6)    the education and training requirements for psilocybin service facilitators; 7)    the examinations that psilocybin service facilitators will be required to successfully complete as a condition of licensure; 8)    public health and safety standards and industry best practices for holding and completing a psilocybin administration session, including; 9)    the qualification criteria and amount to be charged in license application and issuance fees; 10)  requirements and restrictions for advertising psilocybin services; 11)  standards, protocols, and best practices for in-home psilocybin administration sessions; 12)  requirements for tracking psilocybin products; 13)  requirements concerning the transportation and delivery of psilocybin products between psilocybin businesses; 14)  requirements for the social opportunity program established under the bill to promote social equity and accessibility; 15)  development of a long-term strategic plan for ensuring that psilocybin services are a safe, accessible, and affordable wellness option; and 16)  monitoring and studying federal laws, regulations, and policies regarding psilocybin. The board will vote upon and submit recommendations to the DOH according to a schedule agreed upon by the DOH. Advice and recommendations are to be made in consideration of federal laws, regulations, and policies concerning psilocybin. No later than 18 months after the effective date of this act, the board will be required to prepare and submit a report to the DOH, the Governor, and the Legislature, outlining its findings and recommendations concerning the implementation of the bill. Psilocybin Licensure Requirements An applicant for an initial or renewed license or permit related to psilocybin will be required to submit the application in a form and manner specified by the DOH.  In the case of an applicant for issuance or renewal of a psilocybin product manufacturer license, psilocybin service center operator license, or psilocybin testing laboratory license, the application is to identify the proposed location of the premises that is to be operated under the license. The DOH will promptly review and approve or deny any application for licensure or issuance of a permit.  The DOH may reject an application that is not submitted in a form and manner required by the department.  An applicant whose application is rejected will not be prohibited from submitting subsequent applications for licensure or a permit, or for renewal of a license or permit.  No psilocybin license or permit may be issued to any applicant who is younger than 21 years of age. The DOH may refuse to issue or renew a license or permit, or may issue a restricted license or permit, to an applicant upon finding that the applicant:  has not completed the requirements for the license or permit; made false statements to the DOH; in the case of a psilocybin manufacturer, service center, or testing permit, demonstrates a lack of capacity or incompetency to carry on the management of the facility that is the subject of the application; has been convicted of violating a federal law, State law, or local ordinance, if the conviction is substantially related to the fitness and ability of the applicant to lawfully carry out activities authorized or required under the license or permit; has an unsatisfactory record of compliance with the requirements of the bill; in the case of an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer license, a psilocybin service center operator license, or a psilocybin testing laboratory license, fails to submit documentation demonstrating that the applicant will have final control of the premises both within six months after the application is submitted and upon approval of the application and, if the applicant will lease the premises, certification from the landlord that the landlord is aware that the tenant's use of the premises will involve activities related to psilocybin; in the case of an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer license, a psilocybin service center operator license, or a psilocybin testing laboratory license, has not demonstrated financial responsibility sufficient to adequately meet the requirements of the facility that is the subject of the application; or for other good cause as determined by the DOH. The application and issuance fees may not exceed the administrative costs to the DOH of processing the application and administering the provisions of the bill.  A license or permit issued under the bill will be valid for one year.  The DOH will be prohibited from issuing any psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, or psilocybin service facilitator license, or any psilocybin worker permit, during the 18-month development period. Each applicant for a license or permit issued under the bill will be required to undergo a criminal history record background check.  The applicant will bear the cost of the criminal history record background check.  The DOH may not approve an applicant for a license or permit under the bill if the criminal history record background information of the applicant reveals a disqualifying conviction for a crime of the first, second, or third degree involving certain offenses involving the production, distribution, or possession of controlled dangerous substances, other than certain offenses involving cannabis or psilocybin.  The DOH may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be issued a license or permit under the bill, for a period not to exceed three months, if the applicant submits to the DOH a sworn statement attesting that the applicant has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction.  The Division of State Police will be required to notify the DOH if any person required to complete a criminal history background check under the bill is subsequently convicted of a disqualifying conviction. Under the bill, an applicant for a license or permit who has a disqualifying conviction may still be issued a license or permit if the applicant has affirmatively demonstrated to the DOH clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation. No application for a psilocybin product manufacturer or psilocybin service center operator license may be approved unless it includes a description of the proposed location for the applicant's site, including:  the proposed location, the surrounding area, and the suitability or advantages of the proposed location, along with a floor plan and optional renderings or architectural or engineering plans; and documentation of zoning approvals for the proposed location. The DOH may require a licensed psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory, or an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license, to submit to the DOH a sworn statement identifying the name and address of each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure, and the nature and extent of the financial interest held by each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure. A person may hold multiple psilocybin service center operator licenses and may hold both a psilocybin product manufacturer license and one or more psilocybin service center operator licenses, which licenses may be issued for the same or for different premises, provided that no individual may have a financial interest in more than one psilocybin product manufacturer or more than five psilocybin service centers. The DOH may require a person issued both a psilocybin product manufacturer license and a psilocybin service center license for the same premises to require the premises be segregated into separate areas for conducting the activities authorized under each license, as may be necessary to protect the public health and safety. The DOH may immediately restrict, suspend, or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to this act if: 1)    the DOH finds probable cause exists that a licensee purchased or received a psilocybin product from an unlicensed source or sold, stored, or transferred a psilocybin product in an unauthorized  manner; 2)    the DOH determines that a person who has a financial interest in a licensee or an applicant for licensure committed or failed to commit an act that disqualifies the individual for licensure; 3)    the DOH finds the licensee made any false representation or statement in the licensees application for licensure or renewal; 4)    the DOH finds the licensee made any false representation or statement to the DOH to conceal a violation of the bill or to otherwise avoid disciplinary action against the licensee; 5)    in the case of a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center operator, the licensee is insolvent, incompetent, or physically unable to manage the operations of the licensed entity; 6)    in the case of a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center operator, the licensee is cited by the department three or more times within a 12-month period for selling or offering for sale mislabeled or adulterated psilocybin products, or for selling or furnishing a psilocybin product to a person who is younger than 21 years of age or who is not a client of the licensee; 7)    following issuance of the license, the licensee is convicted of, adjudicated guilty to, or pleads guilty to a disqualifying conviction; or 8)    the DOH determines that allowing the individual to hold or retain the license would present a risk to the public health and safety. An entity whose application for renewal of a license is denied or whose license is restricted, suspended, or revoked will be entitled to a hearing before the DOH concerning the action. The DOH will issue a final order or decision following the hearing, which final order or decision may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  Notwithstanding the lapse, suspension, or revocation of a license or permit issued under the bill, the DOH may:  proceed with any investigation of, or any action or disciplinary proceeding against, the person who held the license or permit, as applicable; and revise or render void an order suspending or revoking the license or permit, as applicable.  In cases involving the proposed denial of a license or permit, the applicant for licensure or a permit may not withdraw the licensure or permit application that is proposed for denial. Psilocybin Worker Permits No person who is younger than 21 years of age may be employed at any psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory.  The DOH may require a licensee to furnish proof that all employees of the licensee are 21 years of age or older, and may require any person for whom proof of age is unavailable to leave the licensed premises until such time as the person presents acceptable proof of age.  Failure to provide proof of age for an employee within a reasonable period of time will constitute prima facie evidence that the licensee knowingly employed the person in violation of this prohibition. No individual will be authorized to engage in any activities involving the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products, provide psilocybin services, or engage in other activities related to the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services, unless the individual holds a current, valid psilocybin worker permit issued by the DOH.  Each psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, and psilocybin testing laboratory will be required to ensure that each employee of the psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory, as applicable, including any psilocybin service facilitator employed by the licensee, possesses a current, valid psilocybin worker permit. Applications for psilocybin worker permits are to be submitted in a form and manner as required by the DOH.  A psilocybin worker permit will be valid for one year and will be subject to renewal.  The DOH is to establish reasonable application and issuance fees for psilocybin worker permits, which fees may not exceed the cost to the DOH of processing the application and issuing the permit. The DOH may require applicants for a psilocybin worker permit to complete a course provided or approved by the DOH, which course may include training in:  verifying client ages; detecting signs of client intoxication; safe and sanitary handling of psilocybin products; best practices for sanitation and for the safe production, processing, transportation, and storage of psilocybin products; confidentiality requirements; and any other topics the department determines to be appropriate.  The department may charge, or authorize a course provider to charge, a reasonable fee, not to exceed $250 for a psilocybin worker training course.  The DOH may not require an individual to attend a psilocybin worker course more than one time, except in cases where the individuals psilocybin worker permit has been suspended or revoked, in which case the DOH may require the individual to complete the course as a condition of removing the suspension or issuing a new permit to the individual. Psilocybin Product Manufacturers and Service Centers The DOH will designate specific activities that will be authorized for psilocybin product manufacturers, and a psilocybin product manufacturer will not engage in a psilocybin manufacturing activity unless the manufacturer holds an endorsement authorizing the manufacturer to engage in that specific activity.  A psilocybin product manufacturer will not be limited in the number of endorsements the manufacturer holds at one time, and may request approval from the DOH for additional endorsements at any time.  The DOH is to approve a request for an additional endorsement unless the DOH determines that the psilocybin product manufacturer will be unable to meet the requirements for the requested endorsement. Denial of a request for an additional endorsement will not preclude a manufacturer from submitting a subsequent request for approval of the same or any other endorsement. The DOH will be required to establish a psilocybin product manufacturer microbusiness license, the fees for which will be no more than half the fee applicable to full psilocybin product manufacturer license.  A license issued to a microbusiness will be valid for one year and may be renewed annually.  A microbusiness will be required to meet the following requirements:  at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, and employees of the microbusiness are residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located or a bordering municipality; the microbusiness may employ no more than 10 employees at one time, inclusive of any owners, officers, and directors; and the entire microbusiness facility occupies an area of no more than 2,500 square feet. The DOH may restrict the quantity or volume of psilocybin annually produced by a psilocybin product manufacturer, which may include establishing specific, lower quantity or volume limits for psilocybin product manufacturers issued a microbusiness license.  In establishing quantity or volume restrictions, the DOH is to take into consideration the demand for psilocybin services in the State, the number of entities issued psilocybin product manufacturer licenses and the number of applicants for psilocybin product manufacturer licenses, and the number of each type of endorsement held by psilocybin product manufacturers, as well as the geographic distribution of licensees, applicants, and endorsements throughout the State. In no case may psilocybin manufacturing activities be conducted in an outdoor area.  The bill provides that no psilocybin service center may be approved for any location that is entirely zoned for residential use or that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school, subject to certain exceptions.  Psilocybin service center operators will be required to take steps to prevent noisy, lewd, disorderly, and disruptive conduct on the licensees premises and ensure the premises are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.  Psilocybin service centers will not constitute a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.163 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). Psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service centers may not advertise any psilocybin products to the public.  However, psilocybin service centers will be allowed to furnish information concerning psilocybin products that are available from the psilocybin service center to clients present in the interior premises of the center or during the course of a preparation session, and psilocybin product manufacturers may provide information concerning the manufacturers products to psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators. Psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators may advertise psilocybin services, provided such advertisements do not:  appeal to minors; promote excessive use of psilocybin; promote illegal activity; violate the code of professional conduct for psilocybin service facilitators; or otherwise present a significant risk to public health and safety. Psilocybin product manufacturers may not deliver psilocybin products to any location or entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory.  Psilocybin product manufacturers may not receive psilocybin products from any entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer or from a psilocybin service center.  Psilocybin service centers may not sell, furnish, or deliver psilocybin products to any entity other than a client, a psilocybin service center, or a psilocybin testing laboratory, and may not receive psilocybin products from any entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center.  The DOH is to establish requirements concerning the return of psilocybin products by a psilocybin service center to a psilocybin product manufacturer, which requirements are to, at a minimum, identify the circumstances under which psilocybin products may be returned, establish measures to ensure the security and integrity of returned products, and establish requirements to mitigate the risks of adulteration and diversion. Psilocybin product manufacturers will be responsible for ensuring the accurate labeling of all psilocybin products produced and distributed by the manufacturer, which labels are to accurately and comprehensively describe the contents of the product, including, as appropriate, product ingredients, allergen warnings, an expiration or sell by date if needed to ensure product safety and efficacy, as well as anticipated activation time, potency, the size of an individual serving, the total number of servings in the packaged product, and any other information as may be required by the DOH.  The product labeling is to include a clear statement that the product contains psilocybin, which is a psychoactive substance that can produce intoxication when consumed, that the product should be kept out of the reach of people under 21 years of age, and that the product should not be consumed except under the supervision of a psilocybin service facilitator. Psilocybin Service Facilitators Each applicant for a psilocybin service facilitator license will be required to submit documentation to the DOH proving that the applicant:  is 21 years of age or older; has a high school diploma or its equivalent; has completed the education and training requirements for licensure; has successfully completed any required examinations; and has met any other requirements for licensure established by the DOH.  In no case may an applicant for licensure as a psilocybin service facilitator be required to hold a degree issued by an institution of higher education.  A psilocybin service facilitator may be an employee, manager, officer, investor, partner, member, shareholder, or direct or indirect owner of one or more psilocybin service centers.  Psilocybin service facilitators will be authorized to provide psilocybin facilitation services at or through more than one psilocybin service center. Psilocybin Services Psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators will be required to verify the age of a client prior to providing any psilocybin service or selling or furnishing a psilocybin product to the client.  Information collected for the purposes of verifying a clients age may not be retained by a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator and may not be used for any other purpose. Psilocybin services comprise a preparation session, an administration session, and an optional integration session.  A preparation session involves the initial screening of the client to verify the clients age and screen the client for anything that would signal psilocybin is contraindicated for the client.  An administration session is when psilocybin is administered to the client by a psilocybin service facilitator, who remains with the client and guides the client throughout the session.  The preparation session is required before an administration session can take place.  An integration session is an optional session that follows an administration session, during which a psilocybin services facilitator works with the client to process the results of the administration session. A preparation session and an integration session may be held in person at a psilocybin service center or other appropriate location, or remotely using any appropriate form of communication technology as may be authorized by the department by regulation. As a general rule, administration sessions are to be held at a psilocybin service center.  However, a psilocybin service facilitator may provide psilocybin services in a private residence if, for medical reasons, the client is unable to travel to the psilocybin service center.  The psilocybin service center will be required to document the basis upon which an in-home administration session is authorized.  In no case may in-home psilocybin services be provided to a client who is located outside New Jersey. A psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator may refuse to provide psilocybin services to any person for any reason, provided that a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator does not cease to provide psilocybin services during an administration session after the client has consumed a psilocybin product, except under circumstances as may be authorized by the DOH and in conformance with any guidelines and best practices as the DOH may establish for ceasing the provision of psilocybin services during an administration session. In no case may a psilocybin service center or a psilocybin service facilitator sell or furnish a psilocybin product to any person who is visibly intoxicated. A psilocybin service facilitator who is supervising an administrative session may not consume or be under the influence of a psilocybin product during the administrative session. Psilocybin service facilitators will be responsible for: 1)    ensuring the client completes a preparation session prior to initiating an administration session; 2)    ensuring the client is furnished with verbal notice and a written copy of the warnings and other disclosures required by the DOH during the preparation session; 3)    determining whether the client is precluded from receiving services by DOH rule; 4)    prior to initiating an administration session, ensuring the client completes and signs a client information form; 5)    transmitting completed client information forms to the psilocybin service center prior to initiating the administration session; 6)    documenting the completion of all preparation, administration, and integration sessions, as well as the provision of all required warnings and disclosures to the client; and 7)    ensuring the client is offered the opportunity to participate in an integration session following completion of an administration session. Each psilocybin service center will be required to annually report to the DOH:  the total number of clients who were provided psilocybin services during the preceding year, including the number of repeat clients served; the purposes for which clients requested psilocybin services, including the number of requests received for each type of behavioral health condition or other purpose for which psilocybin services were requested; the number of clients who completed a preparation session but not an administration session; the total number of clients who elected to complete an integration session; the total number of in-house administration sessions performed; any adverse events involving a client during an administration session; and assessments of client satisfaction with the psilocybin services provided.  The DOH will be required to make this information publicly available, provided that nothing in the bill is to be construed to authorize the disclosure of any personal identifying information or health information about any individual client, and nothing in the bill is be construed to require any psilocybin service center to disclose to the DOH any personal identifying information or health information about any individual client. No psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or other employee of a psilocybin service center may disclose any information about any client that may be used to identify the client, any confidential health or medical information about a client, or any communications between a client and the psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or employee of the psilocybin service center, unless: 1)    the client, or a person authorized to act on the clients behalf, provides written consent authorizing the disclosure; 2)    disclosure is required to prevent an imminent act that will result in serious physical harm to the client or to any other person; 3)    disclosure is required to report an act of neglect of a minor or an act of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a minor; or 4)    as may be required by the DOH in the course of an investigation involving alleged violations of the provisions of the bill. Psilocybin products purchased by a client from, or sold to a client by, a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator are be consumed by the client on the premises of the psilocybin service center, except in the case of a home visit, in which case the psilocybin product is to be consumed by the client at the location in which the administration session is held.  Psilocybin products may not be consumed by a client except under the supervision of a psilocybin service facilitator.  In order to prevent diversion, accidental ingestion, and accidental injury, the DOH will establish requirements for the disposal of partially consumed, unused, adulterated, expired, and mislabeled psilocybin products. Tracking and Testing Psilocybin Products The DOH may require a psilocybin product manufacturer to test psilocybin products before selling or transferring the psilocybin products to another psilocybin product manufacturer or to a psilocybin service center.  The DOH may also conduct random testing of psilocybin products for the purpose of determining whether a licensee is in compliance with the requirements of the bill.  The DOH may not require a psilocybin product to undergo the same test more than once unless the psilocybin product is processed into a different type of psilocybin product or the condition of the psilocybin product has fundamentally changed.  The testing of psilocybin products will be restricted to laboratories licensed under the bill. For the purpose of tracking the manufacture and administration of psilocybin products and the transfer of psilocybin products between licensed premises, the DOH will be required to either develop a new tracking system or enter into an agreement with the Cannabis Regulatory Commission authorizing the department to use the existing cannabis tracking system.  The DOH will be required to ensure the selected tracking methodology is designed to:  prevent the diversion of psilocybin products to other states; prevent the substitution of and tampering with psilocybin products; ensure accurate accounting of the production, processing, and sale of psilocybin products; ensure that the results of laboratory tests of psilocybin products are accurately reported; and ensure compliance with the requirements of the bill. The tracking system implemented by the DOH will be required, at a minimum, to be capable of tracking:  the manufacture of psilocybin products; the sale of psilocybin products by a psilocybin service center operator to a client; the sale, purchase, transfer, and delivery of psilocybin products between licensees; individual product batches that may be mislabeled, adulterated, or present health or safety risks to clients; and any other information that the DOH determines is reasonably necessary to implement the requirements of the bill. Powers of the Department of Health The bill provides that the DOH will have certain specific duties, powers, and functions, including: 1)    reviewing and making publicly available on its Internet website research, studies, and other information relating to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in behavioral health care; 2)    after the 18-month program development period, comprehensively regulating the system for producing and administering psilocybin in New Jersey; and 3)    promulgating rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill. The DOH will have the power to issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, establish fees, and compel the production of various documentary materials. The bill prohibits the DOH from requiring that a psilocybin product be manufactured by means of chemical synthesis, from prohibiting the use of naturally grown mushrooms that meet quality and safety standards, from mandating the use of patented products or procedures, and from requiring that a client be diagnosed with or have any particular medical or mental health condition as a prerequisite to being provided psilocybin services. If recommended by the advisory board, the department may exclude individuals, or categories of individuals, from receiving psilocybin services, which exclusion may be based on preexisting diagnoses, identified risk factors, or contraindications. Commencing six months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH will be required to post on its Internet website available research, studies, and other information relating to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for behavioral health care, and thereafter is to periodically update the information as may be necessary to ensure the information is current and accurate. No later than six months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH is to establish the necessary forms and commence the process of accepting applications for and approving psilocybin service facilitator training programs.  No later than 18 months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH will be required to establish the necessary forms and commence the process of accepting applications for issuance of psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, psilocybin testing laboratory, and psilocybin service facilitator licenses and psilocybin worker permits. The DOH will be required to establish and administer a social opportunity program to assist individuals who qualify as social opportunity applicants and who otherwise meet the requirements for issuance of a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license.  An applicant for licensure will be eligible for participation in the social opportunity program if:  at least 51 percent of the applicant is owned or controlled by individuals who have lived in a distressed area for five of the past 10 years; the applicant is an entity that has more than 10 full-time employees and has more than half of its employees currently residing in a distressed area; or the applicant is an entity that meets any other eligibility criteria for the social opportunity program as may be established by the DOH.  The applicant will be required to have a primary residence in a distressed area for five of the past 10 years, have demonstrated economic need, and meet any other eligibility criteria for the social opportunity program as may be established by the DOH. For the purposes of implementing the social opportunity program, the DOH will identify geographic areas that are distressed areas, establish appropriate criteria to identify social opportunity applicants, provide technical assistance to social opportunity applicants, provide reduced licensure application, renewal, and issuance fees for social opportunity applicants, and if applicable, create a process for social opportunity applicants to receive points towards a license application score. The DOH is to additionally establish and administer an equitable access program to assist qualified economically disadvantaged individuals with the cost of receiving psilocybin services. The DOH will be authorized to purchase, possess, seize, transfer to a licensee, or dispose of psilocybin products as is necessary for the DOH to ensure compliance with, and enforce the provisions of, the bill.  The DOH may, upon providing the licensee with 72 hours notice, examine the licensees books and may, at any time, conduct an inspection of a licensees premises.  The DOH may allow, but will not require, a licensees books to be maintained on the licensed premises. The DOH may require licensees to maintain general liability insurance, in an amount the DOH determines is reasonably affordable and available, for the purpose of protecting the licensee against damages resulting from a cause of action related to activities authorized under the license held by the licensee. Commencing one year after the end of the 18-month program development period, and annually thereafter, the DOH will be required to prepare, submit to the Governor and the Legislature, and make available on its Internet website, a report concerning the implementation and administration of the bill.  The report will include, at a minimum:  the total number of psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, and psilocybin service facilitator licenses and the total number of psilocybin worker permits issued; the total number of psilocybin facilitator training programs approved; the total number of clients served during the preceding one-year period and the number of those clients who previously received psilocybin services; the purposes for which clients requested psilocybin services, including the types of behavioral health conditions and the nature of any other purposes for which psilocybin services were requested; the number of in-home administration sessions provided during the preceding one-year period; any adverse events reported during the preceding one-year period; the number of psilocybin products tested during the preceding one-year period; any incidents during the preceding one-year period involving, and any disciplinary actions taken in response to, the sale, distribution, or administration of adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively labeled psilocybin products; recommendations for legislation or other action related to the implementation or administration of this act; and any other information or recommendations as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate. Protections and Immunities A psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, psilocybin service facilitator, employee of a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory, or a psilocybin service facilitator or client, who engages in conduct authorized under the bill will be immune from liability for that conduct as it pertains to the States criminal drug laws. Under the bill, it will be unlawful to take any adverse employment action against an employee who receives psilocybin services, unless the employee is visibly impaired while at work, and an employer may not test an employee for the presence of psilocybin in the employees system unless the employee exhibits clear, observable symptoms of impairment. Conduct permitted under the bill will not, by itself, constitute child abuse or neglect, constitute a basis to deny parenting time with a child without a finding of actual threat to the health or welfare of a child based on relevant factors, or constitute a basis to deny eligibility for any public assistance program. Treatment for behavioral health, mental health, or substance use disorders, or other health care a client is otherwise eligible to receive, may not be denied on the basis that the care or treatment is covered in conjunction with psilocybin services or that psilocybin is prohibited by federal law. No contract may be held to be unenforceable on the basis that psilocybin is prohibited by federal law. A holder of a professional or occupational license, certification, or registration will not be subject to professional discipline or loss of a professional license or certification for providing advice or services related to psilocybin or for applications for licensure under the bill. The governing body of a county or municipality may adopt, by ordinance, reasonable regulations on the operation of psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service centers located within that county or municipality.  No county or municipality will be authorized to establish any taxes or fees on the manufacture or sale of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to:  require a government medical assistance program or private health insurer to reimburse a person for costs associated with the use of psilocybin products; prohibit a recipient of a federal grant or an applicant for a federal grant from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psilocybin products to the extent necessary to satisfy federal requirements for the grant; prohibit a party to a federal contract or a person applying to be a party to a federal contract from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psilocybin products to the extent necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract or to satisfy federal requirements for the contract; obstruct the enforcement of federal law; or deem psilocybin services to constitute a medical diagnosis or medical treatment. Other Provisions The bill provides that it will not be unlawful for a person over 21 years of age to possess, store, use, ingest, inhale, process, transport, deliver without consideration, or distribute without consideration, four grams or less of psilocybin.  It will also not be unlawful for a person over 21 years of age to grow, cultivate, or process plants or fungi capable of producing psilocybin for personal use, or to possess the psilocybin produced if the plants and fungi are kept on the grounds of a private home or residence and are kept secure from access by persons under 21 years of age.  It will further not be unlawful to assist another person who is 21 years of age or older or allow property to be used in the course of engaging in such conduct.  The bill specifies that engaging in this authorized conduct will not:  be considered an offense under State law or the laws of any county or municipal governing body; constitute the basis to assess against any person a civil penalty, a civil sanction, or professional or administrative discipline; constitute the basis for detention, search, or arrest of any person; or constitute the basis to deny a person any right or privilege, or to seize or forfeit the assets of any person under State law or the laws of any county or municipal governing body, provided the person is at least 21 years of age. The bill provides that a person convicted of, or who has pending charges for, conduct authorized under the bill that would not constitute an offense or that would constitute a lesser offense were the bill in effect at the time of the offense may petition for resentencing, reversal of conviction and dismissal of case, or modification of judgment and sentence.  Similarly, a person who has completed a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, who would not have been guilty of the offense or who would have been guilty of a lesser offense under the bill had it been in effect at the time of the offense, will be authorized to file a petition to have the conviction dismissed, expunged, and vacated as legally invalid or redesignated as a civil infraction. A court receiving a petition is to presume the petitioner satisfies requirements to have the conviction or charged modified or overturned, unless the State opposes the petition or alleges that granting the petition would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to an identifiable individuals safety.  In the event that the State opposes a petition, the petitioner will be entitled to a hearing on the record, including the opportunity to question witnesses and present evidence supporting the petition. The State will bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the petitioner does not satisfy the criteria or that granting the petition would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to an identifiable individual if alleged.  Unless the State sustains its burden, the court will be required to grant the petition.  Any outstanding fines, court costs, and fees imposed in connection with the conviction at issue will be waived. Under no circumstance will a resentencing, reversal and dismissal, modification, revocation, or acceleration result in the imposition of a supervision or imprisonment term longer than the original sentence, or the reinstatement of charges dismissed pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, or require the payment of any additional fines or fees beyond those authorized by the bill.   Any conviction that is modified, resentenced, or redesignated as a civil infraction under the bill will be considered a civil infraction for all purposes. The bill will take effect the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, except that the Governor and the Commissioner of Health may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as is necessary for the implementation of the bill.

individual may engage in any activities involving the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products, provide psilocybin services, or engage in other activities related to the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services, unless the

The DOH will promptly review and approve or deny any application for licensure or issuance of a permit.  The DOH may reject an application that is not submitted in a form and manner required by the department.  An applicant whose application is rejected will not be prohibited from submitting subsequent applications for licensure or a permit, or for renewal of a license or permit.  No psilocybin license or permit may be issued to any applicant who is younger than 21 years of age. The DOH may refuse to issue or renew a license or permit, or may issue a restricted license or permit, to an applicant upon finding that the applicant:  has not completed the requirements for the license or permit; made false statements to the DOH; in the case of a psilocybin manufacturer, service center, or testing permit, demonstrates a lack of capacity or incompetency to carry on the management of the facility that is the subject of the application; has been convicted of violating a federal law, State law, or local ordinance, if the conviction is substantially related to the fitness and ability of the applicant to lawfully carry out activities authorized or required under the license or permit; has an unsatisfactory record of compliance with the requirements of the bill; in the case of an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer license, a psilocybin service center operator license, or a psilocybin testing laboratory license, fails to submit documentation demonstrating that the applicant will have final control of the premises both within six months after the application is submitted and upon approval of the application and, if the applicant will lease the premises, certification from the landlord that the landlord is aware that the tenant's use of the premises will involve activities related to psilocybin; in the case of an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer license, a psilocybin service center operator license, or a psilocybin testing laboratory license, has not demonstrated financial responsibility sufficient to adequately meet the requirements of the facility that is the subject of the application; or for other good cause as determined by the DOH. The application and issuance fees may not exceed the administrative costs to the DOH of processing the application and administering the provisions of the bill.  A license or permit issued under the bill will be valid for one year.  The DOH will be prohibited from issuing any psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, or psilocybin service facilitator license, or any psilocybin worker permit, during the 18-month development period. Each applicant for a license or permit issued under the bill will be required to undergo a criminal history record background check.  The applicant will bear the cost of the criminal history record background check.  The DOH may not approve an applicant for a license or permit under the bill if the criminal history record background information of the applicant reveals a disqualifying conviction for a crime of the first, second, or third degree involving certain offenses involving the production, distribution, or possession of controlled dangerous substances, other than certain offenses involving cannabis or psilocybin.  The DOH may offer provisional authority for an applicant to be issued a license or permit under the bill, for a period not to exceed three months, if the applicant submits to the DOH a sworn statement attesting that the applicant has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction.  The Division of State Police will be required to notify the DOH if any person required to complete a criminal history background check under the bill is subsequently convicted of a disqualifying conviction. Under the bill, an applicant for a license or permit who has a disqualifying conviction may still be issued a license or permit if the applicant has affirmatively demonstrated to the DOH clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation. No application for a psilocybin product manufacturer or psilocybin service center operator license may be approved unless it includes a description of the proposed location for the applicant's site, including:  the proposed location, the surrounding area, and the suitability or advantages of the proposed location, along with a floor plan and optional renderings or architectural or engineering plans; and documentation of zoning approvals for the proposed location. The DOH may require a licensed psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory, or an applicant for a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license, to submit to the DOH a sworn statement identifying the name and address of each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure, and the nature and extent of the financial interest held by each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure. A person may hold multiple psilocybin service center operator licenses and may hold both a psilocybin product manufacturer license and one or more psilocybin service center operator licenses, which licenses may be issued for the same or for different premises, provided that no individual may have a financial interest in more than one psilocybin product manufacturer or more than five psilocybin service centers. The DOH may require a person issued both a psilocybin product manufacturer license and a psilocybin service center license for the same premises to require the premises be segregated into separate areas for conducting the activities authorized under each license, as may be necessary to protect the public health and safety. The DOH may immediately restrict, suspend, or refuse to renew a license issued pursuant to this act if: 1)    the DOH finds probable cause exists that a licensee purchased or received a psilocybin product from an unlicensed source or sold, stored, or transferred a psilocybin product in an unauthorized  manner; 2)    the DOH determines that a person who has a financial interest in a licensee or an applicant for licensure committed or failed to commit an act that disqualifies the individual for licensure; 3)    the DOH finds the licensee made any false representation or statement in the licensees application for licensure or renewal; 4)    the DOH finds the licensee made any false representation or statement to the DOH to conceal a violation of the bill or to otherwise avoid disciplinary action against the licensee; 5)    in the case of a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center operator, the licensee is insolvent, incompetent, or physically unable to manage the operations of the licensed entity; 6)    in the case of a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center operator, the licensee is cited by the department three or more times within a 12-month period for selling or offering for sale mislabeled or adulterated psilocybin products, or for selling or furnishing a psilocybin product to a person who is younger than 21 years of age or who is not a client of the licensee; 7)    following issuance of the license, the licensee is convicted of, adjudicated guilty to, or pleads guilty to a disqualifying conviction; or 8)    the DOH determines that allowing the individual to hold or retain the license would present a risk to the public health and safety. An entity whose application for renewal of a license is denied or whose license is restricted, suspended, or revoked will be entitled to a hearing before the DOH concerning the action. The DOH will issue a final order or decision following the hearing, which final order or decision may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  Notwithstanding the lapse, suspension, or revocation of a license or permit issued under the bill, the DOH may:  proceed with any investigation of, or any action or disciplinary proceeding against, the person who held the license or permit, as applicable; and revise or render void an order suspending or revoking the license or permit, as applicable.  In cases involving the proposed denial of a license or permit, the applicant for licensure or a permit may not withdraw the licensure or permit application that is proposed for denial. Psilocybin Worker Permits No person who is younger than 21 years of age may be employed at any psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory.  The DOH may require a licensee to furnish proof that all employees of the licensee are 21 years of age or older, and may require any person for whom proof of age is unavailable to leave the licensed premises until such time as the person presents acceptable proof of age.  Failure to provide proof of age for an employee within a reasonable period of time will constitute prima facie evidence that the licensee knowingly employed the person in violation of this prohibition. No individual will be authorized to engage in any activities involving the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products, provide psilocybin services, or engage in other activities related to the manufacture, processing, transportation, delivery, testing, sale, or administration of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services, unless the individual holds a current, valid psilocybin worker permit issued by the DOH.  Each psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, and psilocybin testing laboratory will be required to ensure that each employee of the psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory, as applicable, including any psilocybin service facilitator employed by the licensee, possesses a current, valid psilocybin worker permit. Applications for psilocybin worker permits are to be submitted in a form and manner as required by the DOH.  A psilocybin worker permit will be valid for one year and will be subject to renewal.  The DOH is to establish reasonable application and issuance fees for psilocybin worker permits, which fees may not exceed the cost to the DOH of processing the application and issuing the permit. The DOH may require applicants for a psilocybin worker permit to complete a course provided or approved by the DOH, which course may include training in:  verifying client ages; detecting signs of client intoxication; safe and sanitary handling of psilocybin products; best practices for sanitation and for the safe production, processing, transportation, and storage of psilocybin products; confidentiality requirements; and any other topics the department determines to be appropriate.  The department may charge, or authorize a course provider to charge, a reasonable fee, not to exceed $250 for a psilocybin worker training course.  The DOH may not require an individual to attend a psilocybin worker course more than one time, except in cases where the individuals psilocybin worker permit has been suspended or revoked, in which case the DOH may require the individual to complete the course as a condition of removing the suspension or issuing a new permit to the individual. Psilocybin Product Manufacturers and Service Centers The DOH will designate specific activities that will be authorized for psilocybin product manufacturers, and a psilocybin product manufacturer will not engage in a psilocybin manufacturing activity unless the manufacturer holds an endorsement authorizing the manufacturer to engage in that specific activity.  A psilocybin product manufacturer will not be limited in the number of endorsements the manufacturer holds at one time, and may request approval from the DOH for additional endorsements at any time.  The DOH is to approve a request for an additional endorsement unless the DOH determines that the psilocybin product manufacturer will be unable to meet the requirements for the requested endorsement. Denial of a request for an additional endorsement will not preclude a manufacturer from submitting a subsequent request for approval of the same or any other endorsement. The DOH will be required to establish a psilocybin product manufacturer microbusiness license, the fees for which will be no more than half the fee applicable to full psilocybin product manufacturer license.  A license issued to a microbusiness will be valid for one year and may be renewed annually.  A microbusiness will be required to meet the following requirements:  at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, and employees of the microbusiness are residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located or a bordering municipality; the microbusiness may employ no more than 10 employees at one time, inclusive of any owners, officers, and directors; and the entire microbusiness facility occupies an area of no more than 2,500 square feet. The DOH may restrict the quantity or volume of psilocybin annually produced by a psilocybin product manufacturer, which may include establishing specific, lower quantity or volume limits for psilocybin product manufacturers issued a microbusiness license.  In establishing quantity or volume restrictions, the DOH is to take into consideration the demand for psilocybin services in the State, the number of entities issued psilocybin product manufacturer licenses and the number of applicants for psilocybin product manufacturer licenses, and the number of each type of endorsement held by psilocybin product manufacturers, as well as the geographic distribution of licensees, applicants, and endorsements throughout the State. In no case may psilocybin manufacturing activities be conducted in an outdoor area.  The bill provides that no psilocybin service center may be approved for any location that is entirely zoned for residential use or that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school, subject to certain exceptions.  Psilocybin service center operators will be required to take steps to prevent noisy, lewd, disorderly, and disruptive conduct on the licensees premises and ensure the premises are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.  Psilocybin service centers will not constitute a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.163 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). Psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service centers may not advertise any psilocybin products to the public.  However, psilocybin service centers will be allowed to furnish information concerning psilocybin products that are available from the psilocybin service center to clients present in the interior premises of the center or during the course of a preparation session, and psilocybin product manufacturers may provide information concerning the manufacturers products to psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators. Psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators may advertise psilocybin services, provided such advertisements do not:  appeal to minors; promote excessive use of psilocybin; promote illegal activity; violate the code of professional conduct for psilocybin service facilitators; or otherwise present a significant risk to public health and safety. Psilocybin product manufacturers may not deliver psilocybin products to any location or entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory.  Psilocybin product manufacturers may not receive psilocybin products from any entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer or from a psilocybin service center.  Psilocybin service centers may not sell, furnish, or deliver psilocybin products to any entity other than a client, a psilocybin service center, or a psilocybin testing laboratory, and may not receive psilocybin products from any entity other than a psilocybin product manufacturer or a psilocybin service center.  The DOH is to establish requirements concerning the return of psilocybin products by a psilocybin service center to a psilocybin product manufacturer, which requirements are to, at a minimum, identify the circumstances under which psilocybin products may be returned, establish measures to ensure the security and integrity of returned products, and establish requirements to mitigate the risks of adulteration and diversion. Psilocybin product manufacturers will be responsible for ensuring the accurate labeling of all psilocybin products produced and distributed by the manufacturer, which labels are to accurately and comprehensively describe the contents of the product, including, as appropriate, product ingredients, allergen warnings, an expiration or sell by date if needed to ensure product safety and efficacy, as well as anticipated activation time, potency, the size of an individual serving, the total number of servings in the packaged product, and any other information as may be required by the DOH.  The product labeling is to include a clear statement that the product contains psilocybin, which is a psychoactive substance that can produce intoxication when consumed, that the product should be kept out of the reach of people under 21 years of age, and that the product should not be consumed except under the supervision of a psilocybin service facilitator. Psilocybin Service Facilitators Each applicant for a psilocybin service facilitator license will be required to submit documentation to the DOH proving that the applicant:  is 21 years of age or older; has a high school diploma or its equivalent; has completed the education and training requirements for licensure; has successfully completed any required examinations; and has met any other requirements for licensure established by the DOH.  In no case may an applicant for licensure as a psilocybin service facilitator be required to hold a degree issued by an institution of higher education.  A psilocybin service facilitator may be an employee, manager, officer, investor, partner, member, shareholder, or direct or indirect owner of one or more psilocybin service centers.  Psilocybin service facilitators will be authorized to provide psilocybin facilitation services at or through more than one psilocybin service center. Psilocybin Services Psilocybin service centers and psilocybin service facilitators will be required to verify the age of a client prior to providing any psilocybin service or selling or furnishing a psilocybin product to the client.  Information collected for the purposes of verifying a clients age may not be retained by a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator and may not be used for any other purpose. Psilocybin services comprise a preparation session, an administration session, and an optional integration session.  A preparation session involves the initial screening of the client to verify the clients age and screen the client for anything that would signal psilocybin is contraindicated for the client.  An administration session is when psilocybin is administered to the client by a psilocybin service facilitator, who remains with the client and guides the client throughout the session.  The preparation session is required before an administration session can take place.  An integration session is an optional session that follows an administration session, during which a psilocybin services facilitator works with the client to process the results of the administration session. A preparation session and an integration session may be held in person at a psilocybin service center or other appropriate location, or remotely using any appropriate form of communication technology as may be authorized by the department by regulation. As a general rule, administration sessions are to be held at a psilocybin service center.  However, a psilocybin service facilitator may provide psilocybin services in a private residence if, for medical reasons, the client is unable to travel to the psilocybin service center.  The psilocybin service center will be required to document the basis upon which an in-home administration session is authorized.  In no case may in-home psilocybin services be provided to a client who is located outside New Jersey. A psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator may refuse to provide psilocybin services to any person for any reason, provided that a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator does not cease to provide psilocybin services during an administration session after the client has consumed a psilocybin product, except under circumstances as may be authorized by the DOH and in conformance with any guidelines and best practices as the DOH may establish for ceasing the provision of psilocybin services during an administration session. In no case may a psilocybin service center or a psilocybin service facilitator sell or furnish a psilocybin product to any person who is visibly intoxicated. A psilocybin service facilitator who is supervising an administrative session may not consume or be under the influence of a psilocybin product during the administrative session. Psilocybin service facilitators will be responsible for: 1)    ensuring the client completes a preparation session prior to initiating an administration session; 2)    ensuring the client is furnished with verbal notice and a written copy of the warnings and other disclosures required by the DOH during the preparation session; 3)    determining whether the client is precluded from receiving services by DOH rule; 4)    prior to initiating an administration session, ensuring the client completes and signs a client information form; 5)    transmitting completed client information forms to the psilocybin service center prior to initiating the administration session; 6)    documenting the completion of all preparation, administration, and integration sessions, as well as the provision of all required warnings and disclosures to the client; and 7)    ensuring the client is offered the opportunity to participate in an integration session following completion of an administration session. Each psilocybin service center will be required to annually report to the DOH:  the total number of clients who were provided psilocybin services during the preceding year, including the number of repeat clients served; the purposes for which clients requested psilocybin services, including the number of requests received for each type of behavioral health condition or other purpose for which psilocybin services were requested; the number of clients who completed a preparation session but not an administration session; the total number of clients who elected to complete an integration session; the total number of in-house administration sessions performed; any adverse events involving a client during an administration session; and assessments of client satisfaction with the psilocybin services provided.  The DOH will be required to make this information publicly available, provided that nothing in the bill is to be construed to authorize the disclosure of any personal identifying information or health information about any individual client, and nothing in the bill is be construed to require any psilocybin service center to disclose to the DOH any personal identifying information or health information about any individual client. No psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or other employee of a psilocybin service center may disclose any information about any client that may be used to identify the client, any confidential health or medical information about a client, or any communications between a client and the psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or employee of the psilocybin service center, unless: 1)    the client, or a person authorized to act on the clients behalf, provides written consent authorizing the disclosure; 2)    disclosure is required to prevent an imminent act that will result in serious physical harm to the client or to any other person; 3)    disclosure is required to report an act of neglect of a minor or an act of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a minor; or 4)    as may be required by the DOH in the course of an investigation involving alleged violations of the provisions of the bill. Psilocybin products purchased by a client from, or sold to a client by, a psilocybin service center or psilocybin service facilitator are be consumed by the client on the premises of the psilocybin service center, except in the case of a home visit, in which case the psilocybin product is to be consumed by the client at the location in which the administration session is held.  Psilocybin products may not be consumed by a client except under the supervision of a psilocybin service facilitator.  In order to prevent diversion, accidental ingestion, and accidental injury, the DOH will establish requirements for the disposal of partially consumed, unused, adulterated, expired, and mislabeled psilocybin products. Tracking and Testing Psilocybin Products The DOH may require a psilocybin product manufacturer to test psilocybin products before selling or transferring the psilocybin products to another psilocybin product manufacturer or to a psilocybin service center.  The DOH may also conduct random testing of psilocybin products for the purpose of determining whether a licensee is in compliance with the requirements of the bill.  The DOH may not require a psilocybin product to undergo the same test more than once unless the psilocybin product is processed into a different type of psilocybin product or the condition of the psilocybin product has fundamentally changed.  The testing of psilocybin products will be restricted to laboratories licensed under the bill. For the purpose of tracking the manufacture and administration of psilocybin products and the transfer of psilocybin products between licensed premises, the DOH will be required to either develop a new tracking system or enter into an agreement with the Cannabis Regulatory Commission authorizing the department to use the existing cannabis tracking system.  The DOH will be required to ensure the selected tracking methodology is designed to:  prevent the diversion of psilocybin products to other states; prevent the substitution of and tampering with psilocybin products; ensure accurate accounting of the production, processing, and sale of psilocybin products; ensure that the results of laboratory tests of psilocybin products are accurately reported; and ensure compliance with the requirements of the bill. The tracking system implemented by the DOH will be required, at a minimum, to be capable of tracking:  the manufacture of psilocybin products; the sale of psilocybin products by a psilocybin service center operator to a client; the sale, purchase, transfer, and delivery of psilocybin products between licensees; individual product batches that may be mislabeled, adulterated, or present health or safety risks to clients; and any other information that the DOH determines is reasonably necessary to implement the requirements of the bill. Powers of the Department of Health The bill provides that the DOH will have certain specific duties, powers, and functions, including: 1)    reviewing and making publicly available on its Internet website research, studies, and other information relating to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in behavioral health care; 2)    after the 18-month program development period, comprehensively regulating the system for producing and administering psilocybin in New Jersey; and 3)    promulgating rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill. The DOH will have the power to issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses, establish fees, and compel the production of various documentary materials. The bill prohibits the DOH from requiring that a psilocybin product be manufactured by means of chemical synthesis, from prohibiting the use of naturally grown mushrooms that meet quality and safety standards, from mandating the use of patented products or procedures, and from requiring that a client be diagnosed with or have any particular medical or mental health condition as a prerequisite to being provided psilocybin services. If recommended by the advisory board, the department may exclude individuals, or categories of individuals, from receiving psilocybin services, which exclusion may be based on preexisting diagnoses, identified risk factors, or contraindications. Commencing six months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH will be required to post on its Internet website available research, studies, and other information relating to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for behavioral health care, and thereafter is to periodically update the information as may be necessary to ensure the information is current and accurate. No later than six months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH is to establish the necessary forms and commence the process of accepting applications for and approving psilocybin service facilitator training programs.  No later than 18 months after the effective date of the bill, the DOH will be required to establish the necessary forms and commence the process of accepting applications for issuance of psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, psilocybin testing laboratory, and psilocybin service facilitator licenses and psilocybin worker permits. The DOH will be required to establish and administer a social opportunity program to assist individuals who qualify as social opportunity applicants and who otherwise meet the requirements for issuance of a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license.  An applicant for licensure will be eligible for participation in the social opportunity program if:  at least 51 percent of the applicant is owned or controlled by individuals who have lived in a distressed area for five of the past 10 years; the applicant is an entity that has more than 10 full-time employees and has more than half of its employees currently residing in a distressed area; or the applicant is an entity that meets any other eligibility criteria for the social opportunity program as may be established by the DOH.  The applicant will be required to have a primary residence in a distressed area for five of the past 10 years, have demonstrated economic need, and meet any other eligibility criteria for the social opportunity program as may be established by the DOH. For the purposes of implementing the social opportunity program, the DOH will identify geographic areas that are distressed areas, establish appropriate criteria to identify social opportunity applicants, provide technical assistance to social opportunity applicants, provide reduced licensure application, renewal, and issuance fees for social opportunity applicants, and if applicable, create a process for social opportunity applicants to receive points towards a license application score. The DOH is to additionally establish and administer an equitable access program to assist qualified economically disadvantaged individuals with the cost of receiving psilocybin services. The DOH will be authorized to purchase, possess, seize, transfer to a licensee, or dispose of psilocybin products as is necessary for the DOH to ensure compliance with, and enforce the provisions of, the bill.  The DOH may, upon providing the licensee with 72 hours notice, examine the licensees books and may, at any time, conduct an inspection of a licensees premises.  The DOH may allow, but will not require, a licensees books to be maintained on the licensed premises. The DOH may require licensees to maintain general liability insurance, in an amount the DOH determines is reasonably affordable and available, for the purpose of protecting the licensee against damages resulting from a cause of action related to activities authorized under the license held by the licensee. Commencing one year after the end of the 18-month program development period, and annually thereafter, the DOH will be required to prepare, submit to the Governor and the Legislature, and make available on its Internet website, a report concerning the implementation and administration of the bill.  The report will include, at a minimum:  the total number of psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, and psilocybin service facilitator licenses and the total number of psilocybin worker permits issued; the total number of psilocybin facilitator training programs approved; the total number of clients served during the preceding one-year period and the number of those clients who previously received psilocybin services; the purposes for which clients requested psilocybin services, including the types of behavioral health conditions and the nature of any other purposes for which psilocybin services were requested; the number of in-home administration sessions provided during the preceding one-year period; any adverse events reported during the preceding one-year period; the number of psilocybin products tested during the preceding one-year period; any incidents during the preceding one-year period involving, and any disciplinary actions taken in response to, the sale, distribution, or administration of adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively labeled psilocybin products; recommendations for legislation or other action related to the implementation or administration of this act; and any other information or recommendations as the commissioner deems necessary and appropriate. Protections and Immunities A psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin testing laboratory, psilocybin service facilitator, employee of a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory, or a psilocybin service facilitator or client, who engages in conduct authorized under the bill will be immune from liability for that conduct as it pertains to the States criminal drug laws. Under the bill, it will be unlawful to take any adverse employment action against an employee who receives psilocybin services, unless the employee is visibly impaired while at work, and an employer may not test an employee for the presence of psilocybin in the employees system unless the employee exhibits clear, observable symptoms of impairment. Conduct permitted under the bill will not, by itself, constitute child abuse or neglect, constitute a basis to deny parenting time with a child without a finding of actual threat to the health or welfare of a child based on relevant factors, or constitute a basis to deny eligibility for any public assistance program. Treatment for behavioral health, mental health, or substance use disorders, or other health care a client is otherwise eligible to receive, may not be denied on the basis that the care or treatment is covered in conjunction with psilocybin services or that psilocybin is prohibited by federal law. No contract may be held to be unenforceable on the basis that psilocybin is prohibited by federal law. A holder of a professional or occupational license, certification, or registration will not be subject to professional discipline or loss of a professional license or certification for providing advice or services related to psilocybin or for applications for licensure under the bill. The governing body of a county or municipality may adopt, by ordinance, reasonable regulations on the operation of psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service centers located within that county or municipality.  No county or municipality will be authorized to establish any taxes or fees on the manufacture or sale of psilocybin products or the provision of psilocybin services. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to:  require a government medical assistance program or private health insurer to reimburse a person for costs associated with the use of psilocybin products; prohibit a recipient of a federal grant or an applicant for a federal grant from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psilocybin products to the extent necessary to satisfy federal requirements for the grant; prohibit a party to a federal contract or a person applying to be a party to a federal contract from prohibiting the manufacture, delivery, possession, or use of psilocybin products to the extent necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract or to satisfy federal requirements for the contract; obstruct the enforcement of federal law; or deem psilocybin services to constitute a medical diagnosis or medical treatment. Other Provisions The bill provides that it will not be unlawful for a person over 21 years of age to possess, store, use, ingest, inhale, process, transport, deliver without consideration, or distribute without consideration, four grams or less of psilocybin.  It will also not be unlawful for a person over 21 years of age to grow, cultivate, or process plants or fungi capable of producing psilocybin for personal use, or to possess the psilocybin produced if the plants and fungi are kept on the grounds of a private home or residence and are kept secure from access by persons under 21 years of age.  It will further not be unlawful to assist another person who is 21 years of age or older or allow property to be used in the course of engaging in such conduct.  The bill specifies that engaging in this authorized conduct will not:  be considered an offense under State law or the laws of any county or municipal governing body; constitute the basis to assess against any person a civil penalty, a civil sanction, or professional or administrative discipline; constitute the basis for detention, search, or arrest of any person; or constitute the basis to deny a person any right or privilege, or to seize or forfeit the assets of any person under State law or the laws of any county or municipal governing body, provided the person is at least 21 years of age. The bill provides that a person convicted of, or who has pending charges for, conduct authorized under the bill that would not constitute an offense or that would constitute a lesser offense were the bill in effect at the time of the offense may petition for resentencing, reversal of conviction and dismissal of case, or modification of judgment and sentence.  Similarly, a person who has completed a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea of guilty or nolo contendere, who would not have been guilty of the offense or who would have been guilty of a lesser offense under the bill had it been in effect at the time of the offense, will be authorized to file a petition to have the conviction dismissed, expunged, and vacated as legally invalid or redesignated as a civil infraction. A court receiving a petition is to presume the petitioner satisfies requirements to have the conviction or charged modified or overturned, unless the State opposes the petition or alleges that granting the petition would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to an identifiable individuals safety.  In the event that the State opposes a petition, the petitioner will be entitled to a hearing on the record, including the opportunity to question witnesses and present evidence supporting the petition. The State will bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the petitioner does not satisfy the criteria or that granting the petition would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to an identifiable individual if alleged.  Unless the State sustains its burden, the court will be required to grant the petition.  Any outstanding fines, court costs, and fees imposed in connection with the conviction at issue will be waived. Under no circumstance will a resentencing, reversal and dismissal, modification, revocation, or acceleration result in the imposition of a supervision or imprisonment term longer than the original sentence, or the reinstatement of charges dismissed pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement, or require the payment of any additional fines or fees beyond those authorized by the bill.   Any conviction that is modified, resentenced, or redesignated as a civil infraction under the bill will be considered a civil infraction for all purposes. The bill will take effect the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, except that the Governor and the Commissioner of Health may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as is necessary for the implementation of the bill.
