and (5) promoting partnerships between institutions of higher education in the State and businesses to jointly demonstrate hydrogen and fuel cell technologies and attract greater amounts of federal funding to the State. f.     The center, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, may allocate monies from the Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund to establish, if the center so chooses, a program to be known as the Entrepreneurial Fellowship Program, which may provide loans or loan guarantees to entrepreneurs from business sectors other than clean energy sectors to enroll in programs to foster knowledge and expertise of clean energy technology; provided, however, that the clean energy technology programs shall be based upon intensive technology, market, and policy curriculum and that the center shall establish public-private partnerships and enter into contribution agreements with State-based businesses and venture capitalists to support programs designed to mentor and train entrepreneurs from other business sectors in the areas of clean energy technology and development to increase investment in the States clean energy sector. 11.  Section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.   Simultaneously with the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate: (1)   The costs for the social programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.). The board may subsequently order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the board chooses to modify the program; (2)   Nuclear plant decommissioning costs; (3)   The costs of demand side management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment, and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for energy efficiency , plug-in electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and Class I renewable energy programs that provide environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al..), and provided that 25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells. The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer period of time. The board shall make these determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding; (4)   Manufactured gas plant remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent with mechanisms in the remediation adjustment clauses for the electric public utility and gas public utility adopted by the board; [and] (5)   The cost, of consumer education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that, together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-79), shall be sufficient to fund the consumer education program established pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-85) ; and (6)   100 percent of the costs of the operation of the Clean Energy Technology Center and the Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund, established pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The board may order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect the inclusion of funding for the Clean Energy Technology Center and the Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund. b.    There is established in the Board of Public Utilities a nonlapsing fund to be known as the "Universal Service Fund."  The board shall determine: the level of funding and the appropriate administration of the fund; the purposes and programs to be funded with monies from the fund; which social programs shall be provided by an electric public utility as part of the provision of its regulated services which provide a public benefit; whether the funds appropriated to fund the "Lifeline Credit Program" established pursuant to P.L.1979, c.197 (C.48:2-29.15 et seq.), the "Tenants' Lifeline Assistance Program" established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.210 (C.48:2-29.31 et seq.), the funds received pursuant to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.8621 et seq., and funds collected by electric and natural gas utilities, as authorized by the board, to offset uncollectible electricity and natural gas bills should be deposited in the fund; and whether new charges should be imposed to fund new or expanded social programs. (cf: P.L.2019, c.362, c.13) 12.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill creates a Clean Energy Technology Center (center) within the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to administer an Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund (trust fund). Under the bill, the center is authorized to use trust fund financing to finance clean energy technology research and provide loans and loan guarantees to companies, institutions of higher education, and nonprofits to encourage the creation of clean energy technology ventures and the training of workers to perform associated green jobs. The bill specifically authorizes the center to provide loans and loan guarantees from the trust fund to:  (1) stimulate increased financing for the expansion of clean energy research and development facilities by leveraging private financing and providing related financing, including financing for construction and expansion; (2) provide financing to State institutions of higher education to develop a curriculum relative to clean energy and clean energy technology; (3) make targeted investments in clean energy research and promote manufacturing activities for new and existing advanced clean energy technologies; (4) make financing available to institutions of higher education, businesses, and other institutions to encourage the federal government, industry, and other entities to provide funding; (5) provide bridge financing in anticipation of such awards; and (6) fund programs and investments that promote economic self-sufficiency for low and moderate income communities in the clean energy industry. Financing by the center from the trust fund is to be governed by rules to be approved by the board of directors of the center established under the bill.  The bill provides that the 10-member board is to include representatives of government, educational institutions, and private industry, including an engineer or scientist, a chief executive officer of a New Jersey-based clean energy corporation, a representative of electric public utility ratepayers, and a venture capitalist with expertise in clean energy technologies. The bill also authorizes a study of the clean energy sector, to examine the sectors future workforce needs and its growth rate and levels of private investment, real property owned by the State available and suitable for the installation and operation of renewable energy facilities, energy efficiency opportunities on real property owned by the State, and the future funding requirements of the center. The trust fund created by the bill would be financed with revenues received from the societal benefits charge established pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) (i.e., the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act) and is intended to stimulate the growth of the States clean energy economy.  The bill would authorize the center to use revenues to finance:  (1) if the center so chooses, a Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Institute, to serve as a joint venture among institutions of higher education in the State and to provide a focal point for research, education, and commercialization activities in the hydrogen fuel cell sector; (2) if the center so chooses, an Entrepreneurial Fellowship Program, which would provide loans or loan guarantees to entrepreneurs from business sectors other than clean energy sectors to enroll in programs to foster knowledge and expertise of clean energy technology; (3) a loan program for clean energy companies, institutions, or nonprofit organizations; (4) a workforce development program to provide loans and loan guarantees to institutions of higher education, vocational-technical schools, or community-based organizations with existing or potential workforce development programs in clean energy; and (5) a Pathways Out of Poverty Initiative to provide loans and loan guarantees to clean energy companies, community-based nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, or labor organizations for training programs that lead to economic self-sufficiency.

The board may subsequently order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the board chooses to modify the program; (2)   Nuclear plant decommissioning costs; (3)   The costs of demand side management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment, and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for energy efficiency , plug-in electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and Class I renewable energy programs that provide environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al..), and provided that 25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells. The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer period of time. The board shall make these determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding; (4)   Manufactured gas plant remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent with mechanisms in the remediation adjustment clauses for the electric public utility and gas public utility adopted by the board; [and] (5)   The cost, of consumer education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that, together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-79), shall be sufficient to fund the consumer education program established pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-85) ; and (6)   100 percent of the costs of the operation of the Clean Energy Technology Center and the Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund, established pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The board may order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect the inclusion of funding for the Clean Energy Technology Center and the Alternative and Clean Energy Investment Trust Fund. b.    There is established in the Board of Public Utilities a nonlapsing fund to be known as the "Universal Service Fund."  The board shall determine: the level of funding and the appropriate administration of the fund; the purposes and programs to be funded with monies from the fund; which social programs shall be provided by an electric public utility as part of the provision of its regulated services which provide a public benefit; whether the funds appropriated to fund the "Lifeline Credit Program" established pursuant to P.L.1979, c.197 (C.48:2-29.15 et seq.), the "Tenants' Lifeline Assistance Program" established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.210 (C.48:2-29.31 et seq.), the funds received pursuant to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.8621 et seq., and funds collected by electric and natural gas utilities, as authorized by the board, to offset uncollectible electricity and natural gas bills should be deposited in the fund; and whether new charges should be imposed to fund new or expanded social programs. (cf: P.L.2019, c.362, c.13) 12.    This act shall take effect immediately.
