The bill, further, amends and expands the definition of "official advertising," and applies the definition to other related terms as specified in the bill. In cases where there is no qualified newspaper or online news publication, the State or local body (excluding a city) may publish  each official advertisement that it is required to publish in at least one newspaper or online news publication that meets the requirements set forth in R.S.35:1-2.2, so long as the newspaper or online news publication maintains its designated publication address within the county in which the municipality is located for a period of not less than two consecutive years immediately preceding publication of its first official advertisement. The bill establishes rates for publishing official advertising for newspapers and online news publications based on the number of bona fide net paid subscribers.
