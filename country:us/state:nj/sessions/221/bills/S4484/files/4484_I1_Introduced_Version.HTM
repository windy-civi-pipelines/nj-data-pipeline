c.231 (C.10:4-8) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    &quot;Public body&quot;
means a commission, authority, board, council, committee or any other group of
two or more persons organized under the laws of this State, and collectively
empowered as a voting body to perform a public governmental function affecting
the rights, duties, obligations, privileges, benefits, or other legal relations
of any person, or collectively authorized to spend public funds including the
Legislature, but does not mean or include the judicial branch of the
government, any grand or petit jury, any parole board or any agency or body
acting in a parole capacity, the State Commission of Investigation, the
Apportionment Commission established under Article IV, Section III, of the
Constitution, or any political party committee organized under Title 19 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    &quot;Meeting&quot;
means and includes any gathering whether corporeal or by means of communication
equipment, which is attended by, or open to, all of the members of a public
body, held with the intent, on the part of the members of the body present, to
discuss or act as a unit upon the specific public business of that body. 
Meeting does not mean or include any such gathering (1) attended by less than
an effective majority of the members of a public body, or (2) attended by or
open to all the members of three or more similar public bodies at a convention
or similar gathering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    &quot;Public
business&quot; means and includes all matters which relate in any way, directly
or indirectly, to the performance of the public body's functions or the conduct
of its business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    &quot;Adequate
notice&quot;  means written advance notice of at least 48 hours, giving the
time, date, location and, to the extent known, the agenda of any regular,
special or rescheduled meeting, which notice shall accurately state whether
formal action may or may not be taken and which shall be (1) prominently posted
in at least one public place reserved for such or similar announcements, (2) <u>physically</u>
mailed, <u>electronically mailed,</u> telephoned, telegrammed, or hand
delivered to at least two newspapers<u>, including newspapers published in part
or in whole electronically on the Internet or an online news publication,</u>
which newspapers shall be designated by the public body to receive such notices
because they have the greatest likelihood of informing the public within the
area of jurisdiction of the public body of such meetings, one of which shall be
the official newspaper, where any such has been designated by the public body
or if the public body has failed to so designate, where any has been designated
by the governing body of the political subdivision whose geographic boundaries
are coextensive with that of the public body and (3) filed with the clerk of the
municipality when the public body's geographic boundaries are coextensive with
that of a single municipality, with the clerk of the county when the public
body's geographic boundaries are coextensive with that of a single county, and
with the Secretary of State if the public body has Statewide jurisdiction.  For
any other public body the filing shall be with the clerk or chief
administrative officer of such other public body and each municipal or county
clerk of each municipality or county encompassed within the jurisdiction of
such public body.  Where annual notice or revisions thereof in compliance with
section 13 of this act set forth the location of any meeting, no further notice
shall be required for such meeting.</p>
