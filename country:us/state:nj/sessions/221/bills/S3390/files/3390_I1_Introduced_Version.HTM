The bill provides that a licensee of the New Jersey Real Estate Commission, acting as an agent of the owner, is not to be liable for information that is required to be disclosed by an owner, but was not provided to the licensee. This bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs to adopt rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill on or before January 1, 2025.  The bill would take effect on January 1, 2025.
