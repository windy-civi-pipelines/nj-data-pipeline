<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 5 of P.L.1996, c.138
(C.18A:7F-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As used in this section,
&quot;cost of living&quot; means the CPI as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Within 30 days
following the approval of the Educational Adequacy Report, the commissioner
shall notify each district of the base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts
for full-day preschool, the weights for grade level, county vocational school
districts, at-risk pupils, bilingual pupils, and combination pupils, the cost
coefficients for security aid and for transportation aid, the State average
classification rate and the excess cost for general special education services
pupils, the State average classification rate and the excess cost for
speech-only pupils, and the geographic cost adjustment for each of the school
years to which the report is applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Annually, within two days
following the transmittal of the State budget message to the Legislature by the
Governor pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-20), the commissioner
shall notify each district of the maximum amount of aid payable to the district
in the succeeding school year pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et al.), and shall notify each district of the district's adequacy
budget for the succeeding school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the 2008-2009 school year
and thereafter, unless otherwise specified within P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.), aid amounts payable for the budget year shall be based on budget year
pupil counts, which shall be projected by the commissioner using data from
prior years.  Adjustments for the actual pupil counts of the budget year shall
be made to State aid amounts payable during the school year succeeding the
budget year.  Additional amounts payable shall be reflected as revenue and an
account receivable for the budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, each district's State aid payable for
the 2008-2009 school year, with the exception of aid for school facilities
projects, shall be based on simulations employing the various formulas and
State aid amounts contained in P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).  The
commissioner shall prepare a report dated December 12, 2007 reflecting the
State aid amounts payable by category for each district and shall submit the
report to the Legislature prior to the adoption of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.).  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection and
paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-47),
the amounts contained in the commissioner's report shall be the final amounts
payable and shall not be subsequently adjusted other than to reflect the
phase-in of the required general fund local levy pursuant to paragraph (4) of
subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58) and to reflect
school choice aid to which a district may be entitled pursuant to section 20 of
that act. The projected pupil counts and equalized valuations used for the
calculation of State aid shall also be used for the calculation of adequacy
budget, local share, and required local share.  For 2008-2009, extraordinary
special education State aid shall be included as a projected amount in the
commissioner's report dated December 12, 2007 pending the final approval of
applications for the aid.  If the actual award of extraordinary special
education State aid is greater than the projected amount, the district shall
receive the increase in the aid payable in the subsequent school year pursuant
to the provisions of subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-55).  If the actual award of extraordinary special education State
aid is less than the projected amount, other State aid categories shall be
adjusted accordingly so that the district shall not receive less State aid than
as provided in accordance with the provisions of sections 5 and 16 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-47 and C.18A:7F-58).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that the
commissioner determines, following the enactment of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et al.) but prior to the issuance of State aid notices for the
2008-2009 school year, that a significant district-specific change in data
warrants an increase in State aid for that district, the commissioner may
adjust the State aid amount provided for the district in the December 12, 2007
report to reflect the increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Each district shall have
a required local share.  For districts that receive educational adequacy aid
pursuant to subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58), the
required local share shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of
that subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For all other districts, the
required local share shall equal the lesser of the local share calculated at
the district's adequacy budget pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-51), or the district's budgeted local share for the prebudget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to meet this
requirement, each district shall raise a general fund tax levy which equals its
required local share.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No municipal governing body or
bodies or board of school estimate, as appropriate, shall certify a general
fund tax levy which does not meet the required local share provisions of this

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides a tax levy
cap adjustment for certain school districts that are experiencing State school
aid reductions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a school
district is generally prohibited from increasing its property tax levy by more
than two percent compared to the previous school year.  This limited increase
is often referred to as a tax levy growth limitation or a property tax
cap.  However, State law authorizes certain allowable adjustments to the
general two percent limitation, thereby permitting a district to account for
certain increases in items such as enrollment, health care costs, and certain normal
and accrued liability pension contributions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide for an
allowable adjustment to the tax levy growth limitation for a school district
that experiences a reduction in State school aid in the 2023-2024 school year
or the 2024-2025 school year pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2018, c.67,
which is commonly referred to as S2.  The amount of the allowable adjustment
equals the difference between the amount of State aid received by the school
district in the previous school year and the amount of State aid received by
the school district in the 2023-2024 school year or the 2024-2025 school year. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would provide for
another allowable adjustment for a school district that is experiencing a
reduction in State school aid and is spending below adequacy in any school year
after the 2024-2025 school year.  Under current law, a school district is
considered to be spending below adequacy if its prebudget year spending
(defined as the sum from the prior school year of equalization aid, special
education categorical aid, security categorical aid, and the school districts
tax levy) is below its projected adequacy spending (defined as the sum for the
school year in which the budget will be implemented of its adequacy budget,
special education categorical aid, and security categorical aid).  For these
districts, the allowable adjustment to the tax levy would be the amount
necessary for the district to be spending at adequacy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill prohibits
any school district that increases its tax levy using the allowable adjustments
established by the bill from reducing its teacher workforce or decreasing
appropriations for instruction or support services.  However, a district may reduce
either its total number of teachers or the total amount of general fund
appropriations for instruction or support services if the Commissioner of
Education approves the applicable reductions in the districts proposed budget.</p>
