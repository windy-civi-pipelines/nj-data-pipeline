<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
establishing procedures and standards with respect to certain privatization
contracts and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New
  Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Using private
contractors to provide public services formerly provided by public employees
does not always promote the public interest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Decisions to use private
contractors to provide public services must be based on factors which promote
the public interest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     To ensure that citizens
of the State receive high quality public services at low cost, with due regard
for the taxpayers of the State and the needs of public and private workers, it
is necessary to regulate privatization contracts for public services and to
require a thorough review and analysis of potential cost impacts prior to entering
into any such privatization contract; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is appropriate to
require that cost savings of the contract to the State be substantial and
significant because of the hazard that the use of private contractors to
provide services may prove, in the long term, to be less efficient or more
expensive than expected when the contracting commences, and the ability of an
agency to resume the public provision of services under those circumstances may
be hindered by factors such as the divestment of equipment and capital and the
loss of experienced, highly qualified personnel in connection with the
contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      2.   As
used in this act:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Agency
means any department, division, board, commission or other office or officer of
the State or of any political subdivision of the State, or any authority or
other instrumentality of the State.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Employee
benefits means all benefits provided to employees, including, but not limited
to, pensions, paid time off and health insurance plans, including coverage
provided under those plans to the employee, the employee's spouse and dependent
children.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Local
agency means any department, division, board, commission or other office or
officer of any political subdivision of the State.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Privatization
contract or contract means an agreement or combination or series of
agreements valued at a total of $500,000 or more, if an agency is a local
agency, or $1,000,000 or more if the agency is not a local agency, by which a
non-governmental person or entity agrees with the agency to provide services
which are substantially similar to, and in lieu of, services previously
provided, in whole or in part, by regular employees of the agency which results
in a loss of employment for the regular employees, except that none of the
following shall be considered a privatization contract:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (1)
any agreement solely to provide legal, management consulting, planning,
engineering or design services; </span></p>

any contract solely for public work subject to the prevailing wage requirements
of P.L.1963, c. 150 (C.34:11-56.25 et  seq.<span style='color:black'>)</span>;<span
style='color:black'> </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;

any contract under which a vendor provides services during an emergency or
