<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The board;
appointment; terms. In addition to the members appointed to represent the
interests of the public pursuant to P.L.1971, c.60 (C.45:1-2.1 et seq.), the
New Jersey Board of Nursing shall consist of 12 members, six of whom shall be

In making appointments the Governor shall give due consideration to, but shall
not be bound by, recommendations submitted by the various nurses' professional
associations of this State.  Upon notice and hearing, the Governor may remove

license to practice practical nursing in this State; shall have had at least
three years' experience in practical nursing; and shall at the time of appointment

take, subscribe and file in the office of the Secretary of State the oath or
affirmation prescribed by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Duties and powers.  The
board shall have the following duties and powers: (1) It shall hold annual
meetings and such other meetings as it may deem necessary at such times and places
as the board shall prescribe and a majority of the board including one officer
shall constitute a quorum.  (2) It shall elect from its members and prescribe
the duties of a president and secretary-treasurer, each of whom shall serve for
one year and until a successor is elected.  (3) It shall appoint and prescribe
the duties of an executive secretary to the board who need not be a member
thereof but who shall be a citizen of the United States, a graduate of a
college or university with a major in nursing education, a registered nurse of
this State with at least five years' experience in teaching or administration
or both in an accredited school of professional nursing, or have equivalent
qualifications as determined by the board. The executive secretary shall hold
office during the will and pleasure of the board.  (4) It shall employ and
prescribe the duties of such persons as in its judgment shall be necessary for
the proper performance and execution of the duties and powers of the board. 
(5) It shall determine and pay reasonable compensation and necessary expenses
of the executive secretary and all employees of the board.  (6) It shall pay to
each member of the board the compensation hereinafter provided.  (7) It shall
have a common seal, keep an official record of all its meetings, and through
its secretary-treasurer report annually to the Governor the work of the board.
(8) It shall examine applicants for a license or renewals thereof, issue,
renew, revoke and suspend licenses, as hereinafter provided.  (9) It shall in
its discretion investigate and prosecute all violations of provisions of this
act.  (10) It shall keep an official record which shall show the name, age,
nativity and permanent place of residence of each applicant and licensee and
such further information concerning each applicant and licensee as the board
shall deem advisable.  The record shall show also whether the applicant was
examined, licensed or rejected under this and any prior act.  Copies of any of
the entries of the record or of any certificate issued by the board may be
authenticated by any member of the board under its seal and when so
authenticated shall be evidence in all courts of this State of the same weight
and force as the original thereof.  For authenticating a copy of any entry or
entries contained in its record the board shall be paid a fee of $3.00, but
such authentication, if made at the request of any public agency of this or any
other jurisdiction, may be without fee. (11) In its discretion it may publish

and curricula for schools of nursing and evaluate and approve courses for
affiliation. (13) It shall hear and determine applications for accreditation of
schools of professional nursing, conduct investigations before and after
accreditation of such schools and institutions with which they are affiliated,
and issue, suspend or revoke certificates of accreditation as hereinafter
provided.  (14) It shall approve schools of practical nursing which shall
conform to the standards, curricula, and requirements prescribed by the board,
and suspend or revoke approval for violations thereof; provided, that this
power shall not extend to schools operated by any board of education in this
State.  (15) It may consult with the Medical Society of New Jersey and the New
Jersey Hospital Association with respect to any matter relating to the
administration of this act and shall consult with those associations with
respect to standards and curricula and any change thereof for schools of
nursing.  (16) It shall issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and

and any member of the board shall administer an oath or affirmation to persons
appearing to give testimony at such hearings.  (17) It may conduct any
investigations, studies of nursing and nursing education and related matters,
and prepare and issue such publications as in the judgment of the board will
advance the profession of nursing and its service to the public. (18) It shall
perform all other functions which are provided in this act to be performed by
it or which in the judgment of the board are necessary or proper for the

(22) It shall establish and maintain a registry of all individuals who have

of information about the disqualification of any person from certification as a
homemaker-home health aide pursuant to sections 7 through 13 of P.L.1997, c.100
(C.45:11-24.3 through 24.9), including the specific documented findings
constituting the basis for that disqualification; except that the information
shall indicate that the person was convicted of a crime or disorderly persons
offense as described in section 7 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.45:11-24.3), but shall
not identify the conviction or convictions which constitute the basis for the

and shall further prescribe standards establishing the criteria for determining
those tasks which registered professional nurses may delegate to unlicensed
assistive personnel working under their supervision and the type of supervision
required with respect to those personnel. (26) It shall prescribe standards and
requirements for unlicensed assistive personnel, including initial education
and continuing education and a competency evaluation program, which these

personnel&quot; means any unlicensed or uncertified personnel employed by a
licensed health care facility that perform nursing tasks which do not require
the skill or judgment of a registered professional nurse and which are assigned
to them by, and carried out under the supervision of, a registered professional
nurse.  (27) It may require licensees to meet continuing education requirements
as a condition of relicensure.</p>
