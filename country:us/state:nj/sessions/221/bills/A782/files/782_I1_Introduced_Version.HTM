<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In <u>State</u> v. <u>Sumulikoski
and Sopel</u>, 221 N.J. 93 (decided March 18, 2015), the New Jersey Supreme
Court ruled that the State did not have territorial jurisdiction to prosecute
two employees of a New Jersey high school for unlawful sexual conduct with
three New Jersey students that took place in Germany.  The employees, a teacher
and a school administrator, had been chaperoning the students on a
school-sponsored trip. The defendants were indicted in Bergen County
for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, but the court
dismissed the charges on jurisdictional grounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, set out in
N.J.S.2C:1-3, a person may be convicted of an offense under the law of this

which is such an element occurs within this State. In <u>Sumulikoski</u>, the
court held that no such conduct had taken place in New Jersey because the
offense did not take place in New Jersey. The court ruled that, although the
defendants did take on their status as chaperones for the students in New
  Jersey, such status was insufficient for jurisdiction. </p>

N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of supervisory or disciplinary power in this State
over the victim pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of subsection c.
of N.J.S.2C:14-2 would be considered conduct which is a material element of the
offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends
N.J.S.2C:24-4, endangering the welfare of a child, to provide that for purposes
of determining territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (a) of
paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of
responsibility in this State for the care of a child would be considered
conduct which is a material element of the offense.</p>
