In a prosecution under sub-subparagraph (iii) of this subparagraph, the State shall not be required to offer proof that an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child had actually been searched, copied, transmitted or viewed by another user of the file-sharing program, or by any other person, and it shall be no defense that the defendant did not intend to distribute the item to another user of the file-sharing program or to any other person.

For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "possess" includes receiving, viewing, or having under one's control, through any means, including the Internet.

(iii)  A person commits a crime of the third degree if he knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under his control, through any means, including the Internet, less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, in any instance where a person was convicted of an offense under this subparagraph that involved 100 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subparagraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for the offense set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (6)   For purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 18 in any photograph, film, videotape, computer program or file, video game, or any other reproduction or reconstruction shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 18.  If the child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. (7)   For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item. For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations.  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. (cf: P.L.2017, c.141, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow prosecutions for certain criminal conduct that takes place outside of New Jersey. In State v. Sumulikoski and Sopel, 221 N.J. 93 (decided March 18, 2015), the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the State did not have territorial jurisdiction to prosecute two employees of a New Jersey high school for unlawful sexual conduct with three New Jersey students that took place in Germany.  The employees, a teacher and a school administrator, had been chaperoning the students on a school-sponsored trip. The defendants were indicted in Bergen County for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, but the court dismissed the charges on jurisdictional grounds. Under current law, set out in N.J.S.2C:1-3, a person may be convicted of an offense under the law of this State if either the conduct which is an element of the offense or the result which is such an element occurs within this State. In Sumulikoski, the court held that no such conduct had taken place in New Jersey because the offense did not take place in New Jersey. The court ruled that, although the defendants did take on their status as chaperones for the students in New Jersey, such status was insufficient for jurisdiction. This bill would address the courts decision by amending the statutes governing sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child to provide that the status of a defendant would constitute grounds for New Jersey jurisdiction under certain circumstances. The bill amends N.J.S.2C:14-2, sexual assault, to provide that for the purposes of determining territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of supervisory or disciplinary power in this State over the victim pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:14-2 would be considered conduct which is a material element of the offense. The bill also amends N.J.S.2C:24-4, endangering the welfare of a child, to provide that for purposes of determining territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of responsibility in this State for the care of a child would be considered conduct which is a material element of the offense.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person whose offense under this subparagraph involved 1,000 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, which shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by the court or 10 years, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subparagraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term "possess" includes receiving, viewing, or having under one's control, through any means, including the Internet. (b) (i) A person commits a crime of the first degree if he knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under his control, through any means, including the Internet, 100,000 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. (ii)   A person commits a crime of the second degree if he knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under his control, through any means, including the Internet, at least 1,000 but less than 100,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. (iii)  A person commits a crime of the third degree if he knowingly possesses, knowingly views, or knowingly has under his control, through any means, including the Internet, less than 1,000 items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, in any instance where a person was convicted of an offense under this subparagraph that involved 100 or more items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child, the court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment unless, having regard to the character and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that imprisonment would be a serious injustice which overrides the need to deter such conduct by others. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:43-6, a person convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this subparagraph shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment as set forth in N.J.S.2C:43-7. For the purposes of this subparagraph, an offense is considered a second or subsequent offense if the actor has at any time been convicted pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, or under any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for an offense that is substantially equivalent to paragraph (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to preclude or limit any prosecution or conviction for the offense set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph. (6)   For purposes of this subsection, a person who is depicted as or presents the appearance of being under the age of 18 in any photograph, film, videotape, computer program or file, video game, or any other reproduction or reconstruction shall be rebuttably presumed to be under the age of 18.  If the child who is depicted as engaging in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the age of 18, the actor shall be strictly liable and it shall not be a defense that the actor did not know that the child was under the age of 18, nor shall it be a defense that the actor believed that the child was 18 years of age or older, even if such a mistaken belief was reasonable. (7)   For aggregation purposes, each depiction of the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item, provided that each depiction that is in the form of a photograph, picture, image, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be one item and each depiction that is in the form of a film, video, video-clip, movie, or visual depiction of a similar nature shall be considered to be 10 separate items, and each individual act of distribution of an item depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child shall be considered a separate item. For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the act or acts constituting the violation occurred at the same time or at different times and, with respect to distribution, whether the act or acts of distribution were to the same person or several persons or occurred at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations.  For purposes of determining the number of items depicting the sexual exploitation or abuse of a child for purposes of sentencing pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (5) of this subsection, the court shall aggregate all items involved, whether the possession of such items occurred at the same time or at different times, provided that each individual act was committed within the applicable statute of limitations. (cf: P.L.2017, c.141, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow prosecutions for certain criminal conduct that takes place outside of New Jersey. In State v. Sumulikoski and Sopel, 221 N.J. 93 (decided March 18, 2015), the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the State did not have territorial jurisdiction to prosecute two employees of a New Jersey high school for unlawful sexual conduct with three New Jersey students that took place in Germany.  The employees, a teacher and a school administrator, had been chaperoning the students on a school-sponsored trip. The defendants were indicted in Bergen County for sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, but the court dismissed the charges on jurisdictional grounds. Under current law, set out in N.J.S.2C:1-3, a person may be convicted of an offense under the law of this State if either the conduct which is an element of the offense or the result which is such an element occurs within this State. In Sumulikoski, the court held that no such conduct had taken place in New Jersey because the offense did not take place in New Jersey. The court ruled that, although the defendants did take on their status as chaperones for the students in New Jersey, such status was insufficient for jurisdiction. This bill would address the courts decision by amending the statutes governing sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child to provide that the status of a defendant would constitute grounds for New Jersey jurisdiction under certain circumstances. The bill amends N.J.S.2C:14-2, sexual assault, to provide that for the purposes of determining territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of supervisory or disciplinary power in this State over the victim pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:14-2 would be considered conduct which is a material element of the offense. The bill also amends N.J.S.2C:24-4, endangering the welfare of a child, to provide that for purposes of determining territorial jurisdiction pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:1-3, the assumption of responsibility in this State for the care of a child would be considered conduct which is a material element of the offense.
