Under the bill, the Palisades Interstate Park Commission and the Department of Transportation may enter into a written contract to effectuate the requirements of the bill.  However, this contract may allow the commission to conduct all or some activities related to the improvement or operations and maintenance of the Palisades Interstate Parkway, provided that the department makes payments to the commission to support the full costs of such activities.
