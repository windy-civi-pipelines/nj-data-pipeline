<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Female Inmates Rights Protection Act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of this
bill, the Commissioner of Corrections is required to ensure that any prohibited
acts that subject an inmate to disciplinary actions or sanctions are gender
appropriate and is required to establish separate prohibited acts for male and
female inmates.  In addition, the bill requires the commissioner to implement
gender appropriate disciplinary actions and sanctions for any prohibited acts
committed by an inmate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, the bill requires the
commissioner to annually submit a report to the Legislature providing a summary
of all disciplinary actions and sanctions imposed on inmates, which is to
contain each inmates gender. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the commissioner
is required to institute mandatory in-service training for every correctional
police officer assigned to the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women
regarding gender responsive policies.  The commissioner is to ensure that every
newly appointed correctional police officer completes the training upon
assignment to the facility and every correctional police officer currently
assigned to the facility completes the training within two years of the bills
effective date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also requires the
commissioner to establish a nursery program allowing newborn children to remain
with their incarcerated mothers if the female inmate gave birth to the child
while incarcerated in a State correctional facility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an inmate is
not eligible to participate in the program if: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the inmate has been
previously convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, or is currently serving a
sentence imposed for any crime enumerated under the No Early Release Act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) a search conducted by the

warrants; </p>

that is considered to be the most serious and results in the most severe
sanctions, within the previous two years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) the inmate has been
previously convicted of, adjudicated delinquent for, or is currently serving a
sentence imposed for a crime committed against a person under the age of 16; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) there is evidence of the
use of a controlled dangerous substance during the inmates pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An inmate that is eligible to
participate in the program is to be transferred to a residential community
release program while participating in the program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unless there is a court order
regarding child custody providing otherwise, a child in the program is to
remain in the residential community release program until the child is two
years of age or until the inmate is released, whichever occurs sooner.  In
addition, the commissioner is required to provide accommodations for parenting
time with the childs other parent as agreed upon by the inmate and the childs
other parent or in accordance with a court order.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is also
required to provide support services for female inmates participating in the
program, including parenting classes. The inmate is required to participate in
all available prenatal and parenting classes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, prior to being
admitted into the program, an inmate is required to submit to a mental health
evaluation by a psychologist or psychiatrist licensed in New Jersey, who, based
upon the evaluation, is to make a recommendation to the commissioner regarding
the inmates participation in the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
commissioner to provide doula services to pregnant inmates.  A person providing
doula services is to be permitted to attend and provide assistance during labor
and childbirth.  In addition, the bill requires the commissioner to allow an
inmate to have a support person present during labor and childbirth. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines doula
services as services provided by a trained doula for physical, emotional, or
informational support to a pregnant woman before, during, and after the
delivery of a child, including, but not limited to, support and assistance
during labor and childbirth, prenatal and postpartum education, breastfeeding
assistance, parenting education, and support in the event that an inmate has
been or will become separated from the inmates child.</p>
