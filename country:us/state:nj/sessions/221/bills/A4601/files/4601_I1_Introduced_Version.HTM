<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning insurance coverage for reproductive
health care and revising and supplementing various parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Given the historic and
continued attacks on abortion access and reproductive health care at the
federal level and in other states, it is critical that New Jersey take
legislative action to ensure that all individuals in the State are able to
exercise their fundamental rights to choose to use or refuse contraception or
sterilization, to carry a pregnancy, to give birth, or to have an abortion,
regardless of where the they are domiciled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    New Jersey<span
class=normaltextrun> has historically provided stronger protections for
reproductive rights and autonomy than are provided by other states and the
federal government.  The New Jersey Supreme Court has made clear through
several holdings, including <i>Right to Choose v. Byrne</i>, 91 N.J. 287
(1982), and <i>Planned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer</i>, 165 N.J. 609
(2000), that Article I, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution protects the
right to abortion and reproductive autonomy to an extent that exceeds the
protections established under the United States Constitution.  In 2022, New
Jersey codified the fundamental constitutional right to reproductive autonomy,
including the right to abortion, <a name="_Hlk162443170">and has restored and
allocated State funding to support reproductive health care services</a>.</span><span
class=eop>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The <span
class=normaltextrun>Legislature is committed to ensuring that all individuals
in the State can fully exercise their right to reproductive autonomy and can
access affordable and timely reproductive health care services.  It is
imperative to ensure that every person present in the State has the freedom to
choose whether, when, and how to bear children on their own terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    <span
class=normaltextrun><span style='color:black'>Access to reproductive health
care is critical for the health and economic security of all people in New
Jersey, providing all individuals in the State with the opportunity</span> to
lead healthier and more productive lives. <span style='color:#212121'>To
effectively vindicate the right to abortion and reproductive autonomy enshrined
in State law, New Jersey must address barriers to access.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=normaltextrun><span
style='color:#212121'>     </span></span>e.    <span class=normaltextrun>Financial
barriers and costs associated with reproductive health care services can
prevent people from accessing appropriate and necessary care.&nbsp; These costs
can threaten individuals financial security and negatively impact their
long-term economic prospects. Cost barriers associated with reproductive health
care often have a disparate impact on people who already experience barriers to
health care access, including young people, people of color, people with
disabilities, people with a low income, people living in rural areas,
immigrants, and transgender or non-binary individuals.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=normaltextrun>     </span>f.     A
<span class=normaltextrun>person's income level or their type of insurance
should never prevent them from having access to a full range of reproductive
health care.  The absence of funding should never be a reason that someone
present in New Jersey does not exercise their fundamental right to reproductive
autonomy, including abortion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=normaltextrun>     g.    Health
care practitioners should not be constrained from providing necessary or
appropriate reproductive health care. Medically unnecessary regulations
discourage practitioners from offering reproductive health care, including
abortions, which effectively reduces the number of licensed providers,
diminishes the availability of legal abortion providers, and creates harmful
barriers and delays to care without providing any benefit to patients.
Extensive scientific study has shown that abortion care is a safe medical
intervention, safer than childbirth as well as many common medical procedures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=normaltextrun>     h.    Given
New Jerseys high priority to the preservation of health, the State has a
significant interest in ensuring that every person in New Jersey can access
reproductive health care, including abortion services.  The Legislature is
committed to addressing barriers to receiving and providing reproductive health
care in the State.  It shall therefore be the policy of this State to enable
all qualified health care practitioners to provide abortion services in the
State, and to advance insurance coverage and other methods through which to
ensure that reproductive health care is accessible and affordable to all people
present in New Jersey.</span><span class=eop>&nbsp;</span>     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) As used in
this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Abortion means any medical
treatment intended to induce the termination of a pregnancy and services
rendered to facilitate the termination which may include follow-up care, except
for the purpose of producing a live birth.  Abortion includes, but is not
limited to, aspiration abortion and medication abortion, as defined in this
section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Aspiration abortion means a
procedure that terminates a pregnancy utilizing manual or electric suction to
empty the uterus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Carrier means an insurance
company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation, medical
service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to issue
health benefits plans in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Covered person means a
person, or dependents of a person, on whose behalf a carrier offering the plan
is obligated to pay benefits or provide services pursuant to the health
