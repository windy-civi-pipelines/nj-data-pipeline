<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
revisions to the New Jersey Money Transmitters Act to require licensed money transmitters
and their delegates to provide more reporting, record keeping and consumer
disclosures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires licensees to
prominently display license information at their locations. The bill broadens
the consent deemed to be given by licensees and delegates to include record
inspection rights for appropriate law enforcement representatives in addition
to the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and requires licensees to keep
records for five years instead of the three years required by the current act.
The bill requires licensees to file quarterly reports with the commissioner, in
addition to the annual reports presently required, and raises the penalty to
$200 per day, from not more than $100 per day, as to any licensee who fails to
file any report. The licensee shall also file annually with the commissioner, a
copy of the licensee's most recent registration with the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter business pursuant to 31
C.F.R. s.1010.100 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill expands the liability
of licensees for certain acts of their delegates and provides for license
suspension upon conviction for certain crimes. The bill also requires a
delegate to prominently display at each of its locations a notice indicating
that the delegate is an authorized delegate of a licensee. Further, the bill
mandates that the department maintain a website to make licensee and delegate
information available to the public. Finally, the bill increases the crime of
operating as a money transmitter without a license from a crime of the third
degree to a crime of the second degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that funds
belonging to a licensee and deposited in a financial institution shall not
constitute trust funds, unless the financial institution has actual knowledge
that such funds are owned by or belong to the licensee. The bill also provides
that the licensee is liable to a purchaser or holder of an outstanding payment
instrument which is issued by the licensee or received by the licensees
authorized delegate for transmission and set-off by the financial institution. 
If the licensee has insufficient assets to make the purchaser or holder whole,
the purchaser or holder will be entitled to reimbursement under the surety bond
that the act currently requires all licensees to have.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes technical
corrections.</p>
