Under the bill, the task force is to hold three public hearings, one hearing in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the State.  Finally, the bill requires the task force to issue a report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor and the Legislature within one year of the bills effective date. According to the Sentencing Project, in every state, black youth are more likely to be incarcerated than their white peers.  New Jersey has the highest black-white disparity in youth incarceration with black youth being more than 20 times more likely than their white peers to be incarcerated.  In addition, according to the Youth Justice Task Force Report, despite dramatic overall reductions in the number of youth detained, efforts to eliminate disproportionate minority representation in detention have not been as successful, and troubling inequities continue to characterize this State. Further, as noted in the Youth Justice Task Force Report, as known from brain science, adolescence continues into the mid-20s.  Therefore, this is a time of significant growth and maturation and presents a critical opportunity for redirection.
