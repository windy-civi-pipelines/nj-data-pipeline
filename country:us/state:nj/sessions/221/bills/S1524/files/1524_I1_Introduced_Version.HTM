<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.     (New section)  This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Owners Rights and Obligations in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Homeowners
associations formed to manage property shared by all homeowners, whether that
property be in condominiums, planned communities, or cooperatives, function as
quasi-governments, often providing services in lieu of governmental services,
levying assessments and imposing fines, and, through their control of
maintenance and assessment levels, rulemaking powers, and enforcement efforts,
have substantial power to affect both the quality of life and financial health
of the individual homeowners comprising their membership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Current statutes are
ineffective to compel homeowners' associations to treat fairly the owners of
homes in planned communities or the holders of proprietary leases in
cooperatives, in the manner of fair treatment required for condominium owners. 
The Condominium Act, P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.) requires developers
and associations to clearly recognize the coexisting interests of each
individual homeowner in the commonly-owned facilities of a condominium, by
requiring the consent of a majority of the owners prior to making changes in
the governing documents.  That act also provides quasi-governmental powers to
condominium boards to impose fines on members, and to place liens on their
individual homes.  Similar protections and powers have not been enunciated in
the statutes for owners of homes or holders of proprietary leases in planned
communities and cooperatives, respectively.  The Legislature attempted to
expand the law to apply to all types of homeowners association through the enactment
of P.L.1993, c.30, but that act has proven ineffective in making sure that
owners in all types of these communities are treated fairly and democratically
by their governing boards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The unilateral manner
in which a developer is permitted under the law to make all decisions for an
association until a certain level of sales of homes have been reached may serve
to protect the developers investment in the community while he is selling, but
does not serve an association well when it is required to act as a governing
board and operate in a democratic and fair manner, and in the best interests of
all of the owners as required by statute.  While protecting the interests of
both, there is a need to clearly separate in the law (1) the interests and role
of a developer of a shared ownership community from (2) the interests and role
of the association formed to represent the collective shared property interests
of owners of individual properties within such communities, and (3) a need to
provide standards to association governing boards to foster transparent
governance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There is a further need
to update New Jerseys laws to provide improved, relevant disclosure to a
prospective purchaser as to the exact nature of what is being purchased, and a
clear statement of their rights and responsibilities as a member of a
homeowners association.  There is a need to standardize certain information,
and to allow developers to submit it in an electronic format for an expedited
review by the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     There is a need to
eliminate exemptions from required disclosures by developers to purchasers in
smaller shared ownership communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In order to minimize
State involvement in the affairs of homeowners associations, and in order to
reduce the need for litigation by members of associations, there is a need to
create a truly objective, reliable, and low cost system of dispute resolution
for shared ownership communities which will be overseen and provided by
experienced neutral parties, with adequate due process protections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    There is a need to
foster democratic governance in community associations in the following areas,
including, but not limited to, the regulation of elections, budget adoption,
access to association records, open meetings, education of owners and governing
board members, and to raise awareness of the rights and obligations of owners
and those owners serving their communities as governing board members.  The
Legislature declares that it is necessary and in the public interest to
establish an independent Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, comprised
of individuals living in and providing services to such communities, to
function as a State liaison for such communities.  The commission will promote
an equitable balance between the interests of association governing boards,
developers, owners, and residents in these communities, through the provision
of information and the establishment of governance standards for such
associations, and will serve as a coordinating entity for the provision of alternative
dispute resolution services and enforcement of statutory rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It has been more than 40 years
since the Legislature enacted &quot;The Planned Real Estate Development Full
Disclosure Act,&quot; (PREDFDA), P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.) to
provide State oversight of the marketing of planned developments to prospective
purchasers, through a review of documents and advertisements, as well as
requiring that certain disclosures be made by a developer to a buyer. 
Marketing techniques are important because membership in a homeowner
association is mandatory for a purchaser of a home in community which has
shared property and facilities, such as a condominium, cooperative, or a single
family home in a planned development.  The shared property of such communities
is owned collectively by all of the individual home purchasers.  These
communities are referred to as shared ownership communities in the bill and
are often known as common interest communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It has also been more than 10
years since the Assembly Task Force to Study Homeowners Associations released
its report containing more than 30 recommendations calling for changes in the
laws, in order to provide more protections for homeowners.  This bill addresses
most of those recommendations, as well as updating the laws requiring
disclosure by developers and clarifying the powers and obligations of governing
boards of associations and the rights of owners living in such communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the manner in
which information should be provided prospective purchasers through the Public
Offering Statement, (POS) a document required to be provided to prospective
purchasers by developers of such communities.  Although New Jerseys statutes
require certain disclosures by a developer during the sales phase of shared
ownership communities, these disclosures have too often been inadequate to
properly inform prospective purchasers.  Items which are likely to be of
extreme importance to a purchaser, such as obligations, governance structures,
potential future liabilities, restrictions, or, even in some cases, hidden
loans on the part of a developer to the association, may be buried deep within
the document, and not disclosed adequately, if at all.  The sheer volume of
information, which varies widely by developers on matters which could be
standardized, also hinders adequate review by the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the POS,
and the registration of developments process, to be revised and streamlined.  A
developer will be required to submit information on standardized forms and in
an electronic format.  Governance structures will be standardized and
developers allowed to highlight variations that they wish to apply.  Processing
times for registrations of developments will be reduced under the bill from 90
to 45 days for standardized submissions.  The information in the Public
Offering Statement to be disclosed to a prospective purchaser will be revised
to be quickly accessed by the reader, as well as indexed under logical
headings, such as pets, parking, restrictions and fees.  An executive summary
of the offering is required to be made in plain language, explaining the
rights, liabilities, obligations and governing form applicable to the
association.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also addresses the
problem that planned communities with fewer than 100 units have been exempted
from registration under the act.  This has been interpreted by the
administering agency as exempting developers from providing a POS,
thus providing no protections for purchasers in smaller communities.  The
exemption has also been extended by regulations to all low and moderate income
(<i>Mount Laurel</i>) communities of any size.  Exemption from the PREDFDA also
clouds many other issues, such as when a developer of a planned community must
turn over the assets to the homeowners.  The bill removes these exemptions, and
requires a Public Offering Statement for every prospective purchaser in a
planned community.  The regressive flat rate development charge currently
charged to developers of planned communities is replaced under the bill with a
per unit fee of 3/100 of one percent (.0003) of the sales price.  These fees
are currently required to be used to defray the costs of the States review
under the statute, and will continue to be used for that purpose, as well as to
offset costs for other homeowner protections added by the bill.  The change
from a flat rate fee to a per unit fee will result in lower fees on lower
priced homes, and in most instances will result in decreased fees being paid
per development than is the case now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
addresses problems which arise in what may be termed the governance stage of
a homeowners association.  After the developer has sold at least 75 percent of
the homes planned for the community, total control of the management of the
commonly-owned property is transferred from the developer to the home owners in
the community.  Experience shows that owners are not adequately prepared for
this event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows owners to have
earlier exposure to operational issues and input into governance matters, as
well as requires boards to adopt principles of democratic and transparent
governance.  The bill requires the creation of an owners coordinating council
in each association, consisting of at least three owners, during the time
period that the developer controls the voting interest of the association
governing board.  The owners coordinating council will function as a steering
committee for owners, and serve as the election monitor when owners other than the
developer are entitled by statute to be elected as voting members of the
governing board.  In addition, the owners council will be permitted to bring
claims to a commission formed under the bill, on matters affecting construction
deficiencies in the common elements during the period of developer control. 
The inability of owners to file warranty claims concerning defects in common
elements was found to be a problem by the State Commission of Investigation in
its report of abuses in the new home construction industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill addresses the
inconsistency in various statutes affecting owners rights in different types
of shared ownership communities, by amending the laws to eliminate these
inconsistencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates a commission
in, but not of, the Department of Law and Public Safety, to serve as a State
resource center, liaison and educational resource to owners and their shared
ownership community associations, and to coordinate low cost, reliable
alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services to these associations.  The
commission will also serve as a hearing entity concerning violations of
statutory law pertaining to associations. The commission is modeled after a
very successful program created by Montgomery County, Maryland for homeowner
associations under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill addresses a critical
need of the many owners whose associations have not provided any ADR or ADR
which is not impartial.  Many associations have adopted a process too biased or
expensive to serve as a viable alternative to litigation.  Because associations
can charge each owner the cost of the boards attorney as a common expense,
many boards are quick to invite litigation, rather than amicably resolve
disputes.  In some instances, even when a boards actions blatantly violate
bylaws, or are flagrantly illegal, State and local officials are often
unwilling or unable to get involved, citing the private nature of such
communities.  This places an undue financial burden on individual owners, many
of whom are senior citizens on fixed incomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also addresses the
general lack of information about community associations, and a lack of
standards for the manner in which they may operate.  The commission created by
the bill and the State entity responsible for oversight of marketing of new
homes is charged with creating a booklet providing detailed information to
owners concerning general information, State and federal laws, resources
available, and the standards of governance established for association
governing boards.  The commission will also be responsible for posting the
information to a web site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is also
required under the bill to promulgate standards for transparent and democratic
governance in the operation of shared ownership communities.  The standards may
be more specific than the provisions of the bill, but must comport with the
Legislatures intent to foster open, democratic processes in such communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The funding for the activities
of the commission and the alternative dispute resolution services will come
from fees already collected and earmarked for protections of owners under the
&quot;The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act.&quot;  The bill
requires that all associations provide certain information annually to the Commission
on Shared Ownership Communities.  There is no fee to file under the bill, but
those associations that do not provide the information will not be eligible as
qualified private communities to seek reimbursement from their municipality for
services provided to them, such as trash, leaf and snow removal, and, in
addition, will not be permitted to impose fines upon members, or to receive
approval to file liens based on fines imposed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>   In order to recognize the
governmental nature of homeowners associations, and to provide the best
enforcement of statutory protections for prospective homebuyers in shared
ownership communities, the bill moves the responsibility for the The Planned
Real Estate Development Act to a new bureau within the Division of Consumer
Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety, to be known as the Bureau
of Homebuyers Protection.  The Division of Consumer Affairs currently has
significant experience in administering consumer protection programs; for
example it has the responsibility for overseeing the Home Improvement
Contractors Registration Act and the consumer fraud act.  In addition,
relocating homebuyer protections will help to minimize conflicts of interests
concerning builders under other programs in the Department of Community
Affairs, such as its role as the enforcer of construction codes, licensing of
code inspectors, and overseeing the New Home Warranty Program.</p>
