S1524 SENATE, No. 1524 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS The Owners Rights and Obligations in Shared Ownership Communities Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning rights and obligations of homeowners living in shared ownership communities, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing Title 46 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.     (New section)  This act shall be known and may be cited as the Owners Rights and Obligations in Shared Ownership Communities Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Homeowners associations formed to manage property shared by all homeowners, whether that property be in condominiums, planned communities, or cooperatives, function as quasi-governments, often providing services in lieu of governmental services, levying assessments and imposing fines, and, through their control of maintenance and assessment levels, rulemaking powers, and enforcement efforts, have substantial power to affect both the quality of life and financial health of the individual homeowners comprising their membership. b.    Current statutes are ineffective to compel homeowners' associations to treat fairly the owners of homes in planned communities or the holders of proprietary leases in cooperatives, in the manner of fair treatment required for condominium owners. The Condominium Act, P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.) requires developers and associations to clearly recognize the coexisting interests of each individual homeowner in the commonly-owned facilities of a condominium, by requiring the consent of a majority of the owners prior to making changes in the governing documents.  That act also provides quasi-governmental powers to condominium boards to impose fines on members, and to place liens on their individual homes.  Similar protections and powers have not been enunciated in the statutes for owners of homes or holders of proprietary leases in planned communities and cooperatives, respectively.  The Legislature attempted to expand the law to apply to all types of homeowners association through the enactment of P.L.1993, c.30, but that act has proven ineffective in making sure that owners in all types of these communities are treated fairly and democratically by their governing boards. c.     The unilateral manner in which a developer is permitted under the law to make all decisions for an association until a certain level of sales of homes have been reached may serve to protect the developers investment in the community while he is selling, but does not serve an association well when it is required to act as a governing board and operate in a democratic and fair manner, and in the best interests of all of the owners as required by statute.  While protecting the interests of both, there is a need to clearly separate in the law (1) the interests and role of a developer of a shared ownership community from (2) the interests and role of the association formed to represent the collective shared property interests of owners of individual properties within such communities, and (3) a need to provide standards to association governing boards to foster transparent governance. d.    There is a further need to update New Jerseys laws to provide improved, relevant disclosure to a prospective purchaser as to the exact nature of what is being purchased, and a clear statement of their rights and responsibilities as a member of a homeowners association.  There is a need to standardize certain information, and to allow developers to submit it in an electronic format for an expedited review by the State. e.     There is a need to eliminate exemptions from required disclosures by developers to purchasers in smaller shared ownership communities. f.     In order to minimize State involvement in the affairs of homeowners associations, and in order to reduce the need for litigation by members of associations, there is a need to create a truly objective, reliable, and low cost system of dispute resolution for shared ownership communities which will be overseen and provided by experienced neutral parties, with adequate due process protections. g.    There is a need to foster democratic governance in community associations in the following areas, including, but not limited to, the regulation of elections, budget adoption, access to association records, open meetings, education of owners and governing board members, and to raise awareness of the rights and obligations of owners and those owners serving their communities as governing board members.  The Legislature declares that it is necessary and in the public interest to establish an independent Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, comprised of individuals living in and providing services to such communities, to function as a State liaison for such communities.  The commission will promote an equitable balance between the interests of association governing boards, developers, owners, and residents in these communities, through the provision of information and the establishment of governance standards for such associations, and will serve as a coordinating entity for the provision of alternative dispute resolution services and enforcement of statutory rights. 3.    (New section)  As used in this act: Association, community association or homeowners association means any legal entity, incorporated or unincorporated, that is responsible for the governance over common property of a shared ownership community, regardless of whether the association was required to be formed pursuant to any law or ordinance. Association documents means governing documents. Commission means the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.     , c.     (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Common ownership community means a shared ownership community. Cooperative housing project means any system of land ownership and possession in which the fee title to the land and structure is owned by a corporation in which the shareholders of that corporation each also have a long term proprietary lease or other long term arrangement of exclusive possession for a specific unit of occupancy space located within the same structure. "Declaration" means the recorded document or documents containing the servitudes that create and govern the common ownership community. Director means the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Dispute means any disagreement between two or more parties that conforms to the requirements of section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Executive director means the executive director of the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. Governing body or governing board means the council of unit owners, board of directors, trustees, or any other body authorized by a governing document to adopt binding rules or regulations. "Governing documents" means the declaration and other documents, such as a deed, the articles of incorporation or articles of association, bylaws, and rules and regulations that govern the operation of an association, or determine the rights and obligations of the members of the shared ownership community. "Member" means the owner of an individually-owned property bound by a servitude described in an association document to contribute to maintenance of common property or to pay mandatory dues to the association.  In the case of a shared ownership community in which membership in the association and the obligation to pay assessments are independent, the term member shall mean an owner who is bound by a servitude described in an association document to contribute to maintenance of common property or to pay mandatory dues to the association. Owner means the individual owner of a residence in a shared ownership community, and includes a unit owner in a condominium, a lot owner in a homeowners' association, and a holder of a proprietary lease in a cooperative housing project. Owners coordinating council means the group to which owners may be elected to serve, other than the governing board. Party means a developer, an owner, a governing body, or an occupant of a dwelling unit in a shared ownership community. Period of developer control means the period of time during which a developer has a controlling voting interest in the decisions of the governing board of an association pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), prior to the developers interests terminating. Public Advocate means the commissioner of the Department of the Public Advocate. Shared ownership community means a community in which individual property owners are bound by a servitude in documents required to be recorded for real property, which servitude requires support of the shared or commonly-owned property, and the benefit and use of the shared property is appurtenant to the individually-owned property. A shared ownership community may consist of a fee-simple estate, a leasehold, or an easement, unless the responsibility for maintenance of such easement is determined by the extent of actual use, and it may be any kind of property held or enjoyed in common by owners of the individually owned property.  The term shall include, but not be limited to: a development subject to a declaration, master deed or other document enforced by an association; a residential condominium, as that term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-3 et seq.); and a cooperative housing project. 4.    (New section)  This act is intended to supplement the law on community associations, including, but not limited to, the "Condominium Act," P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.), the Horizontal Property Act, P.L.1963, c.168 (C.46:8A-1 et seq.), The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act," P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.), P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.), and any other law hereinafter enacted regulating shared ownership communities and associations.

(2)   Orders of an arbitrator under this section, if binding arbitration has been selected, shall be binding upon the parties.  The failure of any person to obey a binding order of the arbitrator issued in accordance with this section shall be punishable as contempt of court by the court in the same manner as like failure is punishable in an action pending in the court when the matter is brought before the court by motion filed by the Attorney General and supported by affidavit stating the circumstances.  In the case of a finding by the commission that an officer or trustee of the governing body knowingly or willfully failed to follow the governing documents, such officer or trustee shall be deemed to have vacated their position on the governing body, and a new election for his or her position shall be held within 90 days of the finding. 9.    (New section)  a.  The commission shall arrange for arbitration on all proposed lien filings based on fines imposed within 15 days of submission by an association.  A determination to approve or disapprove an associations request for lien filing on the basis of fines imposed shall be made no later than 60 days from the date of the claim submission.  Extensions may be granted to any party to submit additional information; however, the commission shall have the discretion to disapprove a lien filing upon the repeated failure of an association to provide requested information to either entity. b.    The director shall establish expedited procedures to approve or disapprove lien filings for unpaid fines, and shall establish the forms required to be filed with the county clerk to authorize such lien filing when approved pursuant to this section. c.     Unless otherwise specified in P.L.      , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all hearings and alternative dispute resolution procedures shall be conducted in accordance with procedures adopted by the agency providing the services, and relevant applicable law.  Dispute resolution may be handled as a binding arbitration at the discretion of the commission; if so, an appeal may be made only to the extent allowed for appeals made under binding arbitration. An arbitrator shall make a final determination in any matter no later than 90 days from the last hearing date, but may grant reasonable continuances of the hearing in order to fully investigate the matter. 10.  (New section)  Upon the adoption of the regulations required to be promulgated pursuant to section 14 of P.L.     , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), every association as defined under section 3 of P.L.     , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall complete and submit an annual informational disclosure to the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities established pursuant to section 5 of P.L. , c.

If no order of rejection is entered within 45 or 90 days, respectively, from the date of notice of filing, the development shall be deemed registered unless the applicant has consented in writing to a delay. b.    If the agency affirmatively determines that the requirements of section 9 of [this act] P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-29) have been met, it shall enter an order registering the development. c.     If the agency determines upon inquiry and examination that any of the requirements of section 9 of [this act] P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-29) have not been met, the agency shall notify the applicant that the application for registration must be corrected in such particulars, within 30 days, as designated by the agency. If the requirements are not met within the time allowed, the agency may enter an order rejecting the registration which shall include the findings of fact upon which the order is based.  The order rejecting the registration shall not become effective until 20 days after the lapse of the aforesaid specified period during which 20-day period the applicant may petition for reconsideration and shall be entitled to a hearing.  Such order of rejection shall not take effect, in any event, until such time as the hearing, once requested, has been given to the applicant. (cf: P.L.1977, c.419, s.10) 36.  Section 1 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  [A] Unless exempted as provided in this section, a developer of a planned development, whether or not subject to the registration requirements of section 6 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-26) shall organize or cause to be organized an association whose obligation it shall be to manage the common elements and facilities.  The developer may be exempted from forming an association upon a determination by the agency that there will be no expenses in connection with maintenance of the proposed common property in the community, and all such common property consists solely of unimproved and unencumbered open space.  The association shall be formed on or before the filing of the master deed or declaration of covenants and restrictions, and may be formed as a for-profit corporation only if the development will be a cooperative housing cooperation issuing shares, or a nonprofit corporation[, unincorporated association, or any other form permitted by law] if a condominium or planned development.  The application of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.) to the association of an existing planned real estate development shall not be limited by: (1)   whether the developer has been subject to, or exempted from, the registration requirements of section 6 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-26); or (2)   the development's date of establishment. b.    Nothing in subsection a. of this section shall be construed to require the registration of a planned real estate development that is not otherwise required to register pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-26). c.     Membership in the association of a planned real estate development shall be comprised of each owner within the planned real estate development, and may include the developer if the development contains unsold lots, parcels, units, or interests.  An association may permit tenant participation in executive board elections, tenant membership in the association, or both.  A voting-eligible tenant shall have only the same voting rights as the owner of the unit that the tenant leases, and such voting rights shall be in place of and not in addition to the rights of the owner of the leased unit, except as permitted under paragraph (9) of subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.2017, c.106 (C.45:22A-45.2).  Pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.2017, c.106 (C.45:22A-45.2), the votes associated with a unit shall not be altered by the participation of voting-eligible tenants. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.4) 37.  Section 2 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-44) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  Subject to the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions or other instruments of creation, [the] an association as that term is defined under section 3 of P.L.     , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), may do all that it is legally entitled to do under the laws applicable to its form of organization.  In addition, an association of a shared ownership community shall have the identical powers and obligations to those as set forth in section 15 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-15) for condominium associations. b.    [The] An association shall exercise its powers and discharge its functions in a manner that protects and furthers the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community.  The actions of an association concerning governance of its members shall embody standards of due process, open governance, democracy, and fundamental fairness, similar to those to which governmental bodies are held, in all areas of governance, including, but not limited to elections, access to records, open meetings, and alternate dispute resolution, and shall be judged under these standards. Actions of associations in matters not concerning governance over its members shall be subject to the business judgment rule, but implemented in a manner that protects and furthers the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community. c.     [The] An association shall provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of disputes between individual unit owners and the association, and between unit owners, which shall be readily available as an alternative to litigation.  Any costs of any procedure provided shall be borne as a common expense by all of the members of the association, and not assessed against any individual owner or owners. d.    The association may assert tort claims concerning the common elements and facilities of the development as if the claims were asserted directly by the unit owners individually. (cf: P.L.1993, c.30, s.2) 38.  Section 3 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-45) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  [The form of administration of an] An association [organized pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43)] as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.      , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall provide for the election of [an executive] a governing board, elected by the association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, and responsible to the members of the association pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-46), through which the powers of the association shall be exercised and its functions performed.  All members of the association shall be permitted to be nominated for and run for elected positions on the governing board.  Elections shall be held at least every two years, and shall be conducted with strict adherence to democratic principles and fairness.  If an association has had no election which complies with the provisions of this section before the effective date of P.L.      , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), other than the initial election required pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1993. c.30 (C.45:22A-47), then an election shall be held, to be monitored by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, and in accordance with regulations to be promulgated under P.L.      , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Subject to the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, bylaws or other instruments of creation, subsection d. of this section, and the laws of the State, [the executive] a governing board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. c.     The members of [the executive] a governing board appointed by the developer shall be liable as fiduciaries to the owners for their acts or omissions. d.    During control of [the executive] a governing board by the developer, copies of the annual audit of association funds shall be available for inspection by owners or their authorized representative at the project site. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.5) 39.  Section 4 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-46) is amended to read as follows: 4.    The bylaws of the association, which shall initially be recorded with the master deed shall include, in addition to any other lawful provisions, the following: a.     A requirement that all meetings of the [executive] governing board[, except conference or working sessions at which no binding votes are to be taken,] shall be open to attendance by all unit owners, and adequate notice of any such meeting shall be given to all unit owners in such manner as the bylaws shall prescribe; except that the [executive] governing board may exclude or restrict attendance at those meetings, or portions of meetings, dealing with  (1) any matter the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy; (2) any pending or anticipated litigation or contract negotiations; (3) any matters falling within the attorney-client privilege, to the extent that confidentiality is required in order for the attorney to exercise his ethical duties as a lawyer, or (4) any matter involving the employment, promotion, discipline or dismissal of a specific officer or employee of the association.  At each meeting required under this subsection to be open to all association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, the participation of unit owners, association members and voting eligible-tenants in the proceedings or the provision of a public comment session shall be [at the discretion of the executive board] permitted, but may be limited in duration in accordance with regulations which may be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, minutes of the proceedings shall be taken, and copies of those minutes shall be made available to all unit owners before the next open meeting, or within 60 days, whichever is sooner, or shall be in accordance with any regulations promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. b.    The method of calling meetings of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, the percentage of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, or voting rights required to make decisions and to constitute a quorum.  The bylaws may, nevertheless, provide that an individual association member, and a voting-eligible tenant where applicable, may waive notice of meetings in writing, or may act by written agreement without meetings. c.     The manner of collecting from unit owners their respective shares of common expenses and the method of distribution to the unit owners of their respective shares of common surplus or such other application of common surplus as may be duly authorized by the bylaws. d.    (1) The method by which the bylaws may be amended, provided that no amendment shall be effective until recorded in the same office as the then existing bylaws.  The bylaws may also provide a method for the adoption, amendment and enforcement of reasonable administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation, use, maintenance and enjoyment of the units and of the common elements, including limited common elements. (2)   If association bylaws provide for no method of their amendment by a vote of the association members open to all association members, or only allow association members to amend the bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then the association members may amend the bylaws by an affirmative vote of a majority of the total authorized votes in the association.  If the bylaws do not provide for a method by which the association members may call a meeting of the association members to conduct a vote to amend the bylaws or do not contain provisions concerning the subject matter of subparagraphs (a) through (f) of this paragraph, then a vote concerning an amendment to the bylaws shall be conducted as follows: (a)   fifteen percent of the association members may request a meeting of the association's membership by executing a document requesting that a special meeting of the association membership be held, or if the annual meeting of the association membership is scheduled to occur within 60 days of the date of the request, then the amendment vote shall be held at the annual meeting; (b)   if the vote is not scheduled to take place at the annual meeting of the association, the executive board shall schedule the special meeting of the association membership to occur within 60 days of the receipt of the request.  Notice of the meeting shall be provided to the association members and voting-eligible tenants, where applicable, at least 14 days prior to the date of the meeting.  The special meeting shall be held at a reasonable time that is likely to permit most association members to attend; (c)   the language of the proposed amendment shall be unambiguous and consistent with applicable law and with the provisions of the bylaws that are not proposed to be amended, and if not in such condition shall be revised to satisfy that requirement.  Upon satisfaction of this requirement, the amendment shall be mailed, hand-delivered or, if the bylaws permit, electronically delivered, together with the notice of the meeting to the association membership at least 10 days prior to the meeting; (d)   if permitted by the association's bylaws, the notice of the meeting shall include a proxy ballot or absentee ballot with instructions for the return of same, which instructions shall permit facsimile or electronic mail delivery of the proxy ballot or absentee ballot to the association and shall not require receipt of the proxy or absentee ballot more than one business day prior to the meeting; (e)   if a sufficient number of ballots or proxies are not received at the special or annual meeting to conclusively determine that the proposed amendment has been approved or rejected, the meeting shall be adjourned for a period of 30 days, or such longer period as approved by the association membership by approval of a motion to extend the vote concerning the amendment, but in no event for longer than 11 months from when the notice of the meeting was sent, and all proxies or ballots received prior to the extended date shall remain valid if otherwise valid under the terms of the bylaws; and (f)   when an amendment is approved, a copy of the approved amendment shall be provided to all association members, and the association shall promptly record the  amendment in the county recording office where the bylaws were recorded. (3)   Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not be construed to require a vote to be held on an amendment to the bylaws that has been voted on in the preceding 12 months of the initial meeting request, made pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of this subsection. (4)   For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the number of total authorized votes in the association shall be based on the whole number of units owned by someone entitled to association membership  after subtracting those  association members who are ineligible to vote because they are not in good standing. (5)   An executive board shall not amend the bylaws of an association without a vote of the association members open to all association members, as provided in the association's bylaws, or where the bylaws provide for no method of their amendment by a vote of the association members, or only allow association members to amend the bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then an association shall only amend the bylaws pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, except an executive board may amend the bylaws under the following circumstances: (a)   to the extent necessary to render the bylaws consistent with State, federal or local law; or (b)   after providing notice to all association members of the proposed amendment, which notice shall include a ballot to reject the proposed amendment.  Other than an amendment to render the bylaws consistent with State, federal, or local law, if at least 10 percent of association members vote to reject the amendment within 30 days of its mailing, the amendment shall be deemed defeated. e.     Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.) to the contrary, all bylaws and association documents of an association shall comply with the minimum requirements of sections 16 and 18 of P.L.      , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for such documents, or shall be deemed to include such provisions by incorporation through this section. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.7) 40.  Section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  Upon the sale of 20 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests to be created in the community, the developer shall arrange for the members of the association to hold an election for an owners coordinating council, which group shall be comprised of at least three owners other than the developer.  The council shall be a steering committee for owners complaints and to provide guidance to the developer and association on issues of importance to the owners.  In addition, the council shall coordinate the elections to the association governing board when owners may be elected to that board in accordance with this section, and shall serve as the owners finance committee during the period of developer control.  All elections to this group shall comply with election guidelines to be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.       , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that only members elected by the unit owners, other than the developer or developers appointees to the governing board, shall serve on the council, and the council's decisions shall be free of any control by the developer or any member of the governing board appointed by the developer.  Any vacancies on the council shall be filled within 30 days by current council members, and in the case of any tie votes by such council members, by the vote of the unit owners other than the developer within 60 days after the vacancy occurs. Irrespective of the time set for developer control of the association provided in the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, or other instruments of creation, control of the voting interests of the governing board of the association shall be surrendered to the owners in the following manner: (1)   Sixty days after conveyance of 25 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, not fewer than 25 percent of the members of the [executive] governing board shall be elected by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, in accordance with election procedures to be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. (2)   Sixty days after conveyance of 50 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, not fewer than 40 percent of the members of the [executive] governing board shall be elected by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable. (3)   Sixty days after conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, the developer's control of the [executive] governing board shall terminate, at which time the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, shall elect the entire [executive] governing board; except that the developer may retain the selection of one [executive] governing board member representing his interests as a unit owner so long as there are any units remaining unsold in the regular course of business.  The retention by the developer of one member on the governing board shall cease if no units remain which are being offered for sale to the public.  Unsold units converted to rental units by a developer shall create a presumption that the developer has ceased selling, and in that event, any tenant of a developer-owned unit shall be deemed to be a member of the association as if the tenant owns the unit. b.    The percentages specified in subsection a. of this section shall be calculated upon the basis of the whole number of units entitled to membership in the association.  The bylaws of the association shall specify the number or proportion of votes of all units conveyed to owners that shall be required for the election of executive board members.  Unless the bylaws provide for  an alternate approach to allocating votes pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.2017, c.106 (C.45:22A-45.2), each unit conveyed to an owner shall be entitled to one vote regardless of the number of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, residing in a unit.  A developer may surrender control of the executive board of the association before the time specified in subsection a. of this section, if the association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, agree by a majority vote to assume control. c.     Upon assumption by the owners of control of the [executive] voting interests of the governing board of the association, the developer shall deliver to the association all items and documents pertinent to the association, such as, but not limited to, a copy of the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, documents of creation of the association, bylaws, minute book including all minutes, any rules and regulations, association funds and an accounting therefor, all personal property, insurance policies, government permits, a membership roster and all contracts and agreements relative to the association within 60 days of  that transition date, established pursuant to this section.  In addition, all similar items required to be turned over by a developer of a condominium pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-12.1) shall be required to be turned over by a developer of a shared ownership community to the association. d.    The association when controlled by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, shall not take any action that would be detrimental to the sale of units by the developer, and shall continue the same level of maintenance, operation and services as immediately prior to their assumption of control, until the last unit is sold. e.     From the time of conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units, or interests, until the last lot, parcel, unit, or interest in the development is conveyed in the ordinary course of business, the master deed, bylaws or declaration of covenants and restrictions shall not require that more than 75 percent of the votes entitled to be cast thereon be cast in the affirmative for a change in the bylaws or regulations of the association. f.     The developer shall not be permitted to cast any votes allocated to unsold lots, parcels, units, or interests, in order to amend the master deed, bylaws, or any other document, for the purpose of changing the permitted use of a lot, parcel, unit, or interest, or for the purpose of reducing the common elements or facilities. g.    If the council of owners authorized in subsection a. of this section is established and there has been substantial completion of the common elements and public improvements in any phase of the shared ownership community which are not covered by the performance or maintenance guarantees posted with any governmental agencies having jurisdiction, the council shall request the association to cause such common elements and improvements to be inspected and evaluated for compliance with the developer's warranty and construction obligations, with the assistance of qualified independent engineering and legal consultants selected by the council.  The fees for such consultants shall be paid from funds contributed by the developer. (1)   Public improvements to be dedicated to any governmental entity shall be exempt from any direct warranty or construction defect claims by the association or the unit owners other than the developer.  Acceptance of any such public improvements by the governmental entity to which they are to be dedicated shall be deemed conclusive evidence that such improvements have been satisfactorily completed and the developer shall have no further obligation with respect to those improvements, either to the association, to any unit owners other than the developer, or to any governmental agency having jurisdiction. (2)   Within 120 days after the association's receipt of any request for inspection of any phase of the completed common elements or other improvements, the council shall require its engineering consultant to inspect the particular completed improvements and render a written evaluation of them to the council.  A copy of the final report, following the councils review of the initial evaluation, shall be furnished to the developer within 30 days after the committee's receipt of the report.  Thereafter, the council and the developer shall conduct one or more joint inspections of the common elements and other improvements covered by the request and pursue good faith negotiations to resolve any warranty or construction defect claims against the developer.  All fees and related expenses incurred by the council for engineering and legal consultants shall be paid promptly by the association from available designated funds. (3)   If a settlement agreement is finalized between the council and the developer, the developer-controlled executive board shall have the authority to execute an agreement and to release the declarant from all liability with respect to the completed common elements and improvements, subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the agreement.  Any such settlement agreement and release shall be legally binding upon the association and the unit owners, provided that its form is approved by the independent legal counsel retained by the council on behalf of the association. (4)   If no settlement agreement is approved by the council within 180 days after the request for inspection, the parties shall be obligated to proceed to mediation within 30 days thereafter in accordance with section 10 of P.L.       , c.      (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  If no settlement is reached through mediation within 15 days after commencement of same, then the parties shall promptly proceed to non-binding arbitration of any remaining issues in accordance with rules promulgated by the director.  Such mediation and non-binding arbitration shall be conditions precedent to any litigation of the warranty and construction defect claims against the developer.  All professional fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the association with regard to the mediation or arbitration, or both, shall be borne by the owners, including the developer, in the same manner as common expenses are allocated and paid by the association promptly upon the receipt of written authorization of the council. (5)   In the event that no settlement agreement and releases are executed with respect to any completed common elements or improvements during the period of developer control of the governing board of the association, any statutes of limitation or repose applicable to that association concerning common elements, including, but not limited to statutory warranties, shall be extended for a period of one year after the assumption of control of the governing board by owners other than the developer. (6)   The procedures set forth in this section shall also apply to and be binding upon the developer and the association after the unit owners, other than the developer, assume control of the governing board of the association; provided, however, that the governing board after that transition shall not be bound by the recommendations of the council of owners.  The governing board controlled by the owners may vote to abolish the council of owners at any time after the owners have assumed control of the governing board. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.8) 41.  Section 6 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-48) is amended to read as follows: 6.    The [Commissioner of Community Affairs] Commission on Shared Ownership Communities shall cause to be prepared and distributed, for the use and guidance of associations, [executive] governing boards and [administrators] professionals hired by such boards to assist them, explanatory materials and guidelines to assist them in achieving proper and timely compliance with the requirements of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et al.) and with the requirements of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Such guidelines may include the text of model bylaw provisions suggested or recommended for adoption. The commission shall also make available, on an Internet web site maintained by it, descriptions of the outcomes of dispute resolution procedures overseen by the commission, indexed by subject matter. The commission shall publish a quarterly newsletter to be furnished to any member of any association requesting it and shall also publish the newsletter electronically for viewing on the Internet. [Failure or refusal of an association or executive board to make proper amendment or supplementation of its bylaws prior to the effective date of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et al.) shall not, however, affect their obligation of compliance therewith on and after that effective date.] Any owner or tenant of an owner in a shared ownership community may seek the assistance of the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to address the failure of an association to make proper amendment or supplementation of its bylaws in order to comply with any statutory requirements. (cf: P.L.1993, c.30, s.6) 42.  Section 14 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  The association, acting through its officers or governing board, shall be responsible for the performance of the following duties, the costs of which shall be common expenses: (a)   The maintenance, repair, replacement, cleaning and sanitation of the common elements. (b)   The assessment and collection of funds for common expenses and the payment thereof. (c)   The adoption, distribution, amendment and enforcement of rules governing the use and operation of the condominium and the condominium property and the use of the common elements, including but not limited to the imposition of reasonable fines, assessments and late fees upon unit owners, if authorized by the master deed or bylaws, subject to the right of a majority of unit owners to change any such rules. (d)   The maintenance of insurance against loss by fire or other casualties normally covered under broad-form fire and extended coverage insurance policies as written in this State, covering all common elements and all structural portions of the condominium property and the application of the proceeds of any such insurance to restoration of such common elements and structural portions[ if such restoration shall otherwise be required under the provisions of this act or the master deed or bylaws]. (e)   The maintenance of insurance against liability for personal injury and death for accidents occurring within the common elements whether limited or general and the defense of any actions brought by reason of injury or death to person, or damage to property occurring within such common elements and not arising by reason of any act or negligence of any individual unit owner. (f)   The master deed or bylaws may require the association to protect blanket mortgages, or unit owners and their mortgagees, as their respective interest may appear, under the policies of insurance provided under clauses (d) and (e) of this section, or against such risks with respect to any or all units, and may permit the assessment and collection from a unit owner of specific charges for insurance coverage applicable to his unit. (g)   The maintenance of [accounting] records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, open to inspection at reasonable times by unit owners.  Such records shall include: (i)    A record of all receipts and expenditures.

(i)    Such other duties as may be set forth in the master deed or bylaws. (j)    An association shall exercise its powers and discharge its functions in a manner that protects and furthers or is not inconsistent with the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community. (k)   An association shall provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of [housing-related] disputes between individual unit owners and the association, and between unit owners, which shall be readily available as an alternative to litigation.  Any costs associated with the procedure shall be borne by the association as a common expense, and no costs shall be assessable against any individual owner or owners.  A person other than an officer of the association, a member of the governing board or a unit owner involved in the dispute shall be made available to resolve the dispute.  [A unit owner may notify the Commissioner of Community Affairs if an association does not comply with this subsection.  The commissioner shall have the power to order the association to provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of disputes] A unit owner who has availed himself of the dispute resolution procedures provided by his association, but who does not consider the matter resolved, may file a request for dispute resolution services with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, established pursuant to section 5 of P.L. , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.1996, c.79, s.2) 43.  Section 12 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  The association provided for by the master deed shall be responsible for the administration and management of the condominium and condominium property, including but not limited to the conduct of all activities [of common interest to] on the common property of the unit owners.  The association may be any entity recognized by the laws of New Jersey, including but not limited to a business corporation or a nonprofit corporation.  Condominium associations established after the effective date of P.L.      , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)  shall be incorporated as nonprofit corporations. (cf: P.L.1969, c.257, s.12) 44.  Section 2 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-12.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  [When] For associations formed prior to the effective date of P.L.       , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when unit owners other than the developer own 25% or more of the units in a condominium that will be operated ultimately by an association, the unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect not less than 25% of the members of the governing board or other form of administration of the association.  Unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect not less than 40% of the members of the governing board or other form of administration upon the conveyance of 50% of the units in a condominium.  Unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect all of the members of the governing board or other form of administration upon the conveyance of 75% of the units in a condominium. However, when some of the units of a condominium have been conveyed to purchasers and none of the others are being constructed or offered for sale by the developer in the ordinary course of business, the unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect all of the members of the governing board or other form of administration. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection a of this section, the developer shall be entitled to elect at least one member of the governing board  or other form of administration of an association as long as the developer  holds for sale in the ordinary course of business one or more units in a  condominium operated by the association. b.    Within 30 days after the unit owners other than the developer are entitled to elect a member or members of the governing board or other form of administration of an association, the association shall call, and give not less than 20 days' nor more than 30 days' notice of, a meeting of the unit owners to elect the members of the governing board or other form of administration.  The meeting may be called and the notice given by any unit owner if the association fails to do so. c.     If a developer holds one or more units for sale in the ordinary course of business, none of the following actions may be taken without approval in writing by the developer: (1)   Assessment of the developer as a unit owner for capital improvements. (2)   Any action by the association that would be detrimental to the sales of units by the developer. However, an increase in assessments for common expenses without discrimination against the developer shall not be deemed to be detrimental to the sales of units. On or after the after the effective date of P.L.     , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), elections for and control of a governing board of an association shall be in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47). d.    [Prior to, or not more than 60 days after, the time that unit owners other than the developer elect a majority of the members of the governing board  or other form of administration of an association, the developer shall relinquish control of the association, and the unit owners shall accept control.  Simultaneously,] When control of an association is required to be relinquished by a developer pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), the developer shall deliver to the association all property of the unit owners and of the association held or controlled by the developer, including, but not limited to, the following items, if applicable, as to each condominium operated by the association: (1)   A photocopy of the master deed and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the actual master deed. (2)   A certified copy of the association's articles of incorporation, or if not incorporated, then copies of the documents creating the association. (3)   A copy of the bylaws. (4)   The minute books, including all minutes, and other books and records of the association, if any. (5)   Any house rules and regulations which have been promulgated. (6)   Resignations of officers and members of the governing board or other form of administration who are required to resign because the developer is required to relinquish control of the association. (7)   An accounting for all association funds, including capital accounts and contributions. (8)   Association funds or control thereof. (9)   All tangible personal property that is property of the association, represented by the developer to be part of the common elements or ostensibly part of the common elements, and an inventory of that property. (10) A copy of the plans and specifications utilized in the construction or remodeling of improvements and the supplying of equipment to the condominium and in the construction and installation of all mechanical components serving the improvements and the site, with a certificate in affidavit form of the developer, his agent, or an architect or engineer authorized to practice in  this State that such plans and specifications represent, to the best of their  knowledge and belief, the actual plans and specifications utilized in the construction and improvement of the condominium property and for the construction and installation of the mechanical components serving the improvements.  If the condominium property has been declared a condominium more than 3 years after the completion of construction or remodeling of the improvements, the requirements of this paragraph shall not apply. (11)  Insurance policies. (12) Copies of any certificates of occupancy which may have been issued for the condominium property. (13)  Any other permits issued by governmental bodies applicable to the condominium property in force or issued within 1 year prior to the date the unit owners other than the developer take control of the association. (14)  All written warranties of the contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, and manufacturers, if any, that are still effective. (15)  A roster of unit owners and their addresses and telephone numbers, if known, as shown on the developer's records. (16)  Leases of the common elements and other leases to which the association is a party. (17)  Employment contracts, management contracts, maintenance contracts, contracts for the supply of equipment or materials, and service contracts in which the association is one of the contracting parties and maintenance contracts and service contracts in which the association or the unit owners have an obligation or responsibility, directly or indirectly to pay some or all of the fee or charge of the person or persons performing the service. (18)  All other contracts to which the association is a party. (cf: P.L.1979, c.157, s.2) 45.  Section 15 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-15) is amended to read as follows: 15.  Subject to the provisions of the master deed, the bylaws, rules and regulations and the provisions of this act or other applicable law, the association shall have the following powers: (a)   Whether or not incorporated, the association shall be an entity which shall act through its officers and may enter into contracts, bring suit and be sued.  If the association is not incorporated, it may be deemed to be an entity existing pursuant to this act and a majority of the members of the governing board or of the association, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Process may be served upon the association by serving any officer of the association or by serving the agent designated for service of process.  Service of process upon the association shall not constitute service of process upon any individual unit owner. (b)   The association shall have access to each unit from time to time during reasonable hours as may be necessary for the maintenance, repair or replacement of any common elements therein or accessible therefrom or for making emergency repairs necessary to prevent damage to common elements or to any other unit or units.  The association may charge the unit owner for the repair of any common element damaged by the unit owner or his tenant. (c)   The association may purchase units in the condominium and otherwise acquire, hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same.  It may also lease or license the use of common elements in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of unit owners. (d)   The association may acquire or enter into agreements whereby it acquires leaseholds, memberships or other possessory or use interests in lands or facilities including, but not limited to country clubs, golf courses, marinas and other recreational facilities, whether or not contiguous to the condominium property, intended to provide for the enjoyment, recreation or other use or benefit of the unit owners.  If fully described in the master deed or bylaws, the fees, costs and expenses of acquiring, maintaining, operating, repairing and replacing any such memberships, interests and facilities shall be common expenses.  If not so described in the master deed or bylaws as originally recorded, no such membership interest or facility shall be acquired except pursuant to amendment of or supplement to the master deed or bylaws duly adopted as provided therein and in this act.  In the absence of such amendment or supplement, if some but not all unit owners desire any such acquisition and agree to assume among themselves all costs of acquisition, maintenance, operation, repair and replacement thereof, the association may acquire or enter into an agreement to acquire the same as limited common elements appurtenant only to the units of those unit owners who have agreed to bear the costs and expenses thereof.  Such costs and expenses shall be assessed against and collected from the agreeing unit owners in the proportions in which they share as among themselves in the common expenses in the absence of some other unanimous agreement among themselves. No other unit owner shall be charged with any such cost or expense; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the extension of the interests in such limited common elements to additional unit owners by subsequent agreement with all those unit owners then having an interest in such limited common elements. (e)   The association may levy and collect assessments duly made by the association for a share of common expenses [or otherwise], including any other moneys duly owed the association, upon proper notice to the appropriate unit owner, together with interest thereon, late fees and reasonable attorneys' fees, if authorized by the master deed or bylaws. All funds collected by an association shall be maintained separately in the association's name. For investment purposes only, reserve funds may be commingled with operating funds of the association. Commingled operating and reserve funds shall be accounted for separately, and a commingled account shall not, at any time, be less than the amount identified as reserve funds.  A manager or business entity managing a condominium, or an agent, employee, officer, or director of an association, shall not commingle any association funds with his or her funds or with the funds of any other condominium association or the funds of another association as defined in section 3 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-23). [If] Other than during the period of developer control as set forth in section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), if authorized by the master deed or bylaws, the association may levy and collect a capital contribution, membership fee or other charge upon the [initial sale or subsequent] resale of a unit, which collection shall be earmarked for the purpose of maintenance of or improvements to common elements to defray common expenses [or otherwise], provided that such charge shall not exceed nine times the amount of the most recent monthly common expense assessment for that unit. (f)   If authorized by the master deed or bylaws, the association may impose reasonable fines upon unit owners for failure to comply with provisions of the master deed, bylaws or rules and regulations, subject to the following provisions: A fine for a violation or a continuing violation of the master deed, bylaws or rules and regulations shall not exceed [the maximum monetary penalty permitted to be imposed for a violation or a continuing violation under section 19 of the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-19)] $50 per violation per day , or a total of $2,500 for continuing violations. On roads or streets with respect to which Title 39 of the Revised Statutes is in effect under section 1 of P.L.1945, c.284 (C.39:5A-1), an association may not impose fines for moving automobile violations. A fine shall not be imposed unless the association has filed the required information with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and the unit owner is given written notice of the action taken and of the alleged basis for the action, and is advised of the right to participate in a dispute resolution procedure in accordance with subsection (k) of section 14 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-14), and advised of the further right to file an appeal with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities.  A unit owner who does not believe that the dispute resolution procedure has satisfactorily resolved the matter shall not be prevented from seeking dispute resolution with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities in the manner provided under section 5 of P.L.       , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or from seeking a judicial remedy in a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case the filing of a lien for any fine imposed shall be postponed until a final determination has been made concerning the fine by either the commission or the court. (g)   Such other powers as may be set forth in the master deed or bylaws, if not prohibited by P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.) or any other law of this State. (cf: P.L.2007, c.165, s.1) 46.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT It has been more than 40 years since the Legislature enacted "The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act," (PREDFDA), P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.) to provide State oversight of the marketing of planned developments to prospective purchasers, through a review of documents and advertisements, as well as requiring that certain disclosures be made by a developer to a buyer. Marketing techniques are important because membership in a homeowner association is mandatory for a purchaser of a home in community which has shared property and facilities, such as a condominium, cooperative, or a single family home in a planned development.  The shared property of such communities is owned collectively by all of the individual home purchasers.  These communities are referred to as shared ownership communities in the bill and are often known as common interest communities. It has also been more than 10 years since the Assembly Task Force to Study Homeowners Associations released its report containing more than 30 recommendations calling for changes in the laws, in order to provide more protections for homeowners.  This bill addresses most of those recommendations, as well as updating the laws requiring disclosure by developers and clarifying the powers and obligations of governing boards of associations and the rights of owners living in such communities. The bill revises the manner in which information should be provided prospective purchasers through the Public Offering Statement, (POS) a document required to be provided to prospective purchasers by developers of such communities.  Although New Jerseys statutes require certain disclosures by a developer during the sales phase of shared ownership communities, these disclosures have too often been inadequate to properly inform prospective purchasers.  Items which are likely to be of extreme importance to a purchaser, such as obligations, governance structures, potential future liabilities, restrictions, or, even in some cases, hidden loans on the part of a developer to the association, may be buried deep within the document, and not disclosed adequately, if at all.  The sheer volume of information, which varies widely by developers on matters which could be standardized, also hinders adequate review by the State. The bill requires the POS, and the registration of developments process, to be revised and streamlined.  A developer will be required to submit information on standardized forms and in an electronic format.  Governance structures will be standardized and developers allowed to highlight variations that they wish to apply.  Processing times for registrations of developments will be reduced under the bill from 90 to 45 days for standardized submissions.  The information in the Public Offering Statement to be disclosed to a prospective purchaser will be revised to be quickly accessed by the reader, as well as indexed under logical headings, such as pets, parking, restrictions and fees.  An executive summary of the offering is required to be made in plain language, explaining the rights, liabilities, obligations and governing form applicable to the association. The bill also addresses the problem that planned communities with fewer than 100 units have been exempted from registration under the act.  This has been interpreted by the administering agency as exempting developers from providing a POS, thus providing no protections for purchasers in smaller communities.  The exemption has also been extended by regulations to all low and moderate income (Mount Laurel) communities of any size.  Exemption from the PREDFDA also clouds many other issues, such as when a developer of a planned community must turn over the assets to the homeowners.  The bill removes these exemptions, and requires a Public Offering Statement for every prospective purchaser in a planned community.  The regressive flat rate development charge currently charged to developers of planned communities is replaced under the bill with a per unit fee of 3/100 of one percent (.0003) of the sales price.  These fees are currently required to be used to defray the costs of the States review under the statute, and will continue to be used for that purpose, as well as to offset costs for other homeowner protections added by the bill.  The change from a flat rate fee to a per unit fee will result in lower fees on lower priced homes, and in most instances will result in decreased fees being paid per development than is the case now. In addition, the bill addresses problems which arise in what may be termed the governance stage of a homeowners association.  After the developer has sold at least 75 percent of the homes planned for the community, total control of the management of the commonly-owned property is transferred from the developer to the home owners in the community.  Experience shows that owners are not adequately prepared for this event. The bill allows owners to have earlier exposure to operational issues and input into governance matters, as well as requires boards to adopt principles of democratic and transparent governance.  The bill requires the creation of an owners coordinating council in each association, consisting of at least three owners, during the time period that the developer controls the voting interest of the association governing board.  The owners coordinating council will function as a steering committee for owners, and serve as the election monitor when owners other than the developer are entitled by statute to be elected as voting members of the governing board.  In addition, the owners council will be permitted to bring claims to a commission formed under the bill, on matters affecting construction deficiencies in the common elements during the period of developer control. The inability of owners to file warranty claims concerning defects in common elements was found to be a problem by the State Commission of Investigation in its report of abuses in the new home construction industry. The bill addresses the inconsistency in various statutes affecting owners rights in different types of shared ownership communities, by amending the laws to eliminate these inconsistencies. The bill creates a commission in, but not of, the Department of Law and Public Safety, to serve as a State resource center, liaison and educational resource to owners and their shared ownership community associations, and to coordinate low cost, reliable alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services to these associations.  The commission will also serve as a hearing entity concerning violations of statutory law pertaining to associations. The commission is modeled after a very successful program created by Montgomery County, Maryland for homeowner associations under its jurisdiction. The bill addresses a critical need of the many owners whose associations have not provided any ADR or ADR which is not impartial.  Many associations have adopted a process too biased or expensive to serve as a viable alternative to litigation.  Because associations can charge each owner the cost of the boards attorney as a common expense, many boards are quick to invite litigation, rather than amicably resolve disputes.  In some instances, even when a boards actions blatantly violate bylaws, or are flagrantly illegal, State and local officials are often unwilling or unable to get involved, citing the private nature of such communities.  This places an undue financial burden on individual owners, many of whom are senior citizens on fixed incomes. The bill also addresses the general lack of information about community associations, and a lack of standards for the manner in which they may operate.  The commission created by the bill and the State entity responsible for oversight of marketing of new homes is charged with creating a booklet providing detailed information to owners concerning general information, State and federal laws, resources available, and the standards of governance established for association governing boards.  The commission will also be responsible for posting the information to a web site. The commission is also required under the bill to promulgate standards for transparent and democratic governance in the operation of shared ownership communities.  The standards may be more specific than the provisions of the bill, but must comport with the Legislatures intent to foster open, democratic processes in such communities. The funding for the activities of the commission and the alternative dispute resolution services will come from fees already collected and earmarked for protections of owners under the "The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act."  The bill requires that all associations provide certain information annually to the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities.  There is no fee to file under the bill, but those associations that do not provide the information will not be eligible as qualified private communities to seek reimbursement from their municipality for services provided to them, such as trash, leaf and snow removal, and, in addition, will not be permitted to impose fines upon members, or to receive approval to file liens based on fines imposed. In order to recognize the governmental nature of homeowners associations, and to provide the best enforcement of statutory protections for prospective homebuyers in shared ownership communities, the bill moves the responsibility for the The Planned Real Estate Development Act to a new bureau within the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety, to be known as the Bureau of Homebuyers Protection.  The Division of Consumer Affairs currently has significant experience in administering consumer protection programs; for example it has the responsibility for overseeing the Home Improvement Contractors Registration Act and the consumer fraud act.  In addition, relocating homebuyer protections will help to minimize conflicts of interests concerning builders under other programs in the Department of Community Affairs, such as its role as the enforcer of construction codes, licensing of code inspectors, and overseeing the New Home Warranty Program.

S1524 SENATE, No. 1524 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  SHIRLEY K. TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS The Owners Rights and Obligations in Shared Ownership Communities Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning rights and obligations of homeowners living in shared ownership communities, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing Title 46 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.     (New section)  This act shall be known and may be cited as the Owners Rights and Obligations in Shared Ownership Communities Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Homeowners associations formed to manage property shared by all homeowners, whether that property be in condominiums, planned communities, or cooperatives, function as quasi-governments, often providing services in lieu of governmental services, levying assessments and imposing fines, and, through their control of maintenance and assessment levels, rulemaking powers, and enforcement efforts, have substantial power to affect both the quality of life and financial health of the individual homeowners comprising their membership. b.    Current statutes are ineffective to compel homeowners' associations to treat fairly the owners of homes in planned communities or the holders of proprietary leases in cooperatives, in the manner of fair treatment required for condominium owners. The Condominium Act, P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.) requires developers and associations to clearly recognize the coexisting interests of each individual homeowner in the commonly-owned facilities of a condominium, by requiring the consent of a majority of the owners prior to making changes in the governing documents.  That act also provides quasi-governmental powers to condominium boards to impose fines on members, and to place liens on their individual homes.  Similar protections and powers have not been enunciated in the statutes for owners of homes or holders of proprietary leases in planned communities and cooperatives, respectively.  The Legislature attempted to expand the law to apply to all types of homeowners association through the enactment of P.L.1993, c.30, but that act has proven ineffective in making sure that owners in all types of these communities are treated fairly and democratically by their governing boards. c.     The unilateral manner in which a developer is permitted under the law to make all decisions for an association until a certain level of sales of homes have been reached may serve to protect the developers investment in the community while he is selling, but does not serve an association well when it is required to act as a governing board and operate in a democratic and fair manner, and in the best interests of all of the owners as required by statute.  While protecting the interests of both, there is a need to clearly separate in the law (1) the interests and role of a developer of a shared ownership community from (2) the interests and role of the association formed to represent the collective shared property interests of owners of individual properties within such communities, and (3) a need to provide standards to association governing boards to foster transparent governance. d.    There is a further need to update New Jerseys laws to provide improved, relevant disclosure to a prospective purchaser as to the exact nature of what is being purchased, and a clear statement of their rights and responsibilities as a member of a homeowners association.  There is a need to standardize certain information, and to allow developers to submit it in an electronic format for an expedited review by the State. e.     There is a need to eliminate exemptions from required disclosures by developers to purchasers in smaller shared ownership communities. f.     In order to minimize State involvement in the affairs of homeowners associations, and in order to reduce the need for litigation by members of associations, there is a need to create a truly objective, reliable, and low cost system of dispute resolution for shared ownership communities which will be overseen and provided by experienced neutral parties, with adequate due process protections. g.    There is a need to foster democratic governance in community associations in the following areas, including, but not limited to, the regulation of elections, budget adoption, access to association records, open meetings, education of owners and governing board members, and to raise awareness of the rights and obligations of owners and those owners serving their communities as governing board members.  The Legislature declares that it is necessary and in the public interest to establish an independent Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, comprised of individuals living in and providing services to such communities, to function as a State liaison for such communities.  The commission will promote an equitable balance between the interests of association governing boards, developers, owners, and residents in these communities, through the provision of information and the establishment of governance standards for such associations, and will serve as a coordinating entity for the provision of alternative dispute resolution services and enforcement of statutory rights. 3.    (New section)  As used in this act: Association, community association or homeowners association means any legal entity, incorporated or unincorporated, that is responsible for the governance over common property of a shared ownership community, regardless of whether the association was required to be formed pursuant to any law or ordinance. Association documents means governing documents. Commission means the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.     , c.     (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Common ownership community means a shared ownership community. Cooperative housing project means any system of land ownership and possession in which the fee title to the land and structure is owned by a corporation in which the shareholders of that corporation each also have a long term proprietary lease or other long term arrangement of exclusive possession for a specific unit of occupancy space located within the same structure. "Declaration" means the recorded document or documents containing the servitudes that create and govern the common ownership community. Director means the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Dispute means any disagreement between two or more parties that conforms to the requirements of section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Executive director means the executive director of the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. Governing body or governing board means the council of unit owners, board of directors, trustees, or any other body authorized by a governing document to adopt binding rules or regulations. "Governing documents" means the declaration and other documents, such as a deed, the articles of incorporation or articles of association, bylaws, and rules and regulations that govern the operation of an association, or determine the rights and obligations of the members of the shared ownership community.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.4) 37.  Section 2 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-44) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  Subject to the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions or other instruments of creation, [the] an association as that term is defined under section 3 of P.L.     , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), may do all that it is legally entitled to do under the laws applicable to its form of organization.  In addition, an association of a shared ownership community shall have the identical powers and obligations to those as set forth in section 15 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-15) for condominium associations. b.    [The] An association shall exercise its powers and discharge its functions in a manner that protects and furthers the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community.  The actions of an association concerning governance of its members shall embody standards of due process, open governance, democracy, and fundamental fairness, similar to those to which governmental bodies are held, in all areas of governance, including, but not limited to elections, access to records, open meetings, and alternate dispute resolution, and shall be judged under these standards. Actions of associations in matters not concerning governance over its members shall be subject to the business judgment rule, but implemented in a manner that protects and furthers the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community. c.     [The] An association shall provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of disputes between individual unit owners and the association, and between unit owners, which shall be readily available as an alternative to litigation.  Any costs of any procedure provided shall be borne as a common expense by all of the members of the association, and not assessed against any individual owner or owners. d.    The association may assert tort claims concerning the common elements and facilities of the development as if the claims were asserted directly by the unit owners individually. (cf: P.L.1993, c.30, s.2) 38.  Section 3 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-45) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  [The form of administration of an] An association [organized pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43)] as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.      , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall provide for the election of [an executive] a governing board, elected by the association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, and responsible to the members of the association pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-46), through which the powers of the association shall be exercised and its functions performed.  All members of the association shall be permitted to be nominated for and run for elected positions on the governing board.  Elections shall be held at least every two years, and shall be conducted with strict adherence to democratic principles and fairness.  If an association has had no election which complies with the provisions of this section before the effective date of P.L.      , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), other than the initial election required pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1993. c.30 (C.45:22A-47), then an election shall be held, to be monitored by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, and in accordance with regulations to be promulgated under P.L.      , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Subject to the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, bylaws or other instruments of creation, subsection d. of this section, and the laws of the State, [the executive] a governing board may act in all instances on behalf of the association. c.     The members of [the executive] a governing board appointed by the developer shall be liable as fiduciaries to the owners for their acts or omissions. d.    During control of [the executive] a governing board by the developer, copies of the annual audit of association funds shall be available for inspection by owners or their authorized representative at the project site. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.5) 39.  Section 4 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-46) is amended to read as follows: 4.    The bylaws of the association, which shall initially be recorded with the master deed shall include, in addition to any other lawful provisions, the following: a.     A requirement that all meetings of the [executive] governing board[, except conference or working sessions at which no binding votes are to be taken,] shall be open to attendance by all unit owners, and adequate notice of any such meeting shall be given to all unit owners in such manner as the bylaws shall prescribe; except that the [executive] governing board may exclude or restrict attendance at those meetings, or portions of meetings, dealing with  (1) any matter the disclosure of which would constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy; (2) any pending or anticipated litigation or contract negotiations; (3) any matters falling within the attorney-client privilege, to the extent that confidentiality is required in order for the attorney to exercise his ethical duties as a lawyer, or (4) any matter involving the employment, promotion, discipline or dismissal of a specific officer or employee of the association.  At each meeting required under this subsection to be open to all association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, the participation of unit owners, association members and voting eligible-tenants in the proceedings or the provision of a public comment session shall be [at the discretion of the executive board] permitted, but may be limited in duration in accordance with regulations which may be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, minutes of the proceedings shall be taken, and copies of those minutes shall be made available to all unit owners before the next open meeting, or within 60 days, whichever is sooner, or shall be in accordance with any regulations promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. b.    The method of calling meetings of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, the percentage of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, or voting rights required to make decisions and to constitute a quorum.  The bylaws may, nevertheless, provide that an individual association member, and a voting-eligible tenant where applicable, may waive notice of meetings in writing, or may act by written agreement without meetings. c.     The manner of collecting from unit owners their respective shares of common expenses and the method of distribution to the unit owners of their respective shares of common surplus or such other application of common surplus as may be duly authorized by the bylaws. d.    (1) The method by which the bylaws may be amended, provided that no amendment shall be effective until recorded in the same office as the then existing bylaws.  The bylaws may also provide a method for the adoption, amendment and enforcement of reasonable administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation, use, maintenance and enjoyment of the units and of the common elements, including limited common elements. (2)   If association bylaws provide for no method of their amendment by a vote of the association members open to all association members, or only allow association members to amend the bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then the association members may amend the bylaws by an affirmative vote of a majority of the total authorized votes in the association.  If the bylaws do not provide for a method by which the association members may call a meeting of the association members to conduct a vote to amend the bylaws or do not contain provisions concerning the subject matter of subparagraphs (a) through (f) of this paragraph, then a vote concerning an amendment to the bylaws shall be conducted as follows: (a)   fifteen percent of the association members may request a meeting of the association's membership by executing a document requesting that a special meeting of the association membership be held, or if the annual meeting of the association membership is scheduled to occur within 60 days of the date of the request, then the amendment vote shall be held at the annual meeting; (b)   if the vote is not scheduled to take place at the annual meeting of the association, the executive board shall schedule the special meeting of the association membership to occur within 60 days of the receipt of the request.  Notice of the meeting shall be provided to the association members and voting-eligible tenants, where applicable, at least 14 days prior to the date of the meeting.  The special meeting shall be held at a reasonable time that is likely to permit most association members to attend; (c)   the language of the proposed amendment shall be unambiguous and consistent with applicable law and with the provisions of the bylaws that are not proposed to be amended, and if not in such condition shall be revised to satisfy that requirement.  Upon satisfaction of this requirement, the amendment shall be mailed, hand-delivered or, if the bylaws permit, electronically delivered, together with the notice of the meeting to the association membership at least 10 days prior to the meeting; (d)   if permitted by the association's bylaws, the notice of the meeting shall include a proxy ballot or absentee ballot with instructions for the return of same, which instructions shall permit facsimile or electronic mail delivery of the proxy ballot or absentee ballot to the association and shall not require receipt of the proxy or absentee ballot more than one business day prior to the meeting; (e)   if a sufficient number of ballots or proxies are not received at the special or annual meeting to conclusively determine that the proposed amendment has been approved or rejected, the meeting shall be adjourned for a period of 30 days, or such longer period as approved by the association membership by approval of a motion to extend the vote concerning the amendment, but in no event for longer than 11 months from when the notice of the meeting was sent, and all proxies or ballots received prior to the extended date shall remain valid if otherwise valid under the terms of the bylaws; and (f)   when an amendment is approved, a copy of the approved amendment shall be provided to all association members, and the association shall promptly record the  amendment in the county recording office where the bylaws were recorded. (3)   Paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not be construed to require a vote to be held on an amendment to the bylaws that has been voted on in the preceding 12 months of the initial meeting request, made pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of this subsection. (4)   For the purposes of paragraph (2) of this subsection, the number of total authorized votes in the association shall be based on the whole number of units owned by someone entitled to association membership  after subtracting those  association members who are ineligible to vote because they are not in good standing. (5)   An executive board shall not amend the bylaws of an association without a vote of the association members open to all association members, as provided in the association's bylaws, or where the bylaws provide for no method of their amendment by a vote of the association members, or only allow association members to amend the bylaws through a majority vote exceeding a two-thirds majority, then an association shall only amend the bylaws pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, except an executive board may amend the bylaws under the following circumstances: (a)   to the extent necessary to render the bylaws consistent with State, federal or local law; or (b)   after providing notice to all association members of the proposed amendment, which notice shall include a ballot to reject the proposed amendment.  Other than an amendment to render the bylaws consistent with State, federal, or local law, if at least 10 percent of association members vote to reject the amendment within 30 days of its mailing, the amendment shall be deemed defeated. e.     Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.) to the contrary, all bylaws and association documents of an association shall comply with the minimum requirements of sections 16 and 18 of P.L.      , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for such documents, or shall be deemed to include such provisions by incorporation through this section. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.7) 40.  Section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  Upon the sale of 20 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests to be created in the community, the developer shall arrange for the members of the association to hold an election for an owners coordinating council, which group shall be comprised of at least three owners other than the developer.  The council shall be a steering committee for owners complaints and to provide guidance to the developer and association on issues of importance to the owners.  In addition, the council shall coordinate the elections to the association governing board when owners may be elected to that board in accordance with this section, and shall serve as the owners finance committee during the period of developer control.  All elections to this group shall comply with election guidelines to be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.       , c. (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that only members elected by the unit owners, other than the developer or developers appointees to the governing board, shall serve on the council, and the council's decisions shall be free of any control by the developer or any member of the governing board appointed by the developer.  Any vacancies on the council shall be filled within 30 days by current council members, and in the case of any tie votes by such council members, by the vote of the unit owners other than the developer within 60 days after the vacancy occurs. Irrespective of the time set for developer control of the association provided in the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, or other instruments of creation, control of the voting interests of the governing board of the association shall be surrendered to the owners in the following manner: (1)   Sixty days after conveyance of 25 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, not fewer than 25 percent of the members of the [executive] governing board shall be elected by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, in accordance with election procedures to be promulgated by the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities. (2)   Sixty days after conveyance of 50 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, not fewer than 40 percent of the members of the [executive] governing board shall be elected by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable. (3)   Sixty days after conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units or interests, the developer's control of the [executive] governing board shall terminate, at which time the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, shall elect the entire [executive] governing board; except that the developer may retain the selection of one [executive] governing board member representing his interests as a unit owner so long as there are any units remaining unsold in the regular course of business.  The retention by the developer of one member on the governing board shall cease if no units remain which are being offered for sale to the public.  Unsold units converted to rental units by a developer shall create a presumption that the developer has ceased selling, and in that event, any tenant of a developer-owned unit shall be deemed to be a member of the association as if the tenant owns the unit. b.    The percentages specified in subsection a. of this section shall be calculated upon the basis of the whole number of units entitled to membership in the association.  The bylaws of the association shall specify the number or proportion of votes of all units conveyed to owners that shall be required for the election of executive board members.  Unless the bylaws provide for  an alternate approach to allocating votes pursuant to paragraph (9) of subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.2017, c.106 (C.45:22A-45.2), each unit conveyed to an owner shall be entitled to one vote regardless of the number of association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, residing in a unit.  A developer may surrender control of the executive board of the association before the time specified in subsection a. of this section, if the association members, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, agree by a majority vote to assume control. c.     Upon assumption by the owners of control of the [executive] voting interests of the governing board of the association, the developer shall deliver to the association all items and documents pertinent to the association, such as, but not limited to, a copy of the master deed, declaration of covenants and restrictions, documents of creation of the association, bylaws, minute book including all minutes, any rules and regulations, association funds and an accounting therefor, all personal property, insurance policies, government permits, a membership roster and all contracts and agreements relative to the association within 60 days of  that transition date, established pursuant to this section.  In addition, all similar items required to be turned over by a developer of a condominium pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-12.1) shall be required to be turned over by a developer of a shared ownership community to the association. d.    The association when controlled by the owners, and voting-eligible tenants where applicable, shall not take any action that would be detrimental to the sale of units by the developer, and shall continue the same level of maintenance, operation and services as immediately prior to their assumption of control, until the last unit is sold. e.     From the time of conveyance of 75 percent of the lots, parcels, units, or interests, until the last lot, parcel, unit, or interest in the development is conveyed in the ordinary course of business, the master deed, bylaws or declaration of covenants and restrictions shall not require that more than 75 percent of the votes entitled to be cast thereon be cast in the affirmative for a change in the bylaws or regulations of the association. f.     The developer shall not be permitted to cast any votes allocated to unsold lots, parcels, units, or interests, in order to amend the master deed, bylaws, or any other document, for the purpose of changing the permitted use of a lot, parcel, unit, or interest, or for the purpose of reducing the common elements or facilities. g.    If the council of owners authorized in subsection a. of this section is established and there has been substantial completion of the common elements and public improvements in any phase of the shared ownership community which are not covered by the performance or maintenance guarantees posted with any governmental agencies having jurisdiction, the council shall request the association to cause such common elements and improvements to be inspected and evaluated for compliance with the developer's warranty and construction obligations, with the assistance of qualified independent engineering and legal consultants selected by the council.  The fees for such consultants shall be paid from funds contributed by the developer. (1)   Public improvements to be dedicated to any governmental entity shall be exempt from any direct warranty or construction defect claims by the association or the unit owners other than the developer.  Acceptance of any such public improvements by the governmental entity to which they are to be dedicated shall be deemed conclusive evidence that such improvements have been satisfactorily completed and the developer shall have no further obligation with respect to those improvements, either to the association, to any unit owners other than the developer, or to any governmental agency having jurisdiction. (2)   Within 120 days after the association's receipt of any request for inspection of any phase of the completed common elements or other improvements, the council shall require its engineering consultant to inspect the particular completed improvements and render a written evaluation of them to the council.  A copy of the final report, following the councils review of the initial evaluation, shall be furnished to the developer within 30 days after the committee's receipt of the report.  Thereafter, the council and the developer shall conduct one or more joint inspections of the common elements and other improvements covered by the request and pursue good faith negotiations to resolve any warranty or construction defect claims against the developer.  All fees and related expenses incurred by the council for engineering and legal consultants shall be paid promptly by the association from available designated funds. (3)   If a settlement agreement is finalized between the council and the developer, the developer-controlled executive board shall have the authority to execute an agreement and to release the declarant from all liability with respect to the completed common elements and improvements, subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the agreement.  Any such settlement agreement and release shall be legally binding upon the association and the unit owners, provided that its form is approved by the independent legal counsel retained by the council on behalf of the association. (4)   If no settlement agreement is approved by the council within 180 days after the request for inspection, the parties shall be obligated to proceed to mediation within 30 days thereafter in accordance with section 10 of P.L.       , c.      (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  If no settlement is reached through mediation within 15 days after commencement of same, then the parties shall promptly proceed to non-binding arbitration of any remaining issues in accordance with rules promulgated by the director.  Such mediation and non-binding arbitration shall be conditions precedent to any litigation of the warranty and construction defect claims against the developer.  All professional fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the association with regard to the mediation or arbitration, or both, shall be borne by the owners, including the developer, in the same manner as common expenses are allocated and paid by the association promptly upon the receipt of written authorization of the council. (5)   In the event that no settlement agreement and releases are executed with respect to any completed common elements or improvements during the period of developer control of the governing board of the association, any statutes of limitation or repose applicable to that association concerning common elements, including, but not limited to statutory warranties, shall be extended for a period of one year after the assumption of control of the governing board by owners other than the developer. (6)   The procedures set forth in this section shall also apply to and be binding upon the developer and the association after the unit owners, other than the developer, assume control of the governing board of the association; provided, however, that the governing board after that transition shall not be bound by the recommendations of the council of owners.  The governing board controlled by the owners may vote to abolish the council of owners at any time after the owners have assumed control of the governing board. (cf: P.L.2017, c.106, s.8) 41.  Section 6 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-48) is amended to read as follows: 6.    The [Commissioner of Community Affairs] Commission on Shared Ownership Communities shall cause to be prepared and distributed, for the use and guidance of associations, [executive] governing boards and [administrators] professionals hired by such boards to assist them, explanatory materials and guidelines to assist them in achieving proper and timely compliance with the requirements of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et al.) and with the requirements of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Such guidelines may include the text of model bylaw provisions suggested or recommended for adoption. The commission shall also make available, on an Internet web site maintained by it, descriptions of the outcomes of dispute resolution procedures overseen by the commission, indexed by subject matter. The commission shall publish a quarterly newsletter to be furnished to any member of any association requesting it and shall also publish the newsletter electronically for viewing on the Internet. [Failure or refusal of an association or executive board to make proper amendment or supplementation of its bylaws prior to the effective date of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et al.) shall not, however, affect their obligation of compliance therewith on and after that effective date.] Any owner or tenant of an owner in a shared ownership community may seek the assistance of the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities pursuant to section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to address the failure of an association to make proper amendment or supplementation of its bylaws in order to comply with any statutory requirements. (cf: P.L.1993, c.30, s.6) 42.  Section 14 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  The association, acting through its officers or governing board, shall be responsible for the performance of the following duties, the costs of which shall be common expenses: (a)   The maintenance, repair, replacement, cleaning and sanitation of the common elements. (b)   The assessment and collection of funds for common expenses and the payment thereof. (c)   The adoption, distribution, amendment and enforcement of rules governing the use and operation of the condominium and the condominium property and the use of the common elements, including but not limited to the imposition of reasonable fines, assessments and late fees upon unit owners, if authorized by the master deed or bylaws, subject to the right of a majority of unit owners to change any such rules. (d)   The maintenance of insurance against loss by fire or other casualties normally covered under broad-form fire and extended coverage insurance policies as written in this State, covering all common elements and all structural portions of the condominium property and the application of the proceeds of any such insurance to restoration of such common elements and structural portions[ if such restoration shall otherwise be required under the provisions of this act or the master deed or bylaws]. (e)   The maintenance of insurance against liability for personal injury and death for accidents occurring within the common elements whether limited or general and the defense of any actions brought by reason of injury or death to person, or damage to property occurring within such common elements and not arising by reason of any act or negligence of any individual unit owner. (f)   The master deed or bylaws may require the association to protect blanket mortgages, or unit owners and their mortgagees, as their respective interest may appear, under the policies of insurance provided under clauses (d) and (e) of this section, or against such risks with respect to any or all units, and may permit the assessment and collection from a unit owner of specific charges for insurance coverage applicable to his unit.

(i)    Such other duties as may be set forth in the master deed or bylaws. (j)    An association shall exercise its powers and discharge its functions in a manner that protects and furthers or is not inconsistent with the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the community. (k)   An association shall provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of [housing-related] disputes between individual unit owners and the association, and between unit owners, which shall be readily available as an alternative to litigation.  Any costs associated with the procedure shall be borne by the association as a common expense, and no costs shall be assessable against any individual owner or owners.  A person other than an officer of the association, a member of the governing board or a unit owner involved in the dispute shall be made available to resolve the dispute.  [A unit owner may notify the Commissioner of Community Affairs if an association does not comply with this subsection.  The commissioner shall have the power to order the association to provide a fair and efficient procedure for the resolution of disputes] A unit owner who has availed himself of the dispute resolution procedures provided by his association, but who does not consider the matter resolved, may file a request for dispute resolution services with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities, established pursuant to section 5 of P.L. , c.     (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).

(cf: P.L.1969, c.257, s.12) 44.  Section 2 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-12.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  [When] For associations formed prior to the effective date of P.L.       , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when unit owners other than the developer own 25% or more of the units in a condominium that will be operated ultimately by an association, the unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect not less than 25% of the members of the governing board or other form of administration of the association.  Unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect not less than 40% of the members of the governing board or other form of administration upon the conveyance of 50% of the units in a condominium.  Unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect all of the members of the governing board or other form of administration upon the conveyance of 75% of the units in a condominium. However, when some of the units of a condominium have been conveyed to purchasers and none of the others are being constructed or offered for sale by the developer in the ordinary course of business, the unit owners other than the developer shall be entitled to elect all of the members of the governing board or other form of administration. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of subsection a of this section, the developer shall be entitled to elect at least one member of the governing board  or other form of administration of an association as long as the developer  holds for sale in the ordinary course of business one or more units in a  condominium operated by the association. b.    Within 30 days after the unit owners other than the developer are entitled to elect a member or members of the governing board or other form of administration of an association, the association shall call, and give not less than 20 days' nor more than 30 days' notice of, a meeting of the unit owners to elect the members of the governing board or other form of administration.  The meeting may be called and the notice given by any unit owner if the association fails to do so. c.     If a developer holds one or more units for sale in the ordinary course of business, none of the following actions may be taken without approval in writing by the developer: (1)   Assessment of the developer as a unit owner for capital improvements. (2)   Any action by the association that would be detrimental to the sales of units by the developer. However, an increase in assessments for common expenses without discrimination against the developer shall not be deemed to be detrimental to the sales of units. On or after the after the effective date of P.L.     , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), elections for and control of a governing board of an association shall be in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47). d.    [Prior to, or not more than 60 days after, the time that unit owners other than the developer elect a majority of the members of the governing board  or other form of administration of an association, the developer shall relinquish control of the association, and the unit owners shall accept control.  Simultaneously,] When control of an association is required to be relinquished by a developer pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), the developer shall deliver to the association all property of the unit owners and of the association held or controlled by the developer, including, but not limited to, the following items, if applicable, as to each condominium operated by the association: (1)   A photocopy of the master deed and all amendments thereto, certified by affidavit of the developer, or an officer or agent of the developer, as being a complete copy of the actual master deed.

(11)  Insurance policies. (12) Copies of any certificates of occupancy which may have been issued for the condominium property. (13)  Any other permits issued by governmental bodies applicable to the condominium property in force or issued within 1 year prior to the date the unit owners other than the developer take control of the association.

(18)  All other contracts to which the association is a party. (cf: P.L.1979, c.157, s.2) 45.  Section 15 of P.L.1979, c.157 (C.46:8B-15) is amended to read as follows: 15.  Subject to the provisions of the master deed, the bylaws, rules and regulations and the provisions of this act or other applicable law, the association shall have the following powers: (a)   Whether or not incorporated, the association shall be an entity which shall act through its officers and may enter into contracts, bring suit and be sued.  If the association is not incorporated, it may be deemed to be an entity existing pursuant to this act and a majority of the members of the governing board or of the association, as the case may be, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  Process may be served upon the association by serving any officer of the association or by serving the agent designated for service of process.  Service of process upon the association shall not constitute service of process upon any individual unit owner. (b)   The association shall have access to each unit from time to time during reasonable hours as may be necessary for the maintenance, repair or replacement of any common elements therein or accessible therefrom or for making emergency repairs necessary to prevent damage to common elements or to any other unit or units.  The association may charge the unit owner for the repair of any common element damaged by the unit owner or his tenant. (c)   The association may purchase units in the condominium and otherwise acquire, hold, lease, mortgage and convey the same.  It may also lease or license the use of common elements in a manner not inconsistent with the rights of unit owners. (d)   The association may acquire or enter into agreements whereby it acquires leaseholds, memberships or other possessory or use interests in lands or facilities including, but not limited to country clubs, golf courses, marinas and other recreational facilities, whether or not contiguous to the condominium property, intended to provide for the enjoyment, recreation or other use or benefit of the unit owners.  If fully described in the master deed or bylaws, the fees, costs and expenses of acquiring, maintaining, operating, repairing and replacing any such memberships, interests and facilities shall be common expenses.  If not so described in the master deed or bylaws as originally recorded, no such membership interest or facility shall be acquired except pursuant to amendment of or supplement to the master deed or bylaws duly adopted as provided therein and in this act.  In the absence of such amendment or supplement, if some but not all unit owners desire any such acquisition and agree to assume among themselves all costs of acquisition, maintenance, operation, repair and replacement thereof, the association may acquire or enter into an agreement to acquire the same as limited common elements appurtenant only to the units of those unit owners who have agreed to bear the costs and expenses thereof.  Such costs and expenses shall be assessed against and collected from the agreeing unit owners in the proportions in which they share as among themselves in the common expenses in the absence of some other unanimous agreement among themselves. No other unit owner shall be charged with any such cost or expense; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the extension of the interests in such limited common elements to additional unit owners by subsequent agreement with all those unit owners then having an interest in such limited common elements. (e)   The association may levy and collect assessments duly made by the association for a share of common expenses [or otherwise], including any other moneys duly owed the association, upon proper notice to the appropriate unit owner, together with interest thereon, late fees and reasonable attorneys' fees, if authorized by the master deed or bylaws. All funds collected by an association shall be maintained separately in the association's name. For investment purposes only, reserve funds may be commingled with operating funds of the association. Commingled operating and reserve funds shall be accounted for separately, and a commingled account shall not, at any time, be less than the amount identified as reserve funds.  A manager or business entity managing a condominium, or an agent, employee, officer, or director of an association, shall not commingle any association funds with his or her funds or with the funds of any other condominium association or the funds of another association as defined in section 3 of P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-23). [If] Other than during the period of developer control as set forth in section 5 of P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-47), if authorized by the master deed or bylaws, the association may levy and collect a capital contribution, membership fee or other charge upon the [initial sale or subsequent] resale of a unit, which collection shall be earmarked for the purpose of maintenance of or improvements to common elements to defray common expenses [or otherwise], provided that such charge shall not exceed nine times the amount of the most recent monthly common expense assessment for that unit. (f)   If authorized by the master deed or bylaws, the association may impose reasonable fines upon unit owners for failure to comply with provisions of the master deed, bylaws or rules and regulations, subject to the following provisions: A fine for a violation or a continuing violation of the master deed, bylaws or rules and regulations shall not exceed [the maximum monetary penalty permitted to be imposed for a violation or a continuing violation under section 19 of the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-19)] $50 per violation per day , or a total of $2,500 for continuing violations. On roads or streets with respect to which Title 39 of the Revised Statutes is in effect under section 1 of P.L.1945, c.284 (C.39:5A-1), an association may not impose fines for moving automobile violations. A fine shall not be imposed unless the association has filed the required information with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and the unit owner is given written notice of the action taken and of the alleged basis for the action, and is advised of the right to participate in a dispute resolution procedure in accordance with subsection (k) of section 14 of P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-14), and advised of the further right to file an appeal with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities.  A unit owner who does not believe that the dispute resolution procedure has satisfactorily resolved the matter shall not be prevented from seeking dispute resolution with the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities in the manner provided under section 5 of P.L.       , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or from seeking a judicial remedy in a court of competent jurisdiction, in which case the filing of a lien for any fine imposed shall be postponed until a final determination has been made concerning the fine by either the commission or the court. (g)   Such other powers as may be set forth in the master deed or bylaws, if not prohibited by P.L.1969, c.257 (C.46:8B-1 et seq.) or any other law of this State. (cf: P.L.2007, c.165, s.1) 46.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT It has been more than 40 years since the Legislature enacted "The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act," (PREDFDA), P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.) to provide State oversight of the marketing of planned developments to prospective purchasers, through a review of documents and advertisements, as well as requiring that certain disclosures be made by a developer to a buyer. Marketing techniques are important because membership in a homeowner association is mandatory for a purchaser of a home in community which has shared property and facilities, such as a condominium, cooperative, or a single family home in a planned development.  The shared property of such communities is owned collectively by all of the individual home purchasers.  These communities are referred to as shared ownership communities in the bill and are often known as common interest communities. It has also been more than 10 years since the Assembly Task Force to Study Homeowners Associations released its report containing more than 30 recommendations calling for changes in the laws, in order to provide more protections for homeowners.  This bill addresses most of those recommendations, as well as updating the laws requiring disclosure by developers and clarifying the powers and obligations of governing boards of associations and the rights of owners living in such communities. The bill revises the manner in which information should be provided prospective purchasers through the Public Offering Statement, (POS) a document required to be provided to prospective purchasers by developers of such communities.  Although New Jerseys statutes require certain disclosures by a developer during the sales phase of shared ownership communities, these disclosures have too often been inadequate to properly inform prospective purchasers.  Items which are likely to be of extreme importance to a purchaser, such as obligations, governance structures, potential future liabilities, restrictions, or, even in some cases, hidden loans on the part of a developer to the association, may be buried deep within the document, and not disclosed adequately, if at all.  The sheer volume of information, which varies widely by developers on matters which could be standardized, also hinders adequate review by the State. The bill requires the POS, and the registration of developments process, to be revised and streamlined.  A developer will be required to submit information on standardized forms and in an electronic format.  Governance structures will be standardized and developers allowed to highlight variations that they wish to apply.  Processing times for registrations of developments will be reduced under the bill from 90 to 45 days for standardized submissions.  The information in the Public Offering Statement to be disclosed to a prospective purchaser will be revised to be quickly accessed by the reader, as well as indexed under logical headings, such as pets, parking, restrictions and fees.  An executive summary of the offering is required to be made in plain language, explaining the rights, liabilities, obligations and governing form applicable to the association. The bill also addresses the problem that planned communities with fewer than 100 units have been exempted from registration under the act.  This has been interpreted by the administering agency as exempting developers from providing a POS, thus providing no protections for purchasers in smaller communities.  The exemption has also been extended by regulations to all low and moderate income (Mount Laurel) communities of any size.  Exemption from the PREDFDA also clouds many other issues, such as when a developer of a planned community must turn over the assets to the homeowners.  The bill removes these exemptions, and requires a Public Offering Statement for every prospective purchaser in a planned community.  The regressive flat rate development charge currently charged to developers of planned communities is replaced under the bill with a per unit fee of 3/100 of one percent (.0003) of the sales price.  These fees are currently required to be used to defray the costs of the States review under the statute, and will continue to be used for that purpose, as well as to offset costs for other homeowner protections added by the bill.  The change from a flat rate fee to a per unit fee will result in lower fees on lower priced homes, and in most instances will result in decreased fees being paid per development than is the case now. In addition, the bill addresses problems which arise in what may be termed the governance stage of a homeowners association.  After the developer has sold at least 75 percent of the homes planned for the community, total control of the management of the commonly-owned property is transferred from the developer to the home owners in the community.  Experience shows that owners are not adequately prepared for this event. The bill allows owners to have earlier exposure to operational issues and input into governance matters, as well as requires boards to adopt principles of democratic and transparent governance.  The bill requires the creation of an owners coordinating council in each association, consisting of at least three owners, during the time period that the developer controls the voting interest of the association governing board.  The owners coordinating council will function as a steering committee for owners, and serve as the election monitor when owners other than the developer are entitled by statute to be elected as voting members of the governing board.  In addition, the owners council will be permitted to bring claims to a commission formed under the bill, on matters affecting construction deficiencies in the common elements during the period of developer control. The inability of owners to file warranty claims concerning defects in common elements was found to be a problem by the State Commission of Investigation in its report of abuses in the new home construction industry. The bill addresses the inconsistency in various statutes affecting owners rights in different types of shared ownership communities, by amending the laws to eliminate these inconsistencies. The bill creates a commission in, but not of, the Department of Law and Public Safety, to serve as a State resource center, liaison and educational resource to owners and their shared ownership community associations, and to coordinate low cost, reliable alternative dispute resolution (ADR) services to these associations.  The commission will also serve as a hearing entity concerning violations of statutory law pertaining to associations. The commission is modeled after a very successful program created by Montgomery County, Maryland for homeowner associations under its jurisdiction. The bill addresses a critical need of the many owners whose associations have not provided any ADR or ADR which is not impartial.  Many associations have adopted a process too biased or expensive to serve as a viable alternative to litigation.  Because associations can charge each owner the cost of the boards attorney as a common expense, many boards are quick to invite litigation, rather than amicably resolve disputes.  In some instances, even when a boards actions blatantly violate bylaws, or are flagrantly illegal, State and local officials are often unwilling or unable to get involved, citing the private nature of such communities.  This places an undue financial burden on individual owners, many of whom are senior citizens on fixed incomes. The bill also addresses the general lack of information about community associations, and a lack of standards for the manner in which they may operate.  The commission created by the bill and the State entity responsible for oversight of marketing of new homes is charged with creating a booklet providing detailed information to owners concerning general information, State and federal laws, resources available, and the standards of governance established for association governing boards.  The commission will also be responsible for posting the information to a web site. The commission is also required under the bill to promulgate standards for transparent and democratic governance in the operation of shared ownership communities.  The standards may be more specific than the provisions of the bill, but must comport with the Legislatures intent to foster open, democratic processes in such communities. The funding for the activities of the commission and the alternative dispute resolution services will come from fees already collected and earmarked for protections of owners under the "The Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act."  The bill requires that all associations provide certain information annually to the Commission on Shared Ownership Communities.  There is no fee to file under the bill, but those associations that do not provide the information will not be eligible as qualified private communities to seek reimbursement from their municipality for services provided to them, such as trash, leaf and snow removal, and, in addition, will not be permitted to impose fines upon members, or to receive approval to file liens based on fines imposed. In order to recognize the governmental nature of homeowners associations, and to provide the best enforcement of statutory protections for prospective homebuyers in shared ownership communities, the bill moves the responsibility for the The Planned Real Estate Development Act to a new bureau within the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety, to be known as the Bureau of Homebuyers Protection.  The Division of Consumer Affairs currently has significant experience in administering consumer protection programs; for example it has the responsibility for overseeing the Home Improvement Contractors Registration Act and the consumer fraud act.  In addition, relocating homebuyer protections will help to minimize conflicts of interests concerning builders under other programs in the Department of Community Affairs, such as its role as the enforcer of construction codes, licensing of code inspectors, and overseeing the New Home Warranty Program.
