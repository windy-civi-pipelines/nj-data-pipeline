(6)  For a record or other document containing a home address required to be redacted pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2021, c.371 (C.47:1B-2) that, because of the characteristics or properties of the record or document, is only available to be viewed in person, a custodian or other government official shall make every reasonable effort to hide such address when allowing an individual without authority to view such address as unredacted to view the record or document. b.  Nothing in this act shall be construed to require redaction or nondisclosure of any information in any document, record, information, or database shared with or otherwise provided to any other government entity. c.  Information otherwise subject to redaction or nondisclosure pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2021, c.371 (C.47:1B-2) may be provided as unredacted upon order of a judge of the Superior Court or of any other court of competent jurisdiction. d.  This section shall not be construed to require a record to be made available that is not otherwise required to be made available under any other law or regulation. e.  The Director of the Division of Taxation may issue any guidance, guidelines, or rules and regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.371, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, certain public officials and employees, such as judges and law enforcement officers, are entitled to have their personal information redacted or subject to nondisclosure when such information is present on a public record.  However, there are certain exceptions when an individuals personal information may still be disclosed, even if they are otherwise entitled to redaction or nondisclosure. This bill would add reports required to be filed with the Election Law Enforcement Commission regarding election-related financing to the list of current exceptions.  This exception would apply to all reports filed by any individual, candidate, campaign, committee, or other entity under The New Jersey Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Reporting Act.
