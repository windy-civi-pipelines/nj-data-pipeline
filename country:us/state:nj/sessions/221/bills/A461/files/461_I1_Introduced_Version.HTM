<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      </span>1.   R.S.39:3-4
is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     39:3-4.  Except as hereinafter
provided, every resident of this State and every nonresident whose automobile
or motorcycle shall be driven in this State shall, before using the vehicle on
the public highways, register the same, and an automobile or motorcycle shall
not be driven unless so registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Registration shall be made in
the following manner: An application in writing, signed by the applicant or by
an agent or officer, in case the applicant is a corporation, shall be made to
the chief administrator or the chief administrator's agent, on forms prepared
and supplied by the chief administrator, containing the name, street address of
the residence or the business of the owner, mailing address, if different from
the street address of the owner's residence or business, and age of the owner,
together with a description of the character of the automobile or motorcycle,
including the name of the maker and the vehicle identification number, or the
manufacturer's number or the number assigned by the chief administrator if the
vehicle does not have a vehicle identification number, and any other statement
that may be required by the chief administrator.  A post office box shall
appear on the application only as part of a mailing address that is submitted
by the owner, agent or officer, as the case may be, in addition to the street
address of the applicant's residence or business; provided, however, the chief
administrator, upon application, shall permit a person who was a victim of a
violation of section 1 of P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10), N.J.S.2C:14-2, or
P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.), or who the chief administrator otherwise
determines to have good cause, to use as a mailing address a post office box,
an address other than the applicant's address or other contact point.  An owner
whose last address appears on the records of the commission as a post office
box shall change the owner's address on the owner's application for renewal to
the street address of the owner's residence or business and, if different from
the owner's street address, the owner's mailing address unless the chief
administrator has determined, pursuant to this section, that the owner may use
a post office box, an address other than the owner's address or other contact
point as a mailing address.  The application shall contain the name of the
insurer of the vehicle and the policy number.  If the vehicle is a leased motor
vehicle, the application shall make note of that fact and shall include along
with the name and street address of the lessor the name, street address, and
driver license number of the lessee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Thereupon the chief
administrator shall have the power to grant a registration certificate to the
owner of any motor vehicle, if over 17 years of age, application for the
registration having been properly made and the fee therefor paid, and the
vehicle being of a type that complies with the requirements of this Title.  The
form and contents of the registration certificate to be issued shall be
determined by the chief administrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the vehicle is a leased
motor vehicle, the registration certificate shall, in addition to containing
the name and street address of the lessor, identify the vehicle as a leased
motor vehicle. The chief administrator may send the registration certificate
directly to the lessee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The chief administrator shall
maintain a record of all registration certificates issued, and of the contents
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every registration shall
expire and the registration certificate thereof become void on the registrant's
numerical calendar day of birth in the 12th calendar month following the
calendar month in which the certificate was issued; except that the
registration shall expire on the last day of the 12th calendar month following
the calendar month in which the certificate was issued if the numerical
calendar day of the registrant's birth does not correspond to a numerical
calendar day in that month or if the vehicle is a leased motor vehicle<u><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>, unless the registrant is an active duty member of
any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, or a person in the
members immediate family, in which case the registration for a passenger
automobile shall remain valid beyond the expiration date, in accordance with
the provisions of section 1 of P.L.2015, c.299 (C.39:3-11.5a)</span></u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The chief administrator may,
at the chief administrator's discretion, require registrations which shall
expire, and issue certificates thereof which shall become void, on a date fixed
by him, which date shall not be sooner than three months nor later than 26
months after the date of issuance of the certificates, and the fees for the
registrations, including any other fees or charges collected in connection with
the registration fee, shall be fixed by the chief administrator in amounts
proportionately less or greater than the fees established by law. The chief
administrator may fix the expiration date for registration certificates at a
date other than 12 months if the chief administrator determines that the change
is necessary, appropriate or convenient in order to aid in implementing the
vehicle inspection requirements of chapter 8 of Title 39 or for other good
cause.  The chief administrator may, for good cause extend a registration
beyond the expiration date that appears upon the registration certificate for
periods not to exceed 12 additional months.  The chief administrator may extend
the expiration date of a registration without payment of a proportionate fee
when the chief administrator determines that the extension is necessary for
good cause.  If any registration is so extended, the owner shall pay upon
renewal the full registration fee for the period fixed by the chief administrator
as if no extension had been granted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of law to the contrary, every registration for new passenger
automobiles shall expire and the registration certificate shall become void on
the registrant's numerical calendar day of birth in the 48th calendar month
following the calendar month in which the certificate was initially issued;
except that the registration shall expire on the last day of the 48th calendar
month following the calendar month in which the certificate was initially
issued if the numerical calendar day of the registrant's birth does not
correspond to a numerical calendar day in that month<u>, unless the registrant
is an active duty member of any branch of the Armed Forces of the United
States, or a person in the members immediate family, in which case the
registration shall remain valid beyond the expiration date, in accordance with
the provisions of section 1 of P.L.2015, c.299 (C.39:3-11.5a)</u>.</p>
