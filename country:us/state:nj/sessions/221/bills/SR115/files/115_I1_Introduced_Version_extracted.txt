STATEMENT On October 7, 2023, just after the 50th anniversary of the start of the multi-front 1973 Yom Kippur War against Israel, the terrorist organization Hamas carried out a brutal attack against the Jewish people and the State of Israel.  The attack began in the early morning when Hamas launched thousands of rockets from the Gaza Strip that reached as far as Tel Aviv and the outskirts of Jerusalem, and then infiltrated Israeli towns and army bases in the south, including a gathering of young people at a music festival.  The armed terrorists launched a coordinated strike arriving in boats, paragliders, motorcycles, and other vehicles. News reports, survivor accounts, images, and videos from the scenes of this horrific attack show that Hamas terrorists slaughtered ordinary civilians and entire families, including babies and elderly people, set houses on fire, raped women, and took hostages. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, 1,200 people were confirmed dead in Israel, including American citizens, and another 3,400 were injured.  The October 7th attack was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in modern history, resulting in more Jews killed that day than on any single day since the Holocaust. On October 7th, Hamas took 251 men, women, and children hostage from Israel into Gaza, including American citizens, and kept them in inhumane and torturous conditions, including in cramped underground tunnels, since their kidnapping.  One of the American hostages taken into captivity by Hamas, Edan Alexander, is a resident of Tenafly, New Jersey, and is still being held in captivity.  Hamas has executed many of these hostages, including six individuals who were shot at close range on August 29, 2024 as Israeli Defense Forces approached their location.  Israeli authorities believe that 101 of the hostages who were kidnapped on October 7th remain in captivity, and it is believed that only 64 individuals remain alive. The October 7th terror attack prompted a defensive war against Hamas by the Israeli Defense Forces.  Many thousands of innocent Palestinian civilians have been wounded and killed by Israeli strikes targeting Hamas leaders, militants, and command and control positions.  A large percentage of Palestinian civilians have been displaced and are now living in makeshift shelters with limited access to food, clean water, and medical care.  The suffering and death which has occurred as a result of the October 7th attacks are tragic and horrific. It is therefore fitting and proper for New Jersey to commemorate the anniversary of the October 7th attack by Hamas against Israel, to mourn the lives that were lost as a result, condemn any and all acts of terrorism, stand in solidarity with the people of Israel and the Palestinian people, call for the release of all hostages, and support efforts seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
