Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  Subject to the availability of federal funds provided or made accessible to the State from the Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund, established pursuant to the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub.L.117-2, or any other federal funds provided or made accessible to the State in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, $1,300,000,000 from such federal funds shall be made available to the Department of Environmental Protection for the purposes set forth in subsection b. of this section. b.    (1) The funds made available to the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be reserved by the department to provide financial support, in conjunction with the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank and pursuant to the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Financing Program, for lead service line replacement projects undertaken by suppliers of water in the State.  The department may use not more than one percent of the funds to defray any administrative expenses incurred in the implementation of this section. (2)   The use of federal funds for the purposes specified in this subsection shall be conditioned upon the upfront provision of matching funds for each lead service line replacement project by the public water utility or other supplier of water undertaking the project, except when the project is being undertaken by a small water supplier, in which case, the small water supplier shall not be required to provide upfront matching funds, but may be required to commit to provide matching funds at some future date, as agreed to by the department in consultation with the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank.  To facilitate the provision of matching funds by suppliers of water, the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank is authorized to make loans to project sponsors for lead service line replacement projects undertaken by suppliers of water in the State.  The department, in consultation with the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, shall determine the amount of matching funds to be provided by each supplier of water pursuant to this paragraph and, when determining the amount, and the timeframe for provision, of matching funds by a small water supplier, shall consider the financial reserves held by the small water supplier and any other factors that would enable, or negate the ability of, the small water supplier to provide matching funds for the project.

STATEMENT This bill would provide that, subject to the availability of federal funds provided or made accessible to the State from the federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund, established pursuant to the federal American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub.L.117-2, or any other federal funds provided or made accessible to the State in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, $1.3 billion from such federal funds are to be made available to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
