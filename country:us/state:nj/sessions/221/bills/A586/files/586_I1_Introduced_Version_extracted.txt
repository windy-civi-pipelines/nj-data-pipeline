The bill would require the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to reserve a portion of the funding provided for the State Rental Assistance Program (SRAP) to establish and administer a program comparable to the federal section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program.  The federal section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program allows program participants, who would otherwise apply a voucher towards rent payments, to instead apply the voucher towards principal and interest on mortgage debt, insurance, taxes, utilities and other homeownership expenses. The bill would  require local housing authorities in the State that administer funding through the federal section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program to also implement the Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program.  Currently, local housing authorities are permitted, but not required, to implement this program. The bill would take effect on the first day of the sixth month following enactment in order to provide DCA and housing authorities time to prepare to implement the bills requirements.
