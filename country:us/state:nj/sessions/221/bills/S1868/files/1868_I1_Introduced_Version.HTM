All permits to carry handguns shall expire 2 years from the date of issuance or, in the case of an employee of an armored car company, upon termination of his employment by the company occurring prior thereto whichever is earlier in time, and they may thereafter be renewed every 2 years in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as in the case of original applications. b.    Application forms.     All applications for permits to carry handguns, and all applications for renewal of such permits, shall be made on the forms prescribed by the superintendent. Each application shall set forth the full name, date of birth, sex, residence, occupation, place of business or employment, and physical description of the applicant, and such other information as the superintendent may prescribe for the determination of the applicant's eligibility for a permit and for the proper enforcement of this chapter.  The application shall be signed by the applicant under oath, and shall be indorsed by three reputable persons who have known the applicant for at least 3 years preceding the date of application, and who shall certify thereon that the applicant is a person of good moral character and behavior. c.     Investigation and approval.   Each application shall in the first instance be submitted to the chief police officer of the municipality in which the applicant resides or to the county sheriff of the county in which the applicant resides, or to the superintendent, (1) if the applicant is an employee of an armored car company, or (2) if there is no chief police officer in the municipality where the applicant resides, or (3) if the applicant does not reside in this State. The chief police officer, the county sheriff, or the superintendent, as the case may be, shall cause the fingerprints of the applicant to be taken and compared with any and all records maintained by the municipality, the county in which it is located, the State Bureau of Identification and the Federal Bureau of Identification.  He shall also determine and record a complete description of each handgun the applicant intends to carry. No application shall be approved by the chief police officer, the county sheriff or the superintendent unless the applicant demonstrates that he is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in 2C:58-3c., that he is thoroughly familiar with  the safe handling and use of handguns, and that he has a justifiable need to  carry a handgun.  If the application is not approved by the chief police officer, county sheriff or the superintendent within 60 days of filing, it shall be deemed to  have been approved, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time in writing. d.    Issuance by Superior Court;  fee.    If the application has been approved by the chief police officer, county sheriff or the superintendent, as the case may be,  the applicant shall forthwith present it to the Superior Court of the county in which the applicant resides, or to the Superior Court in any county where he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of a nonresident or employee of an armored car company.  The court shall issue the permit to the applicant if, but only if, it is satisfied that the applicant is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in section 2C:58-3c., that he is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns, and that he has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.  The court may at its discretion issue a limited-type permit which would restrict the applicant as to the types of handguns he may carry and where and for what purposes such handguns may be carried.  At the time of issuance, the applicant shall pay to the county clerk of the county where the permit was issued a permit fee of [$20.00] $20. e.     Appeals from denial of applications.    Any person aggrieved by the denial by the chief police officer, the county sheriff or the superintendent of approval for a permit to carry a handgun may request a hearing in the Superior Court of the county in which he resides or in any county in which he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of a nonresident, by filing a written request for such a hearing within 30 days of the denial.  Copies of the request shall be served upon the superintendent, the county prosecutor and the chief police officer of the municipality or the county sheriff of the county where the applicant resides, as the case may be, if he is a resident of this State.  The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the filing of the request, and no formal pleading or filing fee shall be required.  Appeals from the determination at such a hearing shall be in accordance with law and the rules governing the courts of this State. If the superintendent, county sheriff or chief police officer approves an application and the Superior Court denies the application and refuses to issue a permit, the applicant may appeal such denial in accordance with law and the rules governing  the courts of this State. f.     Revocation of permits.    Any permit issued under this section shall be void at such time as the holder thereof becomes subject to any of the disabilities set forth in section 2C:58-3c., and the holder of such a void permit shall immediately surrender the permit to the superintendent who shall give notice to the licensing authority. Any permit may be revoked by the Superior Court, after hearing upon notice to the holder, if the court finds that the holder is no longer qualified for the issuance of such a permit.  The county prosecutor or county sheriff of any county, the chief police officer of any municipality, the superintendent or any citizen may apply to the court at any time for the revocation of any permit issued pursuant to  this section. (cf: P.L.1981, c.135, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides county sheriffs with the authority to issue firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase handguns, and provides them with authority to accept applications for permits to carry handguns. Under current law, a State resident applying for a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun must make such application to the chief law enforcement officer of an organized full-time police department of the municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State residents must make application to the superintendent.  The chief law enforcement officer, or superintendent, as the case may be, is tasked with taking fingerprints and initiating a criminal history records check on the applicant.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the applicant is issued the identification card or permit by the chief law enforcement officer or superintendent.  Under the provisions of this bill, county sheriffs are granted the same authority for State residents. In the instance of an application for a permit to carry a handgun, the initial application process is similar under current law.  An applicant must make application to the chief law enforcement officer of an organized full-time police department of the municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State residents and employees of armored trucks must make application to the superintendent.  Upon approval of the application by the chief law enforcement officer, or superintendent, the Superior Court issues the permit.  The bill provides county sheriffs with the authority to accept, investigate and approve or deny permit to carry applications for State residents.

Only one handgun shall be purchased or delivered on each permit and no more than one handgun shall be purchased within any 30-day period, but this limitation shall not apply to: (1)   a federal, State, or local law enforcement officer or agency purchasing handguns for use by officers in the actual performance of their law enforcement duties; (2)   a collector of handguns as curios or relics as defined in Title 18, United States Code, section 921 (a) (13) who has in his possession a valid Collector of Curios and Relics License issued by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; (3)   transfers of handguns among licensed retail dealers, registered wholesale dealers and registered manufacturers; (4)   transfers of handguns from any person to a licensed retail dealer or a registered wholesale dealer or registered manufacturer; (5)   any transaction where the person has purchased a handgun from a licensed retail dealer and has returned that handgun to the dealer in exchange for another handgun within 30 days of the original transaction, provided the retail dealer reports the exchange transaction to the superintendent; or (6)   any transaction where the superintendent issues an exemption from the prohibition in this subsection pursuant to the provisions of section 4 of P.L.2009, c.186 (C.2C:58-3.4). The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to afford or authorize any other exemption from the regulatory provisions governing firearms set forth in chapter 39 and chapter 58 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; A person shall not be restricted as to the number of rifles or shotguns he may purchase, provided he possesses a valid firearms purchaser identification card and provided further that he signs the certification required in subsection b. of this section for each transaction. j.     Firearms passing to heirs or legatees.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section concerning the transfer, receipt or acquisition of a firearm, a permit to purchase or a firearms purchaser identification card shall not be required for the passing of a firearm upon the death of an owner thereof to his heir or legatee, whether the same be by testamentary bequest or by the laws of intestacy.  The person who shall so receive, or acquire the firearm shall, however, be subject to all other provisions of this chapter. If the heir or legatee of the firearm does not qualify to possess or carry it, he may retain ownership of the firearm for the purpose of sale for a period not exceeding 180 days, or for a further limited period as may be approved by the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality or county sheriff of the county in which the heir or legatee resides or the superintendent, provided that the firearm is in the custody of the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality, county sheriff or the superintendent during that period. k.    Sawed-off shotguns. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the purchase or possession of any sawed-off shotgun. l.     Nothing in this section and in N.J.S.2C:58-2 shall apply to the sale or purchase of a visual distress signalling device approved by the United States Coast Guard, solely for possession on a private or commercial aircraft or any boat; provided, however, that no person under the age of 18 years shall purchase nor shall any person sell to a person under the age of 18 years a visual distress signalling device. m.   The provisions of subsections a. and b. of this section and paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:58-2 shall not apply to the purchase of firearms by a law enforcement agency for use by law enforcement officers in the actual performance of the officers' official duties, which purchase may be made directly from a manufacturer or from a licensed dealer located in this State or any other state (cf: P.L.2016, c.74, s.1) 2.    N.J.S.2C:58-4 is amended to read as follows: 2C:58-4.  a.  Scope and duration of authority.  Any person who holds a valid permit to carry a handgun issued pursuant to this section shall be authorized to carry a handgun in all parts of this State, except as prohibited by section 2C:39-5e.  One permit shall be sufficient for all handguns owned by the holder thereof, but the permit shall apply only to a handgun carried by the actual and legal holder of the permit. All permits to carry handguns shall expire 2 years from the date of issuance or, in the case of an employee of an armored car company, upon termination of his employment by the company occurring prior thereto whichever is earlier in time, and they may thereafter be renewed every 2 years in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as in the case of original applications. b.    Application forms.     All applications for permits to carry handguns, and all applications for renewal of such permits, shall be made on the forms prescribed by the superintendent. Each application shall set forth the full name, date of birth, sex, residence, occupation, place of business or employment, and physical description of the applicant, and such other information as the superintendent may prescribe for the determination of the applicant's eligibility for a permit and for the proper enforcement of this chapter.  The application shall be signed by the applicant under oath, and shall be indorsed by three reputable persons who have known the applicant for at least 3 years preceding the date of application, and who shall certify thereon that the applicant is a person of good moral character and behavior. c.     Investigation and approval.   Each application shall in the first instance be submitted to the chief police officer of the municipality in which the applicant resides or to the county sheriff of the county in which the applicant resides, or to the superintendent, (1) if the applicant is an employee of an armored car company, or (2) if there is no chief police officer in the municipality where the applicant resides, or (3) if the applicant does not reside in this State. The chief police officer, the county sheriff, or the superintendent, as the case may be, shall cause the fingerprints of the applicant to be taken and compared with any and all records maintained by the municipality, the county in which it is located, the State Bureau of Identification and the Federal Bureau of Identification.  He shall also determine and record a complete description of each handgun the applicant intends to carry. No application shall be approved by the chief police officer, the county sheriff or the superintendent unless the applicant demonstrates that he is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in 2C:58-3c., that he is thoroughly familiar with  the safe handling and use of handguns, and that he has a justifiable need to  carry a handgun.  If the application is not approved by the chief police officer, county sheriff or the superintendent within 60 days of filing, it shall be deemed to  have been approved, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time in writing. d.    Issuance by Superior Court;  fee.    If the application has been approved by the chief police officer, county sheriff or the superintendent, as the case may be,  the applicant shall forthwith present it to the Superior Court of the county in which the applicant resides, or to the Superior Court in any county where he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of a nonresident or employee of an armored car company.  The court shall issue the permit to the applicant if, but only if, it is satisfied that the applicant is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in section 2C:58-3c., that he is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns, and that he has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.  The court may at its discretion issue a limited-type permit which would restrict the applicant as to the types of handguns he may carry and where and for what purposes such handguns may be carried.  At the time of issuance, the applicant shall pay to the county clerk of the county where the permit was issued a permit fee of [$20.00] $20. e.     Appeals from denial of applications.    Any person aggrieved by the denial by the chief police officer, the county sheriff or the superintendent of approval for a permit to carry a handgun may request a hearing in the Superior Court of the county in which he resides or in any county in which he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of a nonresident, by filing a written request for such a hearing within 30 days of the denial.  Copies of the request shall be served upon the superintendent, the county prosecutor and the chief police officer of the municipality or the county sheriff of the county where the applicant resides, as the case may be, if he is a resident of this State.  The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the filing of the request, and no formal pleading or filing fee shall be required.  Appeals from the determination at such a hearing shall be in accordance with law and the rules governing the courts of this State. If the superintendent, county sheriff or chief police officer approves an application and the Superior Court denies the application and refuses to issue a permit, the applicant may appeal such denial in accordance with law and the rules governing  the courts of this State. f.     Revocation of permits.    Any permit issued under this section shall be void at such time as the holder thereof becomes subject to any of the disabilities set forth in section 2C:58-3c., and the holder of such a void permit shall immediately surrender the permit to the superintendent who shall give notice to the licensing authority. Any permit may be revoked by the Superior Court, after hearing upon notice to the holder, if the court finds that the holder is no longer qualified for the issuance of such a permit.  The county prosecutor or county sheriff of any county, the chief police officer of any municipality, the superintendent or any citizen may apply to the court at any time for the revocation of any permit issued pursuant to  this section. (cf: P.L.1981, c.135, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides county sheriffs with the authority to issue firearms purchaser identification cards and permits to purchase handguns, and provides them with authority to accept applications for permits to carry handguns. Under current law, a State resident applying for a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to purchase a handgun must make such application to the chief law enforcement officer of an organized full-time police department of the municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State residents must make application to the superintendent.  The chief law enforcement officer, or superintendent, as the case may be, is tasked with taking fingerprints and initiating a criminal history records check on the applicant.  Upon completion of the background investigation, the applicant is issued the identification card or permit by the chief law enforcement officer or superintendent.  Under the provisions of this bill, county sheriffs are granted the same authority for State residents. In the instance of an application for a permit to carry a handgun, the initial application process is similar under current law.  An applicant must make application to the chief law enforcement officer of an organized full-time police department of the municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State residents and employees of armored trucks must make application to the superintendent.  Upon approval of the application by the chief law enforcement officer, or superintendent, the Superior Court issues the permit.  The bill provides county sheriffs with the authority to accept, investigate and approve or deny permit to carry applications for State residents.
