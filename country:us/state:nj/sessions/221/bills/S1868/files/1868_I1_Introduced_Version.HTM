issued pursuant to this section shall be authorized to carry a handgun in all
parts of this State, except as prohibited by section 2C:39-5e.  One permit
shall be sufficient for all handguns owned by the holder thereof, but the
permit shall apply only to a handgun carried by the actual and legal holder of
the permit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All permits to carry handguns
shall expire 2 years from the date of issuance or, in the case of an employee
of an armored car company, upon termination of his employment by the company
occurring prior thereto whichever is earlier in time, and they may thereafter
be renewed every 2 years in the same manner and subject to the same conditions
as in the case of original applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Application forms.     All
applications for permits to carry handguns, and all applications for renewal of

Each application shall set forth the full name, date of birth, sex, residence,
occupation, place of business or employment, and physical description of the

the determination of the applicant's eligibility for a permit and for the
proper enforcement of this chapter.  The application shall be signed by the

to  carry a handgun.  If the application is not approved by the chief police

is not subject to any of the disabilities set forth in section 2C:58-3c., that
he is thoroughly familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns, and that
he has a justifiable need to carry a handgun.  The court may at its discretion
issue a limited-type permit which would restrict the applicant as to the types
of handguns he may carry and where and for what purposes such handguns may be
carried.  At the time of issuance, the applicant shall pay to the county clerk
of the county where the permit was issued a permit fee of <b><span

a handgun may request a hearing in the Superior Court of the county in which he
resides or in any county in which he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of
a nonresident, by filing a written request for such a hearing within 30 days of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides county
sheriffs with the authority to issue firearms purchaser identification cards
and permits to purchase handguns, and provides them with authority to accept
applications for permits to carry handguns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a State
resident applying for a firearms purchaser identification card or a permit to
purchase a handgun must make such application to the chief law enforcement
officer of an organized full-time police department of the municipality where
the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality
does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State residents must make
application to the superintendent.  The chief law enforcement officer, or
superintendent, as the case may be, is tasked with taking fingerprints and
initiating a criminal history records check on the applicant.  Upon completion
of the background investigation, the applicant is issued the identification card
or permit by the chief law enforcement officer or superintendent.  Under the
provisions of this bill, county sheriffs are granted the same authority for
State residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the instance of an
application for a permit to carry a handgun, the initial application process is
similar under current law.  An applicant must make application to the chief law
enforcement officer of an organized full-time police department of the
municipality where the applicant resides or the Superintendent of State Police
if the municipality does not have a full-time police force.  Out-of-State
residents and employees of armored trucks must make application to the
superintendent.  Upon approval of the application by the chief law enforcement
officer, or superintendent, the Superior Court issues the permit.  The bill
provides county sheriffs with the authority to accept, investigate and approve
or deny permit to carry applications for State residents.</p>
