<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A board of education
shall accept monetary donations from any person or entity for the purposes of
assisting students with the purchase of school breakfast or school lunch and
satisfying any arrears of school breakfast or school lunch bills of students
enrolled in the school district, unless the donation is otherwise precluded by
law or regulation. A board of education shall place the donations in a School
Meal Fund, which shall be established by the board of education for the sole
purpose of accepting donations to assist students enrolled in the district with
the purchase of school breakfast or school lunch and to satisfy any arrears of
school breakfast or school lunch bills.  The School Meal Fund shall be
established through the adoption of a resolution by the board of education. 
The fund shall be maintained under the jurisdiction of the board of education
and the supervision of the school business administrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     School Meal Fund moneys shall
be maintained in a separate bank account.  The fund shall be credited with any
donations made to the fund, any moneys allocated to the fund by the school
district, and any interest income that may be earned on the investment of
moneys in the fund.  The fund shall be reduced by all costs related to the
operation of the fund, including bank service fees and direct administrative
costs for the oversight and management of the fund.  Any funds remaining at the
end of the fiscal year shall be carried forward into subsequent fiscal years
and utilized solely for the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board of education
shall ensure, through the adoption of a board policy, that all financial and
bookkeeping controls are adequate to ensure appropriate fiscal accountability
of the fund.  The board policy shall also outline the standards that shall be
applied in making a determination to disburse funds from the School Meal Fund. 
The policy shall ensure equitable distribution of the funds that are
disbursed.  Disbursements from the fund shall be recorded showing the date,
purpose, and amount of the disbursement.  The fund shall be subject to audit as
part of the school districts annual audit conducted pursuant to
N.J.S.18A:23-1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The board of education
shall provide, through written and electronic means, information to the parents
and guardians of students enrolled in the school district and to other
residents of the school district and community organizations regarding the
board of educations obligation to accept donated funds for the purposes
established pursuant to subsection a. of this section and the procedures to be
followed to make a donation to the fund.  The information shall also be posted
in a prominent location on the school districts Internet website.  The
notification requirement shall not apply to school districts in which all
schools within the district have adopted the Community Eligibility Provision,
as that term is defined in subsection c. of P.L.2018, c.26 (C.18A:33-14.1), and
provide free school meals to all students enrolled in the district.</p>

posted in a prominent location on the school districts Internet website. 
Finally, the bill provides that the requirement to provide information to
parents and guardians will not apply to school districts in which all schools
within the district have adopted the Community Eligibility Provision and
