Relief Act, supplementing Title 38A of the New Jersey Statutes, and repealing
P.L.1979, c.317.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be referred to as the New Jersey Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that the civil and property rights of persons serving on active
duty in the Armed Forces of the United States and the New Jersey National Guard
should be maintained, secured, and protected as a matter of public policy of
this State.  Such rights should be protected by this State, at least, to the
extent that those rights are protected by federal law.  To accomplish these
purposes, the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     court means any court or
administrative agency of the State, or a subdivision thereof, whether or not a
court or administrative agency of record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     insurer means a corporation,
partnership, or other form of association which secures or provides insurance
under a policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     legal representative of a
servicemember means an attorney acting on the behalf of a servicemember or an
individual possessing power of attorney.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     military service means duty
by any person in the active military service of the United States or active
duty in the military service of the State pursuant to an order of the Governor
issued pursuant to law.  The term also means service by a United
 States citizen in the forces of a nation with which the United
  States is allied in the prosecution of a war or military action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     person means individuals,
partnerships, corporations, and any other forms of business association when
used herein with reference to the holder of any right alleged to exist against
a servicemember, or against a person secondarily liable under such right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     servicemember means a person
in military service.  Whenever the term servicemember is used, it shall be
treated as including a reference to a legal representative of a servicemember.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  When the enforcement
of an obligation or liability, the prosecution of a suit or proceeding, the
entry or enforcement of an order, writ, judgment, or decree, or the performance
of an act may be stayed, postponed, or suspended pursuant to a provision of
this act, such stay, postponement, or suspension may likewise be granted to a
surety, guarantor, endorser, and other subject to the obligation, liability,
performance, or enforcement, at the discretion of the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    When a judgment or
decree is vacated or set aside, in whole or in part, as provided in this act,
the judgment or decree may likewise be set aside and vacated as to a surety,
guarantor, endorser, accommodation maker, or other person whether primarily or
secondarily liable upon the obligation or enforcement, at the discretion of the
court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Nothing contained in
this act shall prevent a waiver in writing of the benefits afforded by
subsections a. and b. of this section by a surety, guarantor, endorser,
accommodation maker, or other person whether primarily or secondarily liable
upon the obligation or liability.  A waiver shall not be valid unless it is
executed as an instrument separate from the obligation or liability to which it
applies.  A waiver shall not be valid after the beginning of the period of
active duty if executed by a servicemember who is called to active duty
subsequent to the execution of such waiver.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    The rights and
protections of this act shall extend to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A member of a reserve
component who is ordered to report for military service during the period
beginning on the date of the members receipt of the order and ending either on
the date on which the member reports for military service or the date on which
the order is revoked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person who has been
ordered to report for induction under the Military Selective Service Act, 50
U.S.C. App. s.451 et seq., during the period beginning on the date of receipt
of the order for induction and ending either on the date on which the person
reports for induction or the date on which the order is revoked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A dependent of a
servicemember who, upon application to a court, demonstrates that the
dependents ability to comply with a lease, contract, bailment, or other
obligation is materially affected by reason of the servicemembers military
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Application by a
servicemember for, or receipt by such a person of, a stay, postponement, or
suspension pursuant to this act in the payment of a tax, fine, penalty,
insurance premium, or other civil obligation or liability shall not provide the
sole basis for any of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a determination by a lender or
other person that the servicemember is unable to pay the civil obligation or
liability in accordance with its terms;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a denial or revocation of

before the entry of a judgment or final order.  If the plaintiff is unable to
file such an affidavit, the plaintiff may file an affidavit to show either that
the defendant is on active duty or that the plaintiff is not able to determine

servicemember to defend the action if it appears that the servicemember was
materially affected by reason of that military service in making a defense of
the action and has a meritorious or legal defense to the action or some part of
the action.  Application to reopen the order may be made by a servicemember not
later than 90 days after the termination of active duty.</p>

obligation payable under its terms in installments under a contract for the
purchase of real estate, or secured by a mortgage or other instrument in the
nature of a mortgage upon real estate, a court may stay the enforcement of such
obligation during the applicant's period of active duty and, from the date of
termination of such period of active duty or from the date of application if
made after active duty, for a period equal to the period of the remaining life
of the installment contract or other instrument plus a period of time equal to
the period of active duty of the applicant, or any part of such combined
period.  The stay shall be subject to payment of the balance of principal and
accumulated interest due and unpaid at the date of termination of the period of
active duty or from the date of application in equal installments during such
combined period at such rate of interest on the unpaid balance as is prescribed
in such contract, or other instrument evidencing the obligation, for
installments paid when due.  The court may impose such other terms as may be
just.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In the case of another
obligation, liability, tax, or assessment, a court may stay the enforcement
thereof during the applicant's period of active duty and from the date of
termination of the period of active duty or from the date of application if
made after active duty, for a period of time equal to the period of active duty
of the applicant or any part of such period.  The stay shall be subject to
payment of the balance of principal and accumulated interest due and unpaid at
the date of the termination of such period of active duty or the date of
application in equal periodic installments during such extended period at such
rate of interest as may be prescribed for such obligation, liability, tax, or
assessment, if paid when due. The court may impose such other terms as may be
just.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    When any court has
granted a stay as provided in this section, a fine or penalty shall not accrue
during the period the terms and conditions of such stay are complied with by
reason of failure to comply with the terms or conditions of the obligation,
liability, tax or, assessment with respect to which such stay was granted.</p>

in a missing status, provided that the power of attorney: was duly executed by
the servicemember while in military service or before entry into military
service but after the servicemember received a call or order to report for
military service or notice that such call or order may occur; and designates
the servicemembers spouse, parent, or other named relative as the
servicemembers attorney in fact.  This section shall not apply to a document

professional liability insurance policy of a servicemember who was engaged in
furnishing professional services immediately before receiving an order to
active duty shall be suspended by the insurer upon receipt of a written request
from the servicemember.  The insurer shall not require that premiums be paid on
behalf of such a servicemember during the period that coverage is suspended and
shall refund any amount paid for coverage of the period of such suspension
unless the servicemember elects to apply such amount to any premium due upon
the reinstatement of coverage.  The insurer shall not be liable for a claim
that is based on professional conduct of a servicemember that occurs during the
period of suspension, except that the failure of a servicemember to make
adequate provision for a patient, client, or other person to receive
professional services or assistance during the period of the servicemembers
military service shall be considered to arise prior to the period of
suspension.</p>

professional liability insurance policy that has been suspended pursuant to
subsection a. of this section shall be reinstated by the insurer on the date on
which that servicemember transmits a written request for reinstatement to the
insurer, provided that the written request is transmitted to the insurer within
30 days after the date on which the servicemember is released from active
duty.  Such reinstatement shall be for a period of at least the balance of the
period for which coverage would have continued under the insurance policy if
coverage had not been suspended.  The insurer shall not increase the amount of
the premium during such required period except to the extent that the insurer
has increased premiums with general applicability.</p>

liable for a claim for damages for professional negligence or other
professional liability during the period of suspension, to the same extent the
insurer would be liable during a period of coverage, in the case where a
servicemember dies during the period of suspension.</p>

120 days after the date of termination of or release from military service, a
servicemember shall be entitled to reinstatement of health insurance that was
in effect on the day before entrance into military service and was terminated
during the period of such service.  Such reinstatement shall not be subject to
an exclusion or waiting period if the condition arose before or during the
period of military service, an exclusion or waiting period would not have been
imposed for the condition during the period of coverage, and the condition has
not been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be a disability
incurred or aggravated in the line of duty.  The insurer shall not increase the
amount of the premium during the balance of the period for which coverage would
have been continued had the coverage not been terminated except to the extent
that the insurer has increased premiums with general applicability.</p>

person for loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of the employer's
unlawful action.  The court shall order an expedited hearing in such a case.  A
person claiming to be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of this section
may appear and be represented by counsel.  A person may request in writing that
the Attorney General of the State appear and act on the person's behalf.  If
the Attorney General is reasonably satisfied that the person so applying is
entitled to such benefits, the Attorney General shall appear and act as
attorney for such person in the amicable adjustment of the claim, or in the
filing of a complaint and the prosecution thereof.  In the hearing and
