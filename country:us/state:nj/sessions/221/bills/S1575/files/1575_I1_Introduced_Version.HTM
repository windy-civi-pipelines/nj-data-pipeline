<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Medically underserved area
means an area designated by the federal Health Resources and Services
Administration as having too few primary care providers, a high rate of infant
mortality and poverty, and a disproportionately high share of elderly persons
in the population of the area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     MOM Project or program
means the MOM Project program established pursuant to section 3 of this act.</p>

and declares:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Maternal periodontal
disease is linked to preterm birth and low birthweight. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Pregnant women with
chronic periodontal disease are seven times more likely to go into labor
prematurely.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Treatment of
periodontal disease during pregnancy has been shown to be safe and effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention reports that 47 percent of American adults 30
years of age or older have periodontal disease, and between 60 percent and 75
percent of pregnant women have gingivitis, which can occur due to hormonal changes
during pregnancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     According to the

significant, but preventable public health problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     High levels of
cariogenic bacteria in pregnant women can increase the risk of dental cavities
in infants or young children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Pregnant women and
caregivers can implement preventive measures to decrease a childs risk of
developing dental disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    According to an article
published in the New England Journal of Medicine: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the cost of dental care in
the U.S. has increased 30 percent in the past 20 years; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) in 2018, Americans paid
$55 billion in out-of-pocket dental expenses, which was more than 25 percent of
all health care out-of-pocket spending; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) dental and oral disease is
particularly burdensome to marginalized and chronically underserved
populations; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) groups that have been most
affected by COVID-19 in the U.S. appear to be those groups with
disproportionately high rates of oral disease; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Pregnant women and
women who have recently given birth in medically underserved areas and people
who earn a low-income tend to lack access to dental care due to: </p>

for dental care services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the absence or shortage of

status, discrimination, or bias related to racial or socio-economic status;</p>

interest for the Legislature: </p>

test and design a sustainable model for access to oral health education and
dental care for certain at-risk women who are pregnant or who recently have
given birth; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) to collect data regarding
the effect of dental health care and education on health. </p>

registration and in a manner that is consistent with federal and State privacy
laws, the consortium shall endeavor to collect the following information from
eligible mothers: whether the mother has or had access to a dental home during
a current or prior pregnancy; the mothers oral hygiene routine, including the
use of fluoride toothpaste; the mothers dietary habits; and the results of
previous pregnancies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Each consortium shall
establish an oral health education program.  Prior to the commencement of the
oral health education program, each consortium shall require eligible mothers
to complete a pre-education assessment that includes testing the mothers understanding
of oral health and oral hygiene.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Each consortium shall
provide eligible mothers a minimum of three hours of oral health education that
includes the following:  oral hygiene routines for mothers, infants, and
children; nutritional counseling; education regarding the correlation between cariogenic
disease and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and gastric changes; the impact
of tobacco, drugs, and alcohol on a mothers oral health and the unborn child;
recommendations and resources for routine oral health care for mothers,
infants, and children; and education regarding available educational support. 
Oral health education program educators shall be compatible with the language
and cultural needs of the eligible mothers enrolled in the oral health
education program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Following the eligible
mothers completion of the oral health education program, the consortium shall
require the eligible mother to complete a post-education assessment that
includes testing to assess the mothers understanding of oral health and oral hygiene
routines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within 90 days following
the effective date of this act, a community oral health center seeking to

in a manner to be determined by the department.  The department shall require
an eligible community oral health center to enter into an agreement with a
consortium to implement the following: </p>

develop a customized oral health treatment plan and nutritional recommendations
for the mother, infant, and child, as applicable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Following an eligible
mothers completion of the oral health education program, provide the mother,
infant, and child, as applicable, oral health treatment for one year.  The
dental care shall include the following:</p>

initial dental visit;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   two dental visits for
the child or infant; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   identification of a

following the effective date of this act, each consortium and health center
shall compile and report relevant data to the department, as determined by the
department. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1) Within 180 days
following the effective date of this act, the department shall contract with a
third-party to assist with data analysis and project evaluation activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Prior to the expiration of
this act, the department and the third-party hired to assist with data analysis
and project evaluation activities shall informally convene an advisory panel of
interested stakeholders, including, but not limited to, the consortia and
centers participating in the MOM Project, Medicaid managed care organizations,
and the Department of Human Services to evaluate reported data.  This
evaluation shall consider, at a minimum, the costs of the MOM Project and
comparison costs if similar services were purchased through the Medicaid
program on a fee for service basis, the results of the oral health education
program based on test results, and maternal and child health outcomes as
compared to a similar group of Medicaid beneficiaries who did not participate
in the MOM Project. Based on its findings, the advisory panel shall design a
model to be potentially included in the Medicaid program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The department shall
prepare and submit a report of its findings to the Governor, and to the
Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1).</p>
