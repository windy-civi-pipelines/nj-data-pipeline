<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  a.  As used
in this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Disabled veterans property
tax exemption means the exemption authorized pursuant to P.L.1948, c.259
(C.54:4-3.30 et seq.) or section 2 of P.L.2021, c.75 (C.54:4-3.30a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified veteran means a
veteran who has been declared by the United States Department of Veterans'
Affairs, or its successor, to have a 100 percent service-connected disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Surviving spouse means the
surviving spouse of a qualified veteran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  A qualified veteran or
surviving spouse who seeks a mortgage loan from a State-chartered bank,
mortgage company, or credit union for a dwelling house that is to be occupied
as the persons principal residence shall not be required by that bank,
mortgage company, or credit union, as part of the underwriting requirements for
that mortgage, to indicate or disclose the annual property tax obligation on
that dwelling house, provided that the assessor of the municipality in which
the property is located certifies to the State-chartered bank, mortgage
company, or credit union on a form promulgated for this purpose by the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance that the qualified veteran or surviving
spouse currently satisfies all eligibility requirements for the disabled
veterans property tax exemption, other than ownership of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A qualified veteran or
surviving spouse who seeks a mortgage to refinance an existing mortgage on a
dwelling house that is the persons current principal residence shall not be
required by that bank, mortgage company, or credit union as part of the
underwriting requirements for that mortgage, to indicate or disclose the annual
property tax obligations on that dwelling house, provided that the assessor of
the municipality in which the dwelling house is located certifies to the
State-chartered bank, mortgage company, or credit union on a form promulgated
for this purpose by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance that the qualified
veteran or surviving spouse currently satisfies all eligibility requirements
for the disabled veterans property tax exemption, including ownership of the
property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  If, on the date that the qualified
veteran or surviving spouse applies for a mortgage on a dwelling house, the qualified
veteran or surviving spouse owns and occupies another dwelling house in the
State as their principal residence, the mortgage shall not be approved until
the qualified veteran or surviving spouse has:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) provided evidence to the
State-chartered bank, mortgage company or credit union that the current
dwelling house has been sold or transferred or is under contract for sale or
transfer; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) notified the assessor of
the municipality in which the current dwelling house is located that the qualified
veteran or surviving spouse will no longer be occupying the dwelling house as
their legal residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 2 of P.L.1948,
c.259 (C.54:4-3.31) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  <u>a.</u>  All exemptions
from taxation under P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30 et seq.) shall be allowed by
the assessor upon the filing with him of a claim in writing under oath, made by
or on behalf of the person claiming the same, showing the right to the
exemption, briefly describing the property for which exemption is claimed and
having annexed thereto a certificate of the claimant's honorable discharge or
release under honorable circumstances, from active service in any branch of the
Armed Forces of the United States and a certificate from the United States
Department of Veterans' Affairs or its successor, certifying to a
service-connected disability of such claimant of the character described in
section 1 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30).  In the case of a claim by a
surviving spouse of such veteran, the claimant shall establish in writing under
oath that the claimant is the owner of the legal title to the premises on which
exemption is claimed; that the claimant occupies the dwelling house on said
premises as the claimant's legal residence in this State; that the veteran
shall have been declared, either during the veteran's lifetime or after the
veteran's death, by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs to have
or to have had a service-connected disability of a character described in this
act, or, in the case of a claim for an exemption under subsection c. of section
1 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30), that the veteran shall have been declared
to have died in active service; that the veteran was entitled to an exemption
provided for in this act, except for an exemption under paragraph (2) of
subsection b. and subsection c. of section 1 hereof, at the time of death; and
that the claimant is a resident of this State and has not remarried.  Such
exemptions shall be allowed and prorated by the assessor for the remainder of
any taxable year from the date the claimant shall have acquired title to the
real property intended to be exempt by this act.  Where a portion of a
multiple-family building or structure occupied by the claimant is the subject
of such exemption, the assessor shall aggregate the assessment on the lot or
curtilage and building or structure and allow an exemption of that percentage
of the aggregate assessment as the value of the portion of the building or
structure occupied by the claimant bears to the value of the entire building or
structure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.  (1)  A veteran or
surviving spouse who has applied for a mortgage pursuant to the provisions of

information for each State-chartered bank, mortgage company, or credit union from
which the veteran or surviving spouse seeks a mortgage, as well as all of the
documentation required in subsection a. of this section.</u></p>

application for a mortgage related to a dwelling house in which the veteran or
surviving spouse does not currently reside, the assessor shall certify whether

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits certain
financial institutions from requiring certain disabled veterans to include
anticipated property tax obligations as part of a mortgage applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a veteran
who has been declared by the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs to
have a 100 percent service-connected disability, and meets all of the
requirements for a veterans property tax exemption, may apply to the
municipality in which their principal residence is located for a property tax
exemption.  The surviving spouse of such a veteran is also entitled to the
property tax exemption for the duration of their widowhood or widowerhood,
provided that certain eligibility criteria are met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, when a person,
including a disabled veteran or their surviving spouse, seeks a mortgage to
purchase a home, banks, mortgage companies, and credit unions generally require
that the person qualify for the mortgage based on the calculated monthly
mortgage payment for the mortgage loan, plus the monthly share of the annual
property tax bill.  Although these persons may qualify for a total property tax
exemption after purchasing the property, the inclusion of property tax
obligations in the mortgage application can make it significantly more
difficult for these persons to obtain a mortgage, as well as increase the
interest rates that may be approved for these mortgage applicants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, when a
qualified veteran who has been declared by the United States Department of
Veterans' Affairs to have a 100 percent service-connected disability, or their
surviving spouse, seeks a mortgage loan from a State-chartered bank, mortgage
company, or credit union for a dwelling house that is to be the persons
principal residence, the bank, mortgage company, or credit union may not
require the person to indicate or disclose the annual property tax obligation
on that dwelling house as part of the underwriting requirements for the
mortgage loan, provided that the assessor of the municipality in which the
property is located determines that the veteran or surviving spouse satisfies
all of the eligibility requirements for the disabled veterans property tax exemption,
other than the ownership of the property, and certifies the same to the
State-chartered bank, mortgage company, or credit union on a form promulgated
for this purpose by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.  In the case of
a mortgage refinance application, the qualified veteran or surviving spouse
would be required to meet all of the eligibility requirements for the disabled
veterans property tax exemption, including ownership of the property.</p>
