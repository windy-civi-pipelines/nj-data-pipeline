<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires public
water systems to provide certain notifications about elevated perfluoroalkyl
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) levels in drinking water to customers and
local officials, require landlords to notify tenants of elevated PFAS levels in
drinking water, and require the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP),
in conjunction with the Department of Health (DOH), to establish an educational
program concerning the presence of PFAS in drinking water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Beginning 18 months after the
bill's enactment, a public water system whose drinking water exceeds a PFAS
maximum contaminant level (MCL) would be required to provide a written notice,
via regular or electronic mail, or both, to all customers served by the public
water system, including all residences, schools, daycare centers, and
facilities serving young children, all public and private hospitals, medical
clinics, and doctors offices serving pregnant women and young children, all
local health and welfare agencies in the public water system's service area,
and the chief executive of each municipality in the public water system's
service area.  The written notice would be required to be sent as soon as
practicable, but no later than 30 calendar days after the public water system
confirms that there has been an exceedance of a PFAS MCL.  This notification
requirement would be in addition to existing notification requirements under
the federal &quot;Safe Drinking Water Act,&quot; 42 U.S.C. s.300 et al., or any
other State or federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill, PFAS
means any member of the class of fluorinated organic chemicals containing at
least one fully fluorinated carbon atom and PFAS maximum contaminant level
means the applicable maximum contaminant level for PFAS, or a category or type
of PFAS, in drinking water established by the DEP pursuant to the &quot;Safe
Drinking Water Act,&quot; P.L.1977, c.224 (C.58:12A-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The written notice to be sent
by a public water system would be required to:  (1) clearly state that the
public water system is in exceedance of a PFAS MCL; (2) explain what the PFAS
MCL is and the measurement process that the public water system is required to
perform to monitor drinking water for PFAS; (3) state that drinking water that
contains elevated levels of a PFAS can cause negative health effects; (4)
provide information to direct the consumer to the educational program developed
by the DEP pursuant to section 4 of the bill, including a link to the DEPs
Internet website where the educational resources are located; and (5) state, in
easily legible type, the responsibility of a landlord to distribute the written
notice to every tenant pursuant to section 3 the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
public water systems to provide annual written notifications to all customers
served by the public water system where an exceedance of a PFAS MCL has been
found., until there is no longer an exceedance of the PFAS MCL.  The annual written
notifications would be required to include, at a minimum:  (1) an update on the
current status of the mitigation process along with an estimate of the time
until the mitigation process will be completed; and (2) any information on what
work, if any, has been done to mitigate the contamination or treat the
contaminated drinking water supply.  The bill would also require public water
systems to provide a written notification informing customers when a PFAS
exceedance has ended.  A public water system that violates any of the
notification requirements of the bill would be considered to be in violation of
the &quot;Safe Drinking Water Act,&quot; which could result in civil
administrative penalties of up to $25,000. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Beginning 18 months after the
bill's enactment, the bill would require landlords, whenever they receive a
notice or health and safety information from a public water system concerning
the presence of PFAS in drinking water, to:  (1) distribute the notice or
information, by any means including by electronic mail, as soon as practicable,
but no later than three business days after receipt, to every tenant who has
entered into a lease agreement with the landlord and whose dwelling unit is
served by the public water system; and (2) post the notice or information, as
soon as practicable, but no later than three business days after receipt, in a
prominent location at the entrance of each rental premises that is owned by the
landlord and served by the public water system, except in single-family
dwellings that do not have a common area.  The bill would also require
landlords to provide the most recent information about a PFAS exceedance they
have received to any prospective tenant prior to signing a lease.  A landlord
who violates any of the notification requirements of the bill would first
receive a written warning from the DEP, and, for subsequent violations, could
face a civil administrative penalty of up to $500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
require the DEP and the DOH, no later than one year after the bills enactment,
to establish and implement an educational program concerning PFAS in drinking
water.  The program would be required to:  (1) educate the general public on
the subject of PFAS and its environmental and health impacts; (2) provide
informational resources specific to PFAS in drinking water; and (3) provide any
other information and efforts that are determined by the DEP or the DOH to be
beneficial in educating the public on the presence of PFAS in drinking water. 
The DEP would be required to publish the educational program to its Internet
website and update it annually.</p>
