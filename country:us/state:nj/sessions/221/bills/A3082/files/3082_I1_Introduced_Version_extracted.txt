Under the bill, receiving a license and having it solemnized via audio-visual technology requires: the video conference be live and allow for interaction between the couple, the licensing official or officiant, and witnesses; members of the couple and witnesses provide valid photo identification and any other documents necessary to allow the licensing official or officiant to fulfill their statutory duty; and each member of the couple and the witnesses sign the pertinent documents and transmit the documents, once signed by all signatories, to the licensing official or officiant.
