S2117 SENATE, No. 2117 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  HOLLY T. SCHEPISI District 39 (Bergen) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Holzapfel SYNOPSIS Directs State Board of Education to rescind New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education and directs boards of education to establish Parental Advisory Committees and adopt standards for health instruction. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, supplementing chapter 35 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)   a. The State Board of Education shall rescind the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education adopted by the board on June 3, 2020.  The board shall be prohibited from adopting any future Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education or from mandating any similar curriculum requirements or standards in the subjects of health and physical education. b.    Each local board of education shall establish a Parental Advisory Committee to work with the board and school district personnel in the development of curriculum standards for the instruction of students in the subjects of health and physical education. Members of the committee shall be reflective of the parents and guardians of students enrolled in the district. Any meeting of the committee shall be open to members of the public.   The recommendations of the committee shall be posted on the school districts website for public inspection. c. Within 180 days of the enactment of P.L.   , c.    (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), each local board of education shall adopt curriculum standards for the instruction of students in the subjects of health and physical education. 2.    Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.310 (C.18A:6-111) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Suicide is a leading cause of death for young people in this State.  According to the Center for Health Statistics in the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, between 1999 and 2001 more than 1,500 young people ages 13 to 18 made suicide attempts which resulted in hospitalization.  More than 50 of these attempts were fatal.  When young people up to 24 years of age are added to the equation, the number of attempted suicides rises to 3,000 and the number of fatalities rises to nearly 200. b.    A suicide can devastate a community.  According to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), suicide severely impacts the families and friends left behind, who often wrongly live with extreme shame and guilt over not having prevented the death of their loved one.  Moreover, many attempts which do not result in death nonetheless end in serious injury to the victims and lifelong trauma to their families and those who know them. c.     A person who is considering suicide may exhibit behavioral warning signs.  If someone notices the warning signs of suicide, it may be possible to avert a tragedy.  With the possible exception of a parent, no one is better situated than a teacher to detect these signs and to initiate appropriate steps to prevent a suicide attempt.  Proper training for teaching staff members can thus save pupils' lives and save the families and friends of would-be victims the trauma of a suicide or suicide attempt.  Moreover, early identification of depression and other problems may help to reduce the number of young people who commit or attempt to commit suicide once they have left school and entered adulthood. d.    It is therefore appropriate for the Legislature to require [:] the State Board of Education to require instruction in suicide prevention as part of any continuing education which public school teaching staff members must complete to maintain their certification [; and inclusion of suicide prevention awareness in the Core Curriculum Content Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education]. (cf: P.L.2005, c.310, s.1) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2005, c.310 (C.18A:6-113) is amended to read as follows: 3.    [Within 180 days of the effective date of this act, the State Board of Education] Each local board of education shall [revise the Core Curriculum Content Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education to] , as part of its implementation of curriculum standards in health and physical education adopted pursuant to section 1 of P.L.   , c.    (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provide for instruction in suicide prevention in an appropriate place in the curriculum of elementary school, middle school, and high school pupils.

The bill amends numerous sections of law that pertain to the development of, or requirements within, the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education.  The bill maintains these instruction requirements, but provides that the instruction will be given as part of a local school districts implementation of the curriculum standards in health and physical education adopted by the local board pursuant to the bills provisions.  These sections of law require public school instruction on the topics of: suicide prevention; organ donation; sexual abuse and assault; dating violence; gang violence; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; sexting; consent for physical contact and sexual activity; mental health; the New Jersey Safe Haven Infant Protection Act; breast self-examination; and substance abuse.  The bill removes any provisions within these sections of law that require the Department of Education to provide sample learning activities, resources, or materials to local school districts on these topics.

STATEMENT This bill directs the State Board of Education to rescind the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education, which were most recently adopted by the board on June 3, 2020.  Under the bill, the board will be prohibited from adopting any future Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education or from mandating any similar curriculum requirements or standards in the subjects of health and physical education.  The bill directs each local board of education to establish a Parental Advisory Committee to work with the board and school district personnel in the development of curriculum standards for the instruction of students in the subjects of health and physical education.  Under the bill, committee membership is required to be reflective of the parents and guardians of students enrolled in the district. The bill requires any meeting of the committee to be open to members of the public and requires that the committees recommendations are posted on the school districts website for public inspection.  The bill directs local boards of education to, within 180 days of the bills enactment, adopt curriculum standards for the instruction of students in the subjects of health and physical education. The bill amends numerous sections of law that pertain to the development of, or requirements within, the New Jersey Student Learning Standards in Comprehensive Health and Physical Education.  The bill maintains these instruction requirements, but provides that the instruction will be given as part of a local school districts implementation of the curriculum standards in health and physical education adopted by the local board pursuant to the bills provisions.  These sections of law require public school instruction on the topics of: suicide prevention; organ donation; sexual abuse and assault; dating violence; gang violence; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; sexting; consent for physical contact and sexual activity; mental health; the New Jersey Safe Haven Infant Protection Act; breast self-examination; and substance abuse.  The bill removes any provisions within these sections of law that require the Department of Education to provide sample learning activities, resources, or materials to local school districts on these topics.
