eliminated the termination of Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS)

the compensation upon which contributions by the member were based in the last year
of creditable service, to continue during her or his widowhood.  If there is no
survivor or in the case of death or remarriage, there is also paid 20 percent
of final compensation to one surviving child or 35 percent of final
compensation to two surviving children or 50 percent such compensation in equal
shares.</p>

compensation to one surviving child or an additional 25 percent of such

widower or in case the widow or widower dies or remarries, the payments equal
