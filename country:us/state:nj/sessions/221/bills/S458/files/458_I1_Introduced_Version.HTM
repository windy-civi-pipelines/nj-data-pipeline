(cf: P.L.1999, c.428, s.7) 5.    (New section)   Any person who was married to or had a domestic partnership with a member who died and who subsequently became ineligible to receive the death benefit payable pursuant to section 26 of P.L.1967, c.250 (C.43:16A-12.1) because of remarriage prior to the effective date of this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be reclassified as a widow or widower as of the effective date of this act and eligible for the pension from the effective date forward. 6.    (New section)    The State shall reimburse employers other than the State for additional costs arising from any increase in the pension benefits payable to a widow, widower or domestic partner pursuant to this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill). 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT A law enacted in 2003 eliminated the termination of Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS) accidental death benefits received by a surviving spouse or domestic partner upon remarriage or the establishment of a new domestic partnership.  This bill would ensure that all surviving PFRS spouses or partners are treated the same by providing that the eligibility of any survivors pension will not terminate under these circumstances.  The bill also restores the survivors pension to those who lost this benefit because of remarriage prior to the enactment of this bill. Under the PFRS, when a member of the system dies in active service, the widow or widower is eligible to receive a survivorship benefit consisting of a pension equal to 50 percent of the compensation upon which contributions by the member were based in the last year of creditable service, to continue during her or his widowhood.  If there is no survivor or in the case of death or remarriage, there is also paid 20 percent of final compensation to one surviving child or 35 percent of final compensation to two surviving children or 50 percent such compensation in equal shares. In the event of death after retirement, the surviving spouse is eligible to receive a survivorship pension consisting of a pension equal to 50 percent of final compensation, to continue during her or his widowhood, and there will also be paid 15 percent of such compensation to one surviving child or an additional 25 percent of such compensation to two or more children.  If there is no surviving widow or widower or in case the widow or widower dies or remarries, the payments equal 20 percent of final compensation payable to one surviving child, 35 percent of such compensation to two surviving children in equal shares and if there are three or more children, 50 percent of such compensation in equal shares. Currently, the surviving spouse or partner ceases to be eligible for these survivors pensions upon remarriage or the establishment of another domestic partnership.  This bill would ensure that these survivors benefits do not terminate.

STATEMENT A law enacted in 2003 eliminated the termination of Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS) accidental death benefits received by a surviving spouse or domestic partner upon remarriage or the establishment of a new domestic partnership.  This bill would ensure that all surviving PFRS spouses or partners are treated the same by providing that the eligibility of any survivors pension will not terminate under these circumstances.  The bill also restores the survivors pension to those who lost this benefit because of remarriage prior to the enactment of this bill. Under the PFRS, when a member of the system dies in active service, the widow or widower is eligible to receive a survivorship benefit consisting of a pension equal to 50 percent of the compensation upon which contributions by the member were based in the last year of creditable service, to continue during her or his widowhood.  If there is no survivor or in the case of death or remarriage, there is also paid 20 percent of final compensation to one surviving child or 35 percent of final compensation to two surviving children or 50 percent such compensation in equal shares. In the event of death after retirement, the surviving spouse is eligible to receive a survivorship pension consisting of a pension equal to 50 percent of final compensation, to continue during her or his widowhood, and there will also be paid 15 percent of such compensation to one surviving child or an additional 25 percent of such compensation to two or more children.  If there is no surviving widow or widower or in case the widow or widower dies or remarries, the payments equal 20 percent of final compensation payable to one surviving child, 35 percent of such compensation to two surviving children in equal shares and if there are three or more children, 50 percent of such compensation in equal shares. Currently, the surviving spouse or partner ceases to be eligible for these survivors pensions upon remarriage or the establishment of another domestic partnership.  This bill would ensure that these survivors benefits do not terminate.
