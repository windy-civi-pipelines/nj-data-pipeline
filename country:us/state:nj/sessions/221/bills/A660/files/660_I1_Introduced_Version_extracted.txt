The bill defines low-speed electric bicycle to mean a two or three-wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals, an electric motor of less than 750 watts, and that meets the requirements of a class 1 low-speed electric bicycle (i.e., a low-speed electric bicycle equipped with a motor that provides assistance only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour) or a class 2 low-speed electric bicycle (i.e., a low-speed electric bicycle equipped with a motor that may be used exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing assistance when the bicycle reaches the speed of 20 miles per hour).
