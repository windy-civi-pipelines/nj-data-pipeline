<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  A county
or municipal police department may request an open competitive examination to
fill a vacancy for an entrance level law enforcement title.  The examination
shall be held no later than ten business days from the date of receipt of the
request for the examination by the commission, and shall be held in an
appropriate location agreed to by the commission and the appointing authority. 
The names of the persons who receive a passing score shall be consolidated with
the most recent eligible list for such title.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  The
appointing authority for a county police department and force may classify all
the duly qualified applicants for members of the department into the following
classes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     I.     Residents of the
county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     II.   Other residents of the
State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     III.  All other qualified
applicants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within each classification,
duly qualified applicants who are veterans shall be accorded all veterans'
preferences as are provided by law.  Any person who has served in the armed
services of the United States and been discharged or released from the service
under conditions other than dishonorable within six months prior to making
application for appointment as a member of the county police department and
force and who, at the time of making the application, signs a notice of intention
and agreement to become a resident of the State within six months from the date
of appointment, shall be placed in Class II.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Preference in appointment
second to that accorded to veterans as provided by law, but superseding that
accorded non-veterans, shall be accorded all duly qualified applicants whose
natural or adoptive parent was killed in the lawful discharge of official
duties while serving as a law enforcement officer in any law enforcement agency
in the State at any time prior to the closing date for the filing of an
application, provided that required documentation is submitted with the
application by the closing date, except that this preference shall not apply if
the county has entered into a consent decree with the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>United States Department of Justice
concerning the hiring practices of the county.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When a veteran and a
non-veteran whose parent was killed in the lawful discharge of official duties
while serving as a law enforcement officer in any law enforcement agency in the
State are duly qualified applicants for a position, first preference shall be
given to the veteran.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section,
&quot;law enforcement officer&quot; means any person who is employed as a
permanent full-time member of a law enforcement agency, and who is statutorily
empowered to act for the detection, investigation, arrest, and conviction of
persons violating the criminal laws of this State and statutorily required to
successfully complete a training course approved, or certified as being
substantially equivalent to the approved course, by the Police Training
Commission pursuant to P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-66 et seq.); and &quot;law
enforcement agency&quot; means a department, division, bureau, commission,
board, or other authority of the State or of any political subdivision thereof
which has by statute or ordinance the responsibility of detecting and enforcing
the general criminal laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In any county which
classifies qualified applicants pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the
appointing authority shall first appoint all those in Class I and then those in
each succeeding class in the order above listed, and shall appoint a person or
persons in a class only to a vacancy or vacancies remaining after all qualified
applicants in the preceding class or classes have been appointed or have
declined an offer of appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In any county operating
under the provisions of Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes which classifies
qualified applicants pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the classes of
qualified applicants defined in that subsection shall be considered as separate
and successive lists of eligibles, and the Civil Service Commission shall, when
requested to certify eligibles for positions specified in this section, make
the certifications from those classes separately and successively, and shall
certify no persons from a class until all persons in the preceding class or
classes have been appointed or have declined offers of appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    This section shall apply
only to initial appointments and not to promotional appointments of persons
already members of the county police department and force.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In making temporary
appointments, the appointing authority may utilize the classifications set
forth in subsection a. of this section, and shall classify accordingly all duly
qualified applicants for the positions to be temporarily filled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    N.J.S.11A:4-5 is amended
to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11A:4-5.     Use of eligible
list.  <u>a.</u>  Once the examination process has been initiated due to the appointment
of a provisional or an appointing authority's request for a list to fill a
vacancy, the affected appointing authority shall be required to make
appointments from the list if there is a complete certification, unless

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law does not address
when an entry level law enforcement examination will be held, but the Civil
Service Commission has maintained a practice of administering such examinations
once every three years. This bill permits a county or municipal police
department to request an entrance level law enforcement examination in order to
fill a vacancy.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The examination will be held
no later than ten business days from receipt of the request for the
examination.  In addition, the names of persons who receive a passing score
will be consolidated with the most recent eligible list for such title.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would allow a county
to establish a hiring preference for county residents for county police officer
positions.  Current law allows municipal police departments to have a hiring
preference for municipal residents, but does not authorize the same with
respect to county police departments.  This bill would enable county police
departments to prioritize county residents when hiring new officers, which
would allow county police forces to be more reflective of the communities they
serve.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As is provided with respect to
municipal police departments, this bill maintains veterans' preferences that
are provided by law and provides a secondary preference for the children of law
enforcement officers killed in the line of duty.  These preferences would apply
within each residence classification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, if an
appointing authority makes an appointment from an entry-level law enforcement
eligible list certified by the Civil Service Commission, the commission will
remove the name of the person appointed from the eligible list for all
entry-level law enforcement positions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, once an
individual is hired to an entry-level law enforcement positon, the individuals
name is not removed from any eligible list for other law enforcement positions. 
Although now employed and trained by a department, the individuals name
remains on the eligible list for other departments.  This bill will prevent an
individual from accepting a position with the first available department,
receiving training at the expense of that department, and then accepting a
position with another department that individual deems more favorable for
geographic or financial reasons.  The bill will help prevent a department from
losing the benefit of a trained individual and the added expense of training
another individual.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would expand the
training reimbursement amount and time period that applies to certain law
enforcement agencies that hire new law enforcement officers.  This bill would
help further discourage the practice of hiring away new law enforcement
officers from other agencies that have invested the time and resources into recruiting
and training them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, whenever a
county or municipal law enforcement officer is hired by a different county or
municipal law enforcement agency, an educational institutions police
department, a State law enforcement agency, or the New Jersey Transit Police
Department within 30 days of holding a permanent appointment, the hiring agency
is required to reimburse the former employer 100 percent of the examination,
hiring, and training costs it bore.  If one of those agencies hires a county or
municipal law enforcement officer within two years, but more than 30 days, of
holding a permanent appointment, the appointing agency is required to reimburse
the former employer 50 percent of the examination, hiring, and training costs. 
These same reimbursement timeframes and amounts apply when a municipality hires
a Class Two special law enforcement officer from another municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For these law enforcement
hires, the bill would increase the time period during which a reimbursement is
required to two years, and would increase the amount of the reimbursement to
150 percent of the examination, hiring, and training costs.</p>
