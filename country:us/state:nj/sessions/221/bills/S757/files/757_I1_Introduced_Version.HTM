concerning probation employees, supplementing chapter 4 of Title 30 of the
Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1968, c.303 and P.L.2001, c.362.</p>

class=BillHeading2><span style='color:black'>Be It Enacted </span></span><span
class=BillLanguage><span style='color:black'>by the Senate and General Assembly
of the State of New Jersey:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     1.    (New
section)  The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     a.     The
enforcement of probation sentences is crucial to the public safety;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    Despite
a drop in the overall crime rate, the number of dangerous and repeat offenders
who are serving probation sentences has continued to rise in New Jersey;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     c.     The
number of probationers who have violated the conditions of probation and have a
warrant issued for their arrest has reached 15,000;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     d.    Probation
officers working in the New Jersey State courts are not currently permitted to
enforce these warrants;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     e.     Probation
officers in other states are permitted to act as law enforcement officers;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     f.     Probation
officers in other states have law enforcement powers and at least 200 of them
in New Jersey should in the interest of public safety, have these powers here
independent of their current employer, the Judiciary which has limited these
powers;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     g.    The
Legislatures efforts to address this issue in 2001 by establishing a
Probation Officer Community Safety Unit consisting of 200 officers empowered
to carry a firearm, enforce the criminal laws of the State, and arrest
probationers who violate the terms of their probation was held to be
unconstitutional by the New Jersey Supreme Court as a violation of the
separation of powers doctrine;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     h.    It
is, therefore, altogether fitting and proper, and within the public interest,
for the Legislature to accomplish these objectives by transferring all
probation officers, and those covered by current contracts involving probation
officers, from the Judiciary to the Bureau of Probation in the State Parole
Board, authorizing 200 of those probation officers to carry a firearm and
affording them law enforcement powers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     2.    (New
section)  a.  All of the functions, powers, and duties of the Judiciary
concerning probation, except as herein otherwise provided, are hereby
transferred to the Bureau of Probation in the State Parole Board and shall be
exercised by the Chairman of the State Parole Board.  Unless otherwise specified
in this act, this transfer shall be subject to the provisions of the
&quot;State Agency Transfer Act,&quot; P.L.1971, c.375 (C.52:14D-1 et seq.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    All
records, equipment, technology, and other personal property, appropriations,
and any unexpended balances of funds appropriated or otherwise available to the
Judiciary pertaining to probation officers and employees covered by the two
contracts as set forth in section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill) and appropriated for the continued
performance of these employees duties., shall be transferred to the Bureau of
Probation in the State Parole Board pursuant to the State Agency Transfer Act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     3.    (New
section)  a.  All probation officers appointed pursuant to N.J.S.2A:168-5,
including supervisory employees and case-related professional employees, and
all employees who are subject to Judiciary contracts for the professional
supervisors unit and case-related professionals unit, are hereby transferred
from the Judiciary to the Bureau of Probation in the State Parole Board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    The
affected contracts are as follows: Contract between PANJ and the New Jersey
State Judiciary covering the Case-Related Professional Unit, and Contract
between PANJ and PANJ Supervisors, covering the Professional Supervisors Unit
or Union.  The terms and provisions of these contracts shall remain in effect
until successor contracts are negotiated.  All employees who are represented
pursuant to these contracts shall be included in this transfer from the
Judiciary to the Bureau of Probation in the State Parole Board.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     4.    (New
section)  a.  Nothing in this act, including any provision concerning the
transfer or use of funds or property, shall be construed to alter or modify the
responsibilities and specifications for any probation officer, or the position
of employees covered by the two contracts, as those responsibilities,
specifications, and positions were prior to the effective date of this act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     b.    The
implementation of this act shall not be construed to alter or modify the
assignment of any probation officer or employees covered by the two contracts
prior to the effective date of this act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     c.     Nothing
in this act shall be construed to alter or modify the rights and privileges
granted to probation officers pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2001, c.362
(C.2B:10A-1 et seq.) and any judicial determinations concerning that act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     5.    (New
section)  Whenever any statute, rule, regulation, order, contract, tariff,
document, reorganization plan, or judicial or administrative proceeding
concerning probation officers refers to the Judiciary or the Administrative
Office of the Courts, the reference shall mean and refer to the Bureau of
Probation in the State Parole Board, unless otherwise stated in this act.</span></p>

probation officers who are authorized to carry a firearm and who have the
authority to arrest probationers, enforce the criminal laws of this State, and
enforce warrants for the apprehension and arrest of probationers who violate
conditions of probation. Initially established in 2001, the New Jersey Supreme
Court held that the Legislature violated the separation of powers doctrine when
it established the unit as probation officers are an integral part of the court
system and are under the regulatory control of the Judiciary. </p>
