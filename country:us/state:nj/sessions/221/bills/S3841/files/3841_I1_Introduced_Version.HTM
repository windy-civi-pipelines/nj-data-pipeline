(cf: P.L.2020, c.118, s.13) 3. This act shall take effect on the 30th day next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill raises the imposition threshold from $1 million to $1.5 million for the one percent Mansion Tax on real property transfers, with future adjustments tied to inflation. Currently, an additional one percent fee is applied to various types of property transactions, including residential, commercial, certain farm properties, and cooperative units, if the sale price exceeds $1 million.  There is also a tax on transfers of controlling interests in entities that own commercial property, with this tax applying when the propertys value exceeds $1 million as well. This bill increases the threshold for both the additional fee and the controlling interest transfer tax from $1 million to $1.5 million, beginning 30 days after the date of enactment of the bill.  Beginning on the July 1 of each subsequent year, the bill provides for the annual adjustment to this threshold amount based on the percent change in the Consumer Price Index over the 12-month period, beginning April 1 and ending March 31, immediately preceding the period in which the adjustment would apply.  Under the bill, the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury would be required to determine and publish the amount of the adjustment, together with the threshold amount for the imposition of tax, by no later than May 1 of each year the threshold will be adjusted annually based on inflation, using the Consumer Price Index to reflect the rising costs of living.  The Director of the Division of Taxation will be responsible for determining and publishing the new threshold by May 1 each year. Specifically, the bill defines the Consumer Price Index as the average of the annual increase, expressed as a percentage, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers in the New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan statistical areas, as reported by the United States Department of Labor.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.118, s.13) 3. This act shall take effect on the 30th day next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill raises the imposition threshold from $1 million to $1.5 million for the one percent Mansion Tax on real property transfers, with future adjustments tied to inflation. Currently, an additional one percent fee is applied to various types of property transactions, including residential, commercial, certain farm properties, and cooperative units, if the sale price exceeds $1 million.  There is also a tax on transfers of controlling interests in entities that own commercial property, with this tax applying when the propertys value exceeds $1 million as well. This bill increases the threshold for both the additional fee and the controlling interest transfer tax from $1 million to $1.5 million, beginning 30 days after the date of enactment of the bill.  Beginning on the July 1 of each subsequent year, the bill provides for the annual adjustment to this threshold amount based on the percent change in the Consumer Price Index over the 12-month period, beginning April 1 and ending March 31, immediately preceding the period in which the adjustment would apply.  Under the bill, the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury would be required to determine and publish the amount of the adjustment, together with the threshold amount for the imposition of tax, by no later than May 1 of each year the threshold will be adjusted annually based on inflation, using the Consumer Price Index to reflect the rising costs of living.  The Director of the Division of Taxation will be responsible for determining and publishing the new threshold by May 1 each year. Specifically, the bill defines the Consumer Price Index as the average of the annual increase, expressed as a percentage, in the consumer price index for all urban consumers in the New York City and Philadelphia metropolitan statistical areas, as reported by the United States Department of Labor.
