STATEMENT This resolution strongly condemns policy brutality and the excessive use of force by law enforcement officers. Recent events have brought attention to the tragic deaths of unarmed Black men and women, and other people of color, due to police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement.  These abuses have led to community destabilization and a decrease in public safety. On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46 year-old unarmed Black man, died after being pinned down by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota; his alleged offense was using a counterfeit $20 bill.  The death of George Floyd sparked ongoing protests in all 50 states and many countries around the world.  In addition to Mr. Floyd, countless other lives have been lost as a result of police brutality and the excessive use of force by law enforcement. Police brutality and excessive use of force disproportionately affect people of color, particularly Black people, and are among the leading causes of death of young men of color. People with disabilities and other historically marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, immigrants, and those experiencing homelessness also are significantly more likely to be victims of police violence. Excessive use of force, which can include shootings, brutal beatings, fatal chokings, and any other excessive treatment, violates the constitutional rights of those affected.  These actions must be condemned, and the constitutional rights of those who fall victim to these abuses must be protected.
