STATEMENT This bill implements various measures to strengthen access to reproductive health care services in the State and establishes the Reproductive Health Care Access Fund to address those purposes. The fund will be used for the following purposes: (1 Reproductive Health Care Clinical Training Program; (2) Reproductive Health Care Security Grant Program; and (3) Reproductive Health Care Facility Loan Program. The purpose of the Reproductive Health Care Clinical Training Program established in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety will be to protect access to reproductive health care by ensuring that there are sufficient number of health care professionals to provide reproductive health care services. For instance, the program will ensure that the coordinating organization has demonstrated experience in coordinating health care training programs for reproductive health care services and family planning services. The coordinating organization will also be responsible for administering grants to develop and sustain reproductive health care services. The bill provides that the Reproductive Health Care Security Grant Program in the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness will make available grants to eligible reproductive health care facilities which the Director of the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness determines are at a high risk of being the target of unlawful activity, including acts of violence, property damage, vandalism, cyber attacks, and harassment. Grants provided under the program will be used to hire security personnel and target-hardening equipment. Further, the Reproductive Health Care Facility Loan Program will award loans to eligible reproductive health care facilities that provide reproductive health care services. Under the bill, loans awarded will be used to support establishing or renovating existing health care facilities, investments in technology to facilitate care, the recruitment and retention of staff, and other operational needs that increase reproductive health care services. The bill requires that the Department of Health conduct a Statewide needs assessment to examine the gaps in access and delivery of reproductive health care services in the State, including the impact that out-of-State restrictions have had on the need for reproductive health care services and the provider network in the State. Finally, the bill appropriates monies from the General Fund, subject to availability, to the Reproductive Health Care Access Fund. The FY 2024 Appropriations Act includes a $5 million appropriation for OBGYN Clinical Training Program to provide training to licensed members of the health care community. Another $5 million in FY 2024 is appropriated for the Reproductive Health Security Grant Program toward securing clinics. These grants support reproductive health care facilities that provide reproductive health care with target hardening support. The FY 2024 Governors Budget recommends language in which the Office of Homeland Security Preparedness will receive reimbursement to administer the grant.
