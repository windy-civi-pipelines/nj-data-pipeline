For a contract where only one State agency uses the contract, the State Contract Manager shall be responsible for engaging the contractor, assuring that purchase orders are issued to the contractor, directing the contractor to perform the work of the contract, approving the deliverables and approving payment vouchers.  The State Contract Manager shall be the person that the contractor contacts after the contract is executed for answers to any questions and concerns about any aspect of the contract.  The State Contract Manager shall be responsible for coordinating the use and resolving minor disputes between the contractor and the State agency. If the contract has multiple users, the director may designate the State Contract Manager for that contract.  The State Contract Manager shall be the central coordinator of the use of the contract for all using agencies, while other State employees engage and pay the contractor.  All persons and agencies that use the contract shall notify and coordinate the use of the contract with the State Contract Manager. The State Contract Manager shall have the following additional duties: if the State Contract Manager determines that the contractor has failed to perform the required work and is unable to resolve that failure to perform directly with the contractor, the State Contract Manager shall file a formal complaint with the contract compliance unit in the Division of Purchase and Property and request that office to assist in the resolution of the contract performance problem with the contractor; the State Contract Manager shall be responsible for arranging for contract extensions and preparing any re-procurement of the contract with the Purchase Bureau; the State Contract Manager shall be responsible for obtaining permission from the director to reduce the scope of work, amend the contract or add work or special projects to the contract after contract award; the State Contract Manager shall be responsible for completion of a project performance assessment form for submission to the division, with a copy to the Office of Management and Budget; and the State Contract Manager shall be responsible for submitting the contractor final deliverables to the Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The State Contract Manager shall also be responsible for monitoring that all certified businesses formally identified as subcontractors by prime contractors on State contracts are contracted to complete work within their identified area of expertise.  Throughout the duration of the State contract, the State Contract Manager shall monitor and document on a routine basis the use of the identified certified businesses. If at any time during the contract duration any of the previously identified certified businesses are no longer performing as subcontractors, the State Contract Manager shall require the prime contractor to formally submit their reasoning for no longer utilizing the previously identified certified business as a subcontractor for the work. Each State Contract Manager shall notify the Chief Diversity Officer on a quarterly basis of the number of instances when certified businesses formally identified as subcontractors by prime contractors are contracted to complete work outside their identified area of expertise.  The report shall include the name of the prime contractor, a description of the work of the certified business as a subcontractor, and how the work was outside the area of expertise of the certified business.
