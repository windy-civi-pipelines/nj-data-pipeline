Whereas, There are approximately five million veterans in the United States with a service-connected disability; and Whereas, Approximately 53,000 of New Jersey veterans have a service-connected disability; and Whereas, There are two medical centers operated by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in New Jersey, with one located in East Orange and one located in Lyons; and Whereas, Service-connected disabilities may adversely impact veterans abilities to access necessary medical care at these facilities; and Whereas, The VA Veterans Transportation Service is designed to provide qualifying veterans with free transportation to and from VA medical centers, but it is unclear if both New Jersey VA medical centers participate in this program; and Whereas, Disabled American Veterans and other veterans service organizations provide free van transportation to and from VA medical centers in New Jersey, but these non-profit organizations should not shoulder the responsibility to provide properly coordinated VA-funded patient transport for deserving veterans and qualified family members; and Whereas, It has been reported by numerous New Jersey veterans that the transportation service provided to these VA facilities is deficient, with veterans being left at facilities for hours, overnight, and in adverse weather conditions; and Whereas, Alternatively, each New Jersey county provides paratransit service for senior citizens and people with disabilities, however, many county paratransit services are not able to provide service across county borders due to limited funding; and Whereas, There are also a number of non-profit social service organizations, such as the ARC of New Jersey and Easterseals New Jersey, that provide high quality paratransit service to their clients in this State with funding through Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements; and Whereas, These high quality county and non-profit paratransit providers may be able to expand their coverage to meet the transportation needs of veterans traveling to and from VA facilities if provided funding to cover the cost of such an expansion; and Whereas, New Jersey is grateful for the sacrifices that veterans have made in service to this nation, and recognizes that they may have sacrificed their health in their service and deserve to be taken care of during and after their service; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully urges the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to end its financial relationships with transportation providers in New Jersey that are responsible for the inadequate service that is currently provided to transport disabled New Jersey veterans to VA facilities, and instead use that funding to form relationships with county paratransit agencies or existing New Jersey non-profit social service organizations with high quality paratransit service capacity so that those entities can expand quality paratransit service to New Jerseys disabled veterans. 2.  Copies of this Assembly resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. STATEMENT This resolution urges the United State Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to utilize and fund existing paratransit transportation networks to transport disabled veterans to and from its New Jersey medical centers. Approximately five million veterans in the United States have a service-connected disability, and about 53,000 of those veterans live in New Jersey.  The VA operates two medical centers in New Jersey, with one in East Orange and one in Lyons.  Service-connected disabilities can adversely impact veterans abilities to access necessary medical care at these facilities. Currently, the VA provides transportation service via the Veterans Transportation Service, but this service has limitations that can result in the reduced efficiency of transporting disabled veterans to and from medical appointments.  Disabled American Veterans and other veterans service organizations also provide free van transportation to and from VA medical centers in New Jersey, but these non-profit organizations should not shoulder the responsibility to provide properly coordinated VA-funded patient transport for deserving veterans and qualified family members. It has also been reported by numerous New Jersey veterans that the transportation service provided to these VA facilities is deficient, with veterans being left at facilities for hours, overnight, and in adverse weather conditions. Both New Jersey counties and non-profit social service organizations have existing paratransit transportation for use by senior citizens and individuals with disabilities.  These high quality county and non-profit paratransit providers may be able to expand their coverage to meet the transportation needs of veterans traveling to and from VA facilities if provided funding to cover the cost of such an expansion.
