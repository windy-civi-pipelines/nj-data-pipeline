The monies credited to the fund shall not be used for any purpose other than those purposes set forth in this section and section 14 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2B:1-9).

STATEMENT The 21st Century Improvement Fund, section 14 of P.L.2014. c.31 (C.2B:1-9), is a dedicated, nonlapsing fund annually credited with a sum equal to the yearly revenue derived from the incremental amounts of certain fees payable to the court.  One of the dedicated purposes of the fund is the development, maintenance and administration of the Statewide digital e-court information system.  Presently, the e-court system broadly includes public access to digital court matters.  This bill would expand the public access function to include access to court matters generally, including an individualized account access and notification system for individuals using email addresses and telephone numbers about pending court matters including but not limited to violations and court dates. The bill further amends section 14 of P.L.2014. c.31 (C.2B:1-10) to ensure that a portion of the funds allocated for the development, maintenance and administration of a Statewide digital e-court information system shall be used for expanded purpose. It is the sponsors view that enhanced notification technology can lead to increased access and accessibility to the court system which, in turn, can prevent such issues as missed court dates and failure to settle matters, arrests, warrant issues and arrests for individuals.  The use of notification technology at the account is used in such areas as online banking and notifications about health and self-care appointments, and should be available to individuals involved at all levels the justice system.
