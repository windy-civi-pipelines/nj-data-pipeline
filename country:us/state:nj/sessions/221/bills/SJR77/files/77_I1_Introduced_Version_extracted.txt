STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of November of each year as Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness Month in New Jersey to raise public awareness about hospice and palliative care and to encourage the citizens of the State to increase their understanding of supportive, high-quality, end-of-life care before they or members of their families are confronted with a health care crisis or terminal diagnosis. Every year throughout the United States, 1.6 million people living with a terminal diagnosis receive hospice and palliative care, but more can be done to educate members of the public about the benefits of such care.  At the center of hospice and palliative care is the belief every person has the right to die pain-free and with dignity.  The role of hospice and palliative care workers and volunteers is to provide improved quality of life to patients and caregivers coping with life-limiting illness, and to allow an individual to focus on living as fully as possible even as life draws to a close. The joint resolution requests that the Governor issue an annual proclamation calling upon public officials and the residents of this State to observe Hospice and Palliative Care Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs.
