STATEMENT This bill supplements the FY 2024 Appropriations Act with a net additional amount of spending authority that totals $13,430,000.  The net total consists of $37,430,000 in additional spending and $24,000,000 in reduced spending.  The bill also adjusts certain language provisions in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act and adds new language provisions related to certain items of spending. Department of Corrections: This bill appropriates $9,800,000 in Direct State Services funding to the Department of Corrections for Materials and Supplies.  The additional funding is needed to address increased costs related to food for incarcerated persons as well as fuel and utility costs. The increased funding under this bill for the Department of Corrections is from the General Fund. Department of Human Services This bill appropriates an additional $16,411,000 to the Department of Human Services, with $12,111,000 of the total being appropriated from the General Fund and the remaining $4,300,000 being appropriated from the Property Tax Relief Fund. Of the $12,111,000 in additional spending from the General Fund, $4,193,000 is appropriated as State Aid for the Supplemental Security Income Program due to higher than anticipated regular assistance costs.  The remaining $7,918,000 in State Aid funding from the General Fund is provided for the General Assistance Program due to higher than anticipated costs for the programs employable recipients. The bills additional $4,300,000 in State Aid spending from the Property Tax Relief Fund is appropriated for Support of Patients in County Psychiatric Hospitals due to an increase in the States share of costs for patients in county psychiatric hospitals. The bill also adds a new language provision in the Department of Human Services portion of the FY 2024 Appropriations Act.  The language allows funding received in the Health Care Affordability and Accessibility Fund to be appropriated to support NJ FamilyCare. Department of the Treasury: This bill de-appropriates $24,000,000 in Grants-in-Aid funding from the General Fund for Jersey City Redevelopment Agency  Art Museum Project due to a lack of sustainable resources for future ongoing costs. The bill also adds two language provisions in the Department of the Treasury portion of the FY 2024 Appropriations Act.  One language provision allows existing funding for the New Jersey Economic Development Authoritys Film-Lease Partner Facility Investments program to be used for programs, projects, and initiatives that support the film and digital media industry.  The existing funding was appropriated as part of P.L.2023, c.97 to make capital investments in New Jersey film-lease partner facilities.  The other new language provision added to the FY 2024 Appropriations Act by this bill allows existing funding for the New Jersey Economic Development Authoritys Real Estate Projects Funding program to be reallocated to the Economic Recovery Fund  Strategic Innovation Centers and Maternal and Infant Health Innovation Center. Department of Education: This bill appropriates a total of $11,219,000 in State Aid funding to the Department of Education from the Property Tax Relief Fund.  Of this total amount, $6,764,000 is appropriated as additional Equalization Aid in order to fulfill the provisions of P.L.2023, c.140.  This law provides an exemption from reductions in State school aid for certain regional school districts that meet criteria enumerated in the law related to mitigated regionalization costs, administrative spending per pupil, and increases in the general fund tax levy. The other $4,455,000 in additional State Aid funding to the Department of Education is appropriated as additional Transportation Aid due to increased nonpublic transportation costs. The bill also adjusts a language provision in the FY 2024 Appropriations Act related to Preschool Education Aid to clarify that the Department of Education may support workforce preparation and training and other ancillary needs related to preschool expansion. Department of Health: The bill adds a new language provision to the Department of Health portion of the FY 2024 Appropriations Act.  The language provision allows necessary funds to be transferred from the department to the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services to support Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Healths participation in the Medicaid Access to Physician Services program.
