<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish
additional specific factors to be used in calculating the municipal adjustment
for a municipalitys fair share affordable housing obligation.  The bill also
caps the number of units a municipality may have allocated as its affordable
housing obligation with regard to the size of the municipal population.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The additional factors to be
used in calculating the municipal adjustment are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) population of the
municipality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) water supply and sewerage
capacity in the municipality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) school class sizes and
school services in the municipality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) public safety services in
the municipality; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e) public transportation and
traffic in the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a municipal
adjustment if maintaining approximately the same school class sizes would be a
significant cost or if adequate school, public safety, and public transportation
resources are not available or would be a significant cost to provide.  A
municipal adjustment would also have to be made if present traffic conditions
would be substantially disrupted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The additional municipal
adjustment factors required by the bill would require a more holistic
examination of the actual state of affairs in a municipality, as well as of the
potential impacts of additional development, in calculating its fair share
affordable housing obligation.  This will help ensure that reasonable numbers
are arrived at that will not be disruptive to the quality of life and provision
of local government services in a municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bills population cap
would protect those municipalities that may face dramatic municipal population
increases if mandated to add a large amount of additional affordable housing.  Current
law provides that no municipality shall be required to address a fair share of
affordable housing units beyond 1,000 low and moderate income units within 10
years from the grant of substantive certification; except that a municipality
may be allocated more than 1,000 units, if based upon an evidentiary hearing,
it is found likely that the municipality through its zoning powers could create
a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low and moderate income units
within that 10-year period.  In order to prevent the disparate impact such a
potentially large affordable housing mandate can create for municipalities with
small populations, this bill provides that an allocation of units to a
municipality as its fair share shall not exceed an amount that would result in
an increase of the municipal population by more than five percent.</p>
