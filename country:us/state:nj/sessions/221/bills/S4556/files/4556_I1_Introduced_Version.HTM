will not knowingly violate or permit to be violated any of the provisions of
the law applicable to the retirement system.  Such oath shall be subscribed by
the member taking it, and certified by the official before whom it is taken,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill reinstates automatic
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for annual pension, ordinary disability
pension, or accidental disability pension retirement benefits for certain
members of the State Police Retirement System (SPRS).  Provisions contained in
P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-16 et al.), signed into law on June 28, 2011, had
suspended the automatic annual adjustment for current and future retirees and
beneficiaries of the SPRS and other State-administered retirement systems until
those systems reach a target funded ratio.  Decades of underfunding those
systems by the State had placed the systems in precarious financial conditions.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although this bill does not
reinstate COLAs for other retirees, this bill serves as an initial step in
reinstating COLAs for all retirees of the State-administered retirement
systems.  Through the prioritization of the SPRS, the State will begin this
process with retired State police to provide them greater financial security
and stability at a time when inflation has significantly eroded the value of
their retirement benefit payments, which are already based on the lower
salaries of years ago.  To that end, the bill includes restrictions intended to
limit costs and focus on segments among retirees of the SPRS expected to be
most in need of an immediate benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, members of the
SPRS will receive automatic COLAs for annual pension, ordinary disability
pension, and accidental disability pension benefits if the member has been
retired and receiving retirement benefits for a minimum of ten years. 
Longer-term retirees generally will have lower pension benefits and be less
able to obtain employment to offset the erosion of their benefits.  Members of the
SPRS who are hired more than 30 days following the effective date of this act
will not be considered eligible to receive these automatic COLAs.  The COLAs
will only apply to future pension benefit payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The adjustment in eligible
members pension benefits will be calculated based on an amount up to $75,000
of a retirees benefit for the first year following the enactment of this
bill.  Eligible members receiving up to $75,000 of pension benefits will
receive a COLA tied to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. 
This will ensure that greater initial benefits will be provided to those likely
to be most in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The adjustment in eligible
members pension benefits will be limited to one percent if the member receives
more than $75,000 in benefits for the first year following the enactment of the
bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After the first calendar year
following the enactment of the bill, the $75,000 threshold will be adjusted
annually according to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,
except that the adjustment will be calculated at a rate not to exceed three
percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also grants the
cost-of-living adjustment to the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a
surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary that is provided by SPRS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the Board
of Trustees of SPRS fails to comply with the provisions of this bill within six
months following the effective date, then the State Treasurer will be
responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Legislature to appropriate monies from the General Fund as necessary to
effectuate the cost-of-living adjustments established under the bill.  The bill
further provides that this appropriation will take precedence over any
additional funding added to the annual State budget by the Legislature through
resolutions or through changes to the Governors budget message.  </p>
