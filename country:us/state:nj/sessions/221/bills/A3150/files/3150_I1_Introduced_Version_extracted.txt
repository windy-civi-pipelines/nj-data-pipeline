N.J.S.A.38:23-4.1 defines emergency for the purposes of N.J.S.A.38:23-4, which provides that a public employee who enters the active military service of the United States or of this State in time of war or emergency must be granted a leave of absence for that service and for three months after receiving a discharge from service.  If the public employee is incapacitated by injury or sickness at the time of discharge, the leave must be extended until three months after the employees discharge, or until the expiration of two years from the date of discharge. N.J.S.A.38:23-4 also provides that during the leave, the employee cannot be terminated or laid off if entry into the military occurred in time of war or emergency.  During the period of leave, the employee is entitled to all the rights, privileges and benefits of the public employment.  The leave may be granted with or without pay.  The employee is entitled to resume the employment if he applies before the expiration of the leave.  The bill defines emergency for the purposes of this statute to include any period of time from September 11, 2001 until the termination of the Global War on Terrorism as declared by the President of the United States. Finally, the bill requires public employers to prepare and maintain written policies and procedures to be followed with regard to leaves of absence by officers and employees who are members of the Armed Forces of the United States and the reserve components thereof, including the National Guard.  The policies must specify documentation requirements for leave, and the receipt of required documentation must be acknowledged in writing by the public employer.  The policies and procedures must be applied in a uniform and fair manner.  Notice of any changes to the policies and procedures must be given promptly to all affected officers and employees and training must be provided to ensure proper implementation and administration.  Upon receipt of a request for a leave or absence by an officer or employee, the public employer must inform an officer or employee in writing, within 90 days after the receipt, of any issues or matters regarding the leave request.  If the employer does not notify the officer or employee within such time period, the employer will be permanently barred from raising any such issue or matter, or charging the officer or employee with an administrative violation.  A public employer must provide a full accounting to an officer or employee of all matters regarding pay within a reasonable period of time and in a reasonable manner.  All records for each officer or employee must be maintained by the public employer for a period of not less than 10 years.  If in any action brought in a court of law by an officer or employee, a public employer is found to be in violation of any statutes concerning the employment, compensation, or leave of absence of a public officer or employee who served as a member of the United States Armed Forces or the National Guard, the court must award to the officer or employee reasonable attorneys fees and other fees and costs.
