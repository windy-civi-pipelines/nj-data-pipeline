<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes various
changes to the laws concerning termination, compensation, and leaves of absence
of certain active and retired members of the United States military, the
reserves, and the National Guard who are public employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     N.J.S.A.38:23-1 requires a
public employer to provide a paid leave of absence for federal active duty to
public employees who are members of the reserves of the United
  States military, including the National Guard of other states.  The employer
must provide paid leave for 30 work days per year.  Leave after 30 days is
provided without pay.  Also, N.J.S.A.38A:4-4 requires a public employer to
provide a paid leave of absence for State or federal active duty to public
employees who are members of the New Jersey National Guard.  The employer must
provide paid leave for 90 work days per year.  Leave after 90 days is provided
without pay.  This bill provides that the public employee would be entitled to
pay for the days over 30 or the days over 90, as appropriate, if pay is
provided in an applicable collective negotiations agreement in effect at the
time of the leave of absence.  If an applicable collective negotiations
agreement is not in effect or does not address this matter or a person is not
covered by a collective negotiations agreement, the officer or employee will be
entitled to pay only if the public employer decides to provide it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Also for the purposes of
N.J.S.A.38A:4-4, the bill permits a public employee to use, at the employees
sole discretion, accrued paid leave for State and federal active duty as a
member of the New Jersey National Guard and the employer cannot require an
employee to use that time for leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of
N.J.S.A.38:23-1, this bill entitles a public employee, during the leave of
absence, to payment by the public employer, on behalf of the employee, of any
contribution required of the officer or employee to a retirement system or
program and to a health care benefits plan or program, in addition to any
contribution or payment required of the public employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of
N.J.S.A.38:23-1, this bill entitles a public employee to: (1) leave for one
travel day to the active duty location if the officer or employee resides 50 or
more miles from the location of duty and checks in to lodgings at or near the
duty location for the purpose of resting prior to undertaking the military
service obligation; and (2) leave, prior to undertaking the military service
obligation, of five days if the length of service will be 30 to 180 days, and
of ten days if the length of service will be 181 days or more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Also for the purposes of
N.J.S.A.38:23-1, the bill defines Federal active duty to mean:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     the performance of duty on a
voluntary or involuntary basis in a uniformed service under competent
authority, including active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty
for training, and inactive duty training;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     service on a full time basis
in the National Guard; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     time for medical appointments
and consultations, surgery, counseling for post traumatic stress disorder,
recuperation, rehabilitation, and recovery from an injury sustained or
aggravated as a result of military service; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     time for an examination to
determine fitness for performing funeral honors duty as authorized by federal
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     N.J.S.A.38:23-4.1 defines
emergency for the purposes of N.J.S.A.38:23-4, which provides that a public
employee who enters the active military service of the United States or of this
State in time of war or emergency must be granted a leave of absence for that
service and for three months after receiving a discharge from service.  If the
public employee is incapacitated by injury or sickness at the time of
discharge, the leave must be extended until three months after the employees
discharge, or until the expiration of two years from the date of discharge. 
N.J.S.A.38:23-4 also provides that during the leave, the employee cannot be
terminated or laid off if entry into the military occurred in time of war or
emergency.  During the period of leave, the employee is entitled to all the
rights, privileges and benefits of the public employment.  The leave may be
granted with or without pay.  The employee is entitled to resume the employment
if he applies before the expiration of the leave.  The bill defines emergency
for the purposes of this statute to include any period of time from September
11, 2001 until the termination of the Global War on Terrorism as declared by
the President of the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
public employers to prepare and maintain written policies and procedures to be
followed with regard to leaves of absence by officers and employees who are
members of the Armed Forces of the United States and the reserve components thereof,
including the National Guard.  The policies must specify documentation
requirements for leave, and the receipt of required documentation must be
acknowledged in writing by the public employer.  The policies and procedures
must be applied in a uniform and fair manner.  Notice of any changes to the
policies and procedures must be given promptly to all affected officers and
employees and training must be provided to ensure proper implementation and
administration.  Upon receipt of a request for a leave or absence by an officer
or employee, the public employer must inform an officer or employee in writing,
within 90 days after the receipt, of any issues or matters regarding the leave
request.  If the employer does not notify the officer or employee within such
time period, the employer will be permanently barred from raising any such
issue or matter, or charging the officer or employee with an administrative
violation.  A public employer must provide a full accounting to an officer or
employee of all matters regarding pay within a reasonable period of time and in
a reasonable manner.  All records for each officer or employee must be
maintained by the public employer for a period of not less than 10 years.  If
in any action brought in a court of law by an officer or employee, a public
employer is found to be in violation of any statutes concerning the employment,
compensation, or leave of absence of a public officer or employee who served as
a member of the United States Armed Forces or the National Guard, the court
must award to the officer or employee reasonable attorneys fees and other fees
and costs.  </p>
