For the purposes of this section, authorized representative means an employee of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development or the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance, as appropriate, operating within the scope of his or her normal responsibilities. (cf: P.L.1967, c.216, s.2) 2.    Within two months from the effective date of P.L.    c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Department of Labor and Workforce Development shall establish a procedure for an employer to request and obtain an opinion or ruling from the department stating the employers obligations under the overtime provisions in the "New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law," P.L.1966, c.113 (C.34:11-56a et seq.).  Upon written request from an employer for an opinion or ruling of the employers overtime obligations, including but not limited to, an electronic request submitted on the departments internet website, the department shall, within two weeks of receipt of the request, issue a written opinion or ruling stating the employers overtime obligations. The department shall prominently display on its internet website the procedure and all information, or a link to the information, required for an employer to submit a request for an opinion or ruling in accordance with this section. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that the good faith defense against violations of the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law based on an administrative regulation, ruling, approval, or interpretation by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or the Director of the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance be expanded to include: (1)   regulations, rulings, approval, or interpretation by the authorized representatives of the commissioner or director; (2)   opinions or rulings that the employer obtained from the department or the division stating the employers obligations under the overtime provisions in the "New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law; and (3)   rulings or determinations by a representative of the department or the division resulting from an investigation of the employers overtime practices that concludes that the employer did not commit a violation. Current law only provides the good faith defense for decisions made by the commissioner or the director themselves. For the purposes of this section, authorized representative means an employee of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development or the Division of Wage and Hour Compliance, as appropriate, operating within the scope of his or her normal responsibilities. The bill requires the DOLWD to establish a procedure for an employer to request and obtain an opinion or ruling from the department stating the employers obligations under the overtime provisions in the "New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law. This bill is in response to the issues raised by Branch v. Cream-O-Land Dairy, 459 N.J. Super. 529 (App. Div. 2019) concerning a violation of the law that was upheld as a violation because the corrective ruling which the violator sought regarding compliance was made by an employee of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and not the commissioner.
