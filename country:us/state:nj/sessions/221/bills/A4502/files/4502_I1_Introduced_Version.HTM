<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish
certain limited purchase and pricing exemptions within the context of the
States existing farmland preservation laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a general rule, and as
clarified in the bill, any farmland development easement that is proposed to be
acquired by the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC), or by a local
government unit or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, for farmland
preservation purposes, is to be purchased for a price that is equal to, or less
than, the easements appraised value, as determined in accordance with the
appraisal procedures set forth in existing law, at subsection c. of section 8
of the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50).  The bill would
establish certain exceptions to this general rule.  Specifically, the bill
would authorize State, local, or nonprofit purchasers of fee simple title to,
or of a development easement on, farmland to pay a final, negotiated purchase
price therefor which is in excess of the title or easements appraised value,
based on a determination that the title or easement is located on lands that
are uniquely situated or are otherwise unique in character or quality,
including, but not limited to, lands situated within a designated preservation area
of the Pinelands or Highlands Regions of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, in any case
where a local government unit is proposing to acquire fee simple title to, or a
development easement on, farmland using constitutionally dedicated moneys in
whole or in part, for a negotiated purchase price exceeding the appraised value
thereof, the local government unit would be required, under the bill, to submit
a copy of the proposed agreement of sale, to the governing body of the county
in which the development easement is located, before the agreement is finalized
and executed.  The governing body would then be required, within 30 days after
receipt of such proposed agreement, to adopt an ordinance approving or
disapproving the execution thereof and the acquisition of the title or
easement, pursuant thereto, at the enhanced and negotiated price set forth
therein.  Whenever the governing body of a county adopts an ordinance approving
the execution of such agreement, the ordinance would be required to contain
certain findings of fact, including, but not limited to, findings related to
the location, size, and appraised value and proposed purchase price of the fee
simple title or easement interests to be acquired, and findings identifying the
unique characteristics, qualities, or location of the land on which the fee
simple title or development easement is proposed to be acquired, including, but
not limited to, its location within a designated preservation area, which the
governing body of the county deems sufficient to justify and warrant the local
government units acquisition of the fee simple title or development easement, pursuant
to the bills local purchase and pricing exception, at a final, negotiated
purchase price exceeding the appraised value thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In any case where the State
Agriculture Development Committee (committee) or a qualified tax exempt
nonprofit organization is proposing to acquire fee simple title to, or a
development easement on, farmland using constitutionally dedicated moneys in
whole or in part, for a negotiated purchase price exceeding the appraised value
thereof, the committee or nonprofit would be authorized to proceed with such
transaction, provided that the county agriculture development board or
subregional agricultural retention board having jurisdiction over the relevant
farmland, as appropriate, has first held a hearing on the matter, in compliance
with all public hearing and comment requirements applicable thereto.  Within 30
days after the conclusion of any such hearing, the hearing board would be
required to issue a hearing report identifying certain findings of fact,
including, but not limited to, findings related to the location, size, and
appraised value and proposed purchase price of the fee simple title or easement
interests to be acquired, and findings identifying the unique characteristics,
qualities, or location of such land, including, but not limited to, its
location within a designated preservation area, which have been cited by the
proposed State or nonprofit purchaser, and by other members of the public, as
sufficient basis upon which to justify and warrant the committees or
nonprofits acquisition of the fee simple title or development easement at a
final, negotiated purchase price exceeding the appraised value thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would specify that,
at the conclusion of each such requisite hearing, the proposed State or
nonprofit purchaser will be immediately and statutorily authorized to execute a
finalized agreement of sale effectuating the acquisition, thereby, of such
title or easement at a purchase price exceeding the appraised value thereof. 
The authorization provided by the bill, in this regard, would be applicable
regardless of whether the hearing board has issued its findings of facts on the
matter, as required by the bills provisions.  Within 30 days after the
execution of any such final, negotiated sales agreement, the State or nonprofit
purchaser would be required to provide a copy of the signed agreement of sale
to the governing body of the county in which the farmland is situated. 
However, nothing in the bills provisions would be deemed to require such State
or nonprofit purchaser to obtain the approval of a hearing board, or the
approval of the governing body of the county, in order to finalize and execute
such an agreement of sale following the conclusion of the hearing required by
the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the foregoing
changes, the bill would also amend section 8 of P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50),
which identifies the various alternative appraisal and valuation methods that
may be used by State, local, and nonprofit purchasers to determine the fair
market value of fee simple title to, or a development easement on, farmland
that is proposed to be acquired thereby with farmland preservation moneys, in
order to clarify the first optional valuation method that is authorized to be
undertaken, for such purposes, thereunder.  This first valuation method
currently includes the authorized use, for such purposes, of the valuation
process, established at section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31), which is applicable
in cases where farmland development easements are proposed to be acquired by
county agriculture development boards.  The provisions of section 8 of
P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50), however, do not similarly authorize, or in any
other way reference, the appraisal process previously established at section 39
of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-39), which is applicable to the acquisition, by
qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations, of fee simple titles to, or
development easements on, farmland.  Accordingly, the bill would amend the law
to clarify that either such pre-existing valuation method, respectively
codified at C.4:1C-31 or at C.13:8C-39, as appropriate, may be used as the
first alternative means of land valuation for the purposes of the multi-pronged
appraisal process that is required to be undertaken, pursuant to section 8 of
P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-50), to determine the fair market value of fee simple
and lesser interests in farmland proposed to be acquired, in whole or in part,
with funds dedicated for farmland preservation purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
allow the State, local governments, and nonprofit organizations to negotiate a
purchase price above the appraisal for the purchase of a development easement
or fee simple title for farmland preservation purposes.  In many areas of the
State, due to low appraisals, the loss of farmland to development has occurred
because government entities cannot compete with offers by developers.  This
bill will level the playing field for certain farmland preservation purchases
while providing the public a transparent process.</p>
