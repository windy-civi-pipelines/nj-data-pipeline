<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 12 of P.L.1971,
c.136 (C.26:2H-12) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12. a. No health care service
or health care facility shall be operated unless it shall: (1) possess a valid
license issued pursuant to this act, which license shall specify the kind or
kinds of health care services the facility is authorized to provide; (2)
establish and maintain a uniform system of cost accounting approved by the
commissioner; (3) establish and maintain a uniform system of reports and audits
meeting the requirements of the commissioner; (4) prepare and review annually a
long range plan for the provision of health care services; and (5) establish
and maintain a centralized, coordinated system of discharge planning which
assures every patient a planned program of continuing care and which meets the
requirements of the commissioner which requirements shall, where feasible,
equal or exceed those standards and regulations established by the federal
government for all federally-funded health care facilities but shall not
require any person who is not in receipt of State or federal assistance to be
discharged against his will. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) Application for a
license for a health care service or health care facility shall be made upon
forms prescribed by the department.  The department shall charge a single,
nonrefundable fee for the filing of an application for and issuance of a
license and a single, nonrefundable fee for any renewal thereof, and a single,
nonrefundable fee for a biennial inspection of the facility, as it shall from
time to time fix in rules or regulations; provided, however, that no such
licensing fee shall exceed $10,000 in the case of a hospital and $4,000 in the
case of any other health care facility for all services provided by the
hospital or other health care facility, and no such inspection fee shall exceed
$5,000 in the case of a hospital and $2,000 in the case of any other health
care facility for all services provided by the hospital or other health care
facility.  No inspection fee shall be charged for inspections other than
biennial inspections.  Any surgical practice required to apply for licensure by
the department as an ambulatory care facility pursuant to P.L.2017, c.283 shall
be exempt from the initial and renewal license fees required by this section. 
The application shall contain the name of the health care facility, the kind or
kinds of health care service to be provided, the location and physical
description of the institution, and such other information as the department
may require. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  A license shall be issued
by the department upon its findings that the premises, equipment, personnel,
including principals and management, finances, rules and bylaws, and standards
of health care service are fit and adequate and there is reasonable assurance
the health care facility will be operated in the manner required by this act
and rules and regulations thereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  The department shall post
on its Internet website each inspection report prepared following an inspection
of a residential health care facility, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1953,
c.212 (C.30:11A-1) or licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.),
that is performed pursuant to this subsection, along with any other inspection
report prepared by or on behalf of the department for such facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If an inspection reveals a
serious health and safety violation at a residential health care facility, the
department shall post the inspection report, including the name of the facility
and the owner of the facility, on its website no later than 72 hours following
the inspection.  If a license of a residential health care facility is
suspended, the department shall post the suspension on its website no later
than 72 hours following the suspension.  The department shall update its
website to reflect the correction of a serious health and safety violation, and
the lifting of a suspension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department shall notify,
as soon as possible, the Commissioner of Human Services, or the commissioner's
designee, and the director of the county board of social services or county
welfare agency, as appropriate, in the county in which a residential health
care facility is located, of a serious health and safety violation at the
facility and of any suspension of a license to operate such facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the inspection
responsibilities under this subsection with respect to such facility are
transferred or otherwise assigned to another department, that other department
shall post on its Internet website each inspection report prepared following an
inspection of such facility performed pursuant to this subsection, along with
any other inspection report prepared by or on behalf of that department for
such facility, and shall comply with the other requirements specified in this
subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1998, c.43)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The commissioner may
amend a facility's license to reduce that facility's licensed bed capacity to
reflect actual utilization at the facility if the commissioner determines that
10 or more licensed beds in the health care facility have not been used for at
least the last two succeeding years. For the purposes of this subsection, the
commissioner may retroactively review utilization at a facility for a two-year
period beginning on January 1, 1990.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    If a prospective
applicant for licensure for a health care service or facility that is not
subject to certificate of need review pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et
al.) so requests, the department shall provide the prospective applicant with a
pre-licensure consultation.  The purpose of the consultation is to provide the
prospective applicant with information and guidance on rules, regulations,
standards and procedures appropriate and applicable to the licensure process. 
The department shall conduct the consultation within 60 days of the request of
the prospective applicant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law to the contrary, an entity that provides magnetic
resonance imaging or computerized axial tomography services shall be required
to obtain a license from the department to operate those services prior to
commencement of services, except that a physician who is operating such
services on the effective date of P.L.2004, c.54 shall have one year from the
effective date of P.L.2004, c.54 to obtain the license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the Healthcare
Finance Enhancement Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
Department of Health imposes an assessment on the gross receipts of ambulatory
care facilities with gross receipts over $300,000.  This assessment is imposed
at a rate of 2.95 percent on each facility that is subject to the assessment. 
The assessments on ambulatory care facilities collected under this law are to
be deposited in the Health Care Subsidy Fund established pursuant to section 8
of P.L.1992, c.160 (C.26:2H-18.58).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
to reduce this assessment rate from 2.95 percent to 2.5 percent in fiscal year
2026 and to extend the assessment to all ambulatory care facilities beginning
in fiscal year 2027.  The bill also eliminates the exemption from the
ambulatory care facility assessment for surgical practices beginning in fiscal
year 2026.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill increases the per
adjusted admission charge imposed on hospitals by the Department of Health from
$10 to $12.50 beginning on July 1, 2025, and extends the imposition of this
charge to non-public psychiatric hospitals. </p>
