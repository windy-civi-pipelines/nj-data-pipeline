(d)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1993, c.178). (e)   Nonresidents.  For taxable years to which a certification pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1993, c.320 (C.54A:2-1.2) applies, a nonresident taxpayer shall be allowed the same deduction for personal exemptions as a resident taxpayer.  However, if (1) the nonresident taxpayer's gross income which is subject to tax under this act is exceeded by (2) the gross income which the nonresident taxpayer would be required to report under this act if the taxpayer were a resident by more than $100.00, the taxpayer's deduction for personal exemptions shall be limited by the percentage which (1) is to (2). (cf: P.L.2019, c.146) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows a deduction of $1,000 from gross income to mental health care professionals who provided services in the State during the year. Mental health care professional means a taxpayer licensed or certified by the State to provide or administer mental health care. Gross income is the starting total from which taxpayers calculate their income tax liability. A deduction from gross income lowers the starting total and therefore lowers the taxpayers liability. It is the sponsors hope that this deduction will incentivize more people to become mental health care professionals and will incentivize mental health care professionals to practice in the State.
