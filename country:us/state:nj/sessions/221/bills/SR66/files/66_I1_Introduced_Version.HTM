STATEMENT This Senate Resolution urges the Governor to safely resume in-person services at the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. In-person services at the Department of Labor and Workforce Development have been closed since March of 2020. New Jerseys unemployment rate as of March 2021 was still 7.7 percent, and the State has only recovered 54 percent of the jobs lost in March and April of 2020 as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related shutdowns, meaning that many New Jersey residents require access to the Department of Labor and Workforce Developments services. Although many of the Department of Labor and Workforce Developments services are provided over the internet or the telephone, these services may not be as accessible for elderly clients, low-income clients, or clients with disabilities. The States numbers of new cases of COVID-19 and number of COVID-19 fatalities are decreasing, leading to a safer indoor work environment, and indoor capacity limits are scheduled to be raised on May 19th if there is no surge in cases prior to that date. A resumption of in-person services at many of the Departments agencies, including a resumption of in-person unemployment claim filings and a resumption of in-person services at One-Stop Career Centers, is in the best interests of the clientele that the Department of Labor and Workforce Development is designed to serve. Additionally, a resumption of in-person services at the Division of Unemployment Insurance would allow claimants who are victims of programming and technological glitches to more effectively redress their problems and receive their claims, and would allow the Division of Unemployment and other agencies to more effectively communicate with these victims. This resolution additionally calls for the Department of Labor and Workforce Development to fully staff all public-facing offices at all times.
