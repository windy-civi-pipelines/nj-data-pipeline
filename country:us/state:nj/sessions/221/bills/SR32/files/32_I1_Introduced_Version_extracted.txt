Throughout the month of May, the State of Israel and its citizens were under intense and consistent rocket and mortar attacks from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.  The attacks endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent Israelis. To defend itself, Israel commenced a defensive operation with the goal of disabling the infrastructure and armaments of the terrorist organizations.  There can be no question that Israel has the right to defend itself from all terrorist threats and that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad represent a continual threat to the people of Israel. Hamas and other terrorist organizations continue to neglect the task of building a lasting, peaceful, and democratic Palestinian-Arab nation, instead taking action to inflict pain and suffering on others.  For example, to prevent counter attacks and to generate an anti-Israel narrative around Israeli counter attacks, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad intentionally locate elements of their terrorist infrastructure in civilian population centers, including hospitals, schools, and houses of worship, thus using innocent civilians as human shields and tools for propaganda.  The spread of terrorism in the region threatens the life of every person living in the Middle East. This resolution: (1)   expresses strong and unwavering commitment to supporting the welfare, security, and survival of the State of Israel, and recognizes its right to act decisively in self-defense; (2)   reiterates that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations must end the rocket and mortar attacks against Israel, and verifiably dismantle their terrorist infrastructure; (3)   expresses condolences to innocent Israeli and Palestinian-Arab victims and their families; and (4)   calls on other American states to condemn Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorist organizations and recognize Israels right to act decisively in self-defense to protect its citizens.
