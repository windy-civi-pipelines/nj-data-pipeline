(2) does not discriminate in admissions on the basis of race, color, national origin, or religion; (3) does not teach or advocate any type of domestic subversion, including the violent overthrow of the government of the United States; and (4) requires criminal background checks on school employees in accordance with procedures established pursuant to P.L.1989, c.229 (C.18A:6-4.13 et seq.). b.    To be eligible to participate in the program, the nonpublic school shall also demonstrate its financial viability as follows: (1)   the nonpublic school shall provide the department with a financial information report completed by a certified public accountant that complies with the standards adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to section 11 of this act.  The scope of the report shall be limited to those records that the department determines to be necessary to make grant payments to the school; and (2)   the certified public accountant certifies that the report is free of material misstatements. c.     Except as otherwise provided pursuant to the provisions of this act, the department may not regulate the education programs of a participating nonpublic school.  The establishment of the program and the participation of nonpublic schools in the program shall not be construed to impose additional regulatory requirements on a nonpublic school beyond those reasonably necessary to enforce the provisions of this act.  A participating nonpublic school shall be provided with maximum flexibility in providing for the educational needs of students participating in the program. d.    The department shall list the participating nonpublic schools on the departments Internet website and update the list on the first Monday of each month.  The list shall include the address and contact information for each participating nonpublic school, including the Internet website of the school.  A participating nonpublic school shall notify the department in writing if it ceases operation or determines to end its participation in the program. 9.    In order to ensure academic accountability, a participating nonpublic school shall report on a regular basis to the parent or guardian of an eligible student on the students academic progress. 10.  The department may bar a nonpublic school from participating in the program if the department determines that the nonpublic school has failed to meet the eligibility requirements or has not met its educational responsibilities to eligible students or their parents or guardians.  In the event that the department determines that a nonpublic school is no longer permitted to participate in the program, the department shall immediately notify the parents or guardians of the eligible students enrolled in the nonpublic school. 11.  The State Board of Education shall adopt rules and regulations necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this act in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), including but not limited to: a.     the eligibility and participation of nonpublic schools, including timelines that maximize the participation of students and nonpublic schools; and b.    the calculation and distribution of education empowerment grants to eligible students. 12.  This act shall take effect in the second full school year after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill directs the Department of Education to oversee the implementation and execution of the New Jersey Property Tax Relief and Education Empowerment Program.  Under the program, an eligible student will qualify for an education empowerment grant to enroll in a participating nonpublic school.  The grant will equal the lesser of the participating nonpublic schools per pupil cost to educate and fees or 50 percent of the annual spending per pupil of the district in which the eligible student resides.  To be eligible, the student must be from a household with an income that does not exceed 3.70 times the federal poverty threshold for a family of four for the school year preceding the school year for which the education empowerment grant is initially distributed.  The 2018 federal poverty guidelines provide that for a family of four the poverty threshold is $25,100, so the income limit in the bill would be $92,870.  In addition the student must be eligible for enrollment in the resident school district in grades kindergarten through 12, must not be classified as eligible for special education programs and services pursuant to chapter 46 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, must not have been enrolled in a nonpublic school in the school year preceding the school year for which the education empowerment grant is initially distributed, and must have attended a public school for at least 100 days in the school year preceding the school year for which the education empowerment grant is initially distributed. A parent of a student who is accepted for admission to a participating nonpublic school must apply to the school district in which the student resides for the grant.  Upon verification of certain information, the district will disburse the grant amount directly to the participating nonpublic school. Savings generated from the program must be applied to property tax relief within the resident school district in the form of a reduced local school tax burden and a dollar-for-dollar increase in the homestead benefit program. A nonpublic school that wishes to participate in the program must apply to the department and demonstrate that it: · complies with all applicable health and safety codes; · does not discriminate in admissions on the basis of race, color, national origin, or religion; · does not teach or advocate any type of domestic subversion; and · requires criminal background checks on school employees. In order to participate in the program, a nonpublic school must also demonstrate its financial viability by providing the department a financial information report completed by a certified public accountant who must also certify that the report is free of material misstatements. The bill stipulates that the amount of any reduction in school district budgets as a result of the bills implementation must be used exclusively and for no other purpose than the reduction of the school tax levy portion of the property tax burden on individual taxpayers and business entities.
