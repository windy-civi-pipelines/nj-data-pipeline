<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning income eligibility for certain public
assistance, school nutrition, and higher education student financial assistance
programs, supplementing Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes and Titles 30, 48,
and 52 of the Revised Statutes, and making an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    Although the State
minimum wage has increased annually since 2019, rising from $8.85 per hour in
that year to $14.13 per hour in January 2023, with a further increase to $15.13
scheduled for January 2024, income eligibility standards for many public
assistance, school nutrition, and higher education student financial assistance
programs have not been revised accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    According to multiple
economic surveys, New Jersey residents have one of the highest costs of living
in the country; however, the State has not updated the income eligibility
standards for many State-run public assistance, school nutrition, and higher
education student financial assistance programs to reflect this fact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The additional income
attained by minimum wage earners since 2019 has been eroded by inflationary
pressures in recent years; however, because income eligibility standards for
many State public assistance, school nutrition, and higher education student
financial assistance programs have not increased along with the State minimum
wage, working families continue to struggle to afford such necessities as food,
rent, utilities, and clothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Given that minimum wage
earners continue to struggle to afford basic necessities, it is essential that
income eligibility standards for State-funded public assistance, school
nutrition, and higher education student financial assistance programs increase
in order to ensure a better quality of life for State residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The Commissioner of
Agriculture shall have the authority, within the scope of this section, to
increase the income eligibility standards, in the manner provided for by
subsection d. of this section, for any school nutrition program for which the
commissioner makes a determination pursuant to subsection b. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commissioner shall
review all school nutrition programs under the departments purview and
determine whether:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the department has the
authority, pursuant to State and federal law, to increase the income
eligibility standards for each program; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  a school nutrition
program, which is funded in whole or in part by a federal block grant, would
have sufficient funding under the block grant to provide benefits and services
for newly eligible beneficiaries subsequent to any increase in the programs
income eligibility standards that may be authorized by the commissioner
pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The review conducted by
the commissioner, pursuant to subsection b. of this section, shall include, at
a minimum, the following school nutrition programs:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the National School Lunch
Program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the federal School
Breakfast Program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  any summer meals
programs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  any other school
nutrition program administered by the department that the commissioner deems
appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    If the commissioner,
based upon the results of the review conducted pursuant to subsection b. of
this section, determines that the State has the statutory or regulatory
authority to increase the income eligibility standards for a school nutrition
program and, for any program funded in whole or in part by a federal block
grant, sufficient funding is available to increase the income eligibility
standards for the program, the commissioner shall increase the income
eligibility standards for each such program by an amount equal to the total
percentage increase in the State hourly minimum wage between January 1, 2019
and the effective date of this act, plus a cost of living adjustment in an
amount equal to the cost of living adjustment for federal Social Security
benefits for the calendar year in which the provisions of this act become
effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The commissioner shall
apply for such federal waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions
of this section and to continue to secure federal financial participation for
school nutrition programs for qualified low and moderate-income households.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Federal School Breakfast
Program, National School Lunch Program, and summer meals programs mean the
same as those terms are defined by section 2 of P.L.2022, c.104 (C.18A:33-3.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The Executive
Director of the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority shall have the
authority, within the scope of this section, to increase the income eligibility
standards, in the manner provided for by subsection d. of this section, for any
student financial assistance program for which the executive director makes a
determination pursuant to subsection b. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The executive director
shall review all higher education student financial assistance programs under
the authoritys purview and determine whether the authority may, pursuant to
State or federal law, increase the income eligibility standards for each
program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires certain
State departments, the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority (HESAA),
the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA), and the Board of
Public Utilities (BPU) to determine whether the State has the authority, under
State and federal law, to increase the income eligibility standards for various
public assistance, school nutrition, and higher education student financial
assistance programs, and to raise the income eligibility standards for each
program for which such State authority exists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the Executive
Directors of the HESAA and the NJHMFA, the President of the BPU, and the
Commissioners of Agriculture, Community Affairs, and Human Services, to
consider, as part of this programmatic review, whether any assistance program,
funded in whole or in part by a federal block grant, will have sufficient
federal resources to support additional participants who become newly-eligible
subsequent to an increase in the programs income eligibility standards.  Among
the programs that will be included in the review are: the Medicaid and NJ
FamilyCare programs, the State Rental Assistance Program, the federal School
Breakfast program, the tuition aid grant program, and the payment assistance
for gas and electric initiative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a department, the HESAA,
the NJHMFA, or the BPU determines that the State has the authority to raise
income eligibility standards for an assistance program and, for programs funded
by federal resources, sufficient funding is available to support additional
program participants, the department, the HESAA, the NJHMFA, or the BPU will
increase the programs income eligibility standards by an amount equal to the
total percentage increase in the State minimum wage between January 1, 2019 and
the bills effective date, plus a cost of living adjustment in an amount equal
to the cost of living adjustment for federal Social Security benefits for the
calendar year in which the bill becomes effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates from the
General Fund to the HESAA, the NJHMFA, the BPU, and each of the Departments of
Agriculture, Community Affairs, and Human Services, such sums as are necessary
to implement the requirements under the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent to
ensure that the States minimum wage earners retain eligibility for important
public assistance and higher education student financial assistance programs
subsequent to the statutory increases in the State minimum wage.  Although
minimum wage earners are now compensated at a higher rate than in 2019, recent
inflationary pressures have made it increasingly difficult for </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>these workers to afford such
essentials as food, clothing, and rent.  The sponsor believes that the State
must raise the income eligibility standards for essential public assistance,
school nutrition, and higher education student financial assistance programs so
that hard-working minimum wage earners can provide for their families.</p>
