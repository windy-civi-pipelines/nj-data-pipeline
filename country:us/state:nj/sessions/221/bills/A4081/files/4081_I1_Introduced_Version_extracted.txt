For example, an employer that does not pay appropriate wages may be subject to penalties under the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law or the wage payment law.  Under the bill, if the employer that is failing to pay appropriate wages also threatens an employee based on the employees immigration status to pressure the employee from reporting a violation, the employer would be subject to additional penalties.
