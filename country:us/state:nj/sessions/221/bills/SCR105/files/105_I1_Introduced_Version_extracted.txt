INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment dedicates an amount equal to the amount annually collected from an additional fee imposed on the registration of zero emission vehicles to the transportation trust fund account.  The transportation trust fund account is an account in the States General Fund that contains funds used only for the State transportation system. Starting July 1, 2025, the amendment requires an amount equal to the additional fee imposed on the registration of zero emission vehicles to be credited to the account. The amendment requires that the funds credited to the account be dedicated solely for transportation purposes. The amendment does not require the State to impose an additional registration fee on zero emission vehicles. The amendment does not change the standard registration fees imposed on all motor vehicles. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution would amend the State Constitution to dedicate certain revenues to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) starting July 1, 2025.  As required under the State Constitution, all revenues deposited into the TTF may only be used to support the State transportation system. Specifically, for each State fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2025 in which an additional motor vehicle registration fee is imposed on zero emission vehicles, this constitutional amendment requires an amount equivalent to the amount of revenue annually derived from the additional registration fee to be deposited into the TTF. This constitutional amendment does not require the State to impose a new fee on zero emission vehicles, nor does it change the standard registration fee that is currently imposed on all motor vehicles.  Rather, for each State fiscal year commencing on or after July 1, 2025, in which an additional registration fee on zero emission vehicles is imposed, the amendment requires certain amounts of these revenues to be used for transportation purposes.
