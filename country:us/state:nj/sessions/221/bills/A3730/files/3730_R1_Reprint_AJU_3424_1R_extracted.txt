(2) A childs parent, guardian, or other lawful custodian, or a consistent caretaker shall not be liable in a civil action brought pursuant to subsection b. of this section if a disclosure of the childs image is: (a) not prohibited by law; and (b) not made for the purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, humiliation, degradation, or monetary or commercial gain. For purposes of this paragraph: consistent caretaker means an individual who, without expectation of compensation: lived with a child for at least 12 months, unless the court finds good cause to accept a shorter period; regularly exercised physical care and supervision of the child; made decisions regarding the child solely or in cooperation with a parent, guardian, or other lawful custodian, or as a result of the parent being unable, unavailable, or unwilling to provide physical care and supervision for the child; and established a bonded and dependent relationship with the child with the express or implied support of the parent of the child, or without consent if no parent has been able, available, or willing to provide physical care and supervision; parent means a childs natural parent or other person recognized as a parent under the laws of this State. (3) The disclosure of an image of a person who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact, the exposed intimate parts of a person, or the undergarment-clad intimate parts of a person is not a matter of public concern or public interest solely because the person in the image is a public figure. (4) The provisions of this section do not alter, conflict, or establish any liability that is inconsistent with section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. s.230). (cf: P.L.2016, c.2, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately, and apply to any civil action filed based upon an actor who commits a violation or threatens to commit a violation of section 1 of P.L.2003, c.206 (C.2C:14-9) on or after that date.
