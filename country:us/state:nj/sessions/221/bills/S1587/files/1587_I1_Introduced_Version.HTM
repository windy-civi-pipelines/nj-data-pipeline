Innovation as a principal department in the Executive Branch of the State
government, supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, amending various
parts of the statutory law, and making an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Department of Commerce and Innovation
Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   New Jersey has
historically been a hub for business and industry in the United States, in
sectors that range from textiles and ceramics to pharmaceuticals and scientific
innovation, and it is the policy of this State to continue to be an economic
leader in this country. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   It is also the policy of
New Jersey to stimulate economic growth and development in ways that are
efficient and coordinated across all sectors, departments, and agencies;
however, this State has seen a decrease in coordination and centralization of
these efforts, starting with the abolishment of the Department of Commerce and
Economic Development (department) in 1998.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   With the abolishment of
the department, the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission, later
renamed the New Jersey Commerce Commission (commission), P.L.1998,
c.44,&nbsp;s.3&nbsp;(C.52:27C-63),&nbsp;amended by P.L.2007, c.253, s.26, was
established in but not of the Department of Treasury for the purpose of
streamlining the coordination of economic development in this State to meet the
demands of the 21st Century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   In 2008, the commission
was also abolished and its functions, duties, offices, and programs were
dispersed among several departments and agencies, with tourism responsibilities
transferred to the Department of State, and most other functions and duties
being transferred to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority),
an authority formerly housed within the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Some of the functions
and duties of the commission were transferred to the Division of Business
Assistance, Marketing, and International Trade, which was established within
the authority with the abolishment of the commission, and, in 2011, was itself
renamed the Business Action Center and transferred to the Department of State
through Executive Reorganization Plan No. 003-2011.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   With the State
governments gradual decentralization of economic growth policy and
administration, New Jersey has struggled to coordinate a cohesive policy
approach to attract and foster business, industry, and innovation in this
State, and in recent years has fallen behind other states, particularly in
science, technology, and engineering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature,
therefore, determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of this
State to establish a principal department within the Executive Branch to serve
as a centralized focus for business and industrial concerns, to serve as a
voice and advocate of the interests of the business and innovation community to
the Executive Branch and to the Legislature, to realign the functions and
duties of several State agencies in a coordinated manner to streamline the
administration of business assistance and innovation programs and policy, to
eliminate the confusion felt within the business community concerning the
myriad State programs and policy objectives that are difficult to navigate or
discover due to being spread across several State agencies and departments, and
to establish a strong, centralized business-centered State identity that will
again put New Jersey at the forefront of business, industry, and innovation in
this country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Department of Commerce and Innovation (department) as a principal department in
the Executive Branch of the State government. New Jersey has historically been
a hub for business and industry in the United States, in sectors that range
from textiles and ceramics to pharmaceuticals and scientific innovation, and it
is the policy of this State to continue to be an economic leader in this
country. It is also the policy of New Jersey to stimulate economic growth and
development in ways that are efficient and coordinated across all sectors, departments,
and agencies; however, this State has seen a decrease in coordination and
centralization of these efforts, starting with the abolishment of the
Department of Commerce and Economic Development (Commerce Department) in 1998.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With the abolishment of the
Commerce Department, the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission,
later renamed the New Jersey Commerce Commission (commission), was established
in but not of the Department of the Treasury for the purpose of streamlining
the coordination of economic development in this State to meet the demands of
the 21st Century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Yet, in 2008, the commission
was also abolished and its functions, duties, offices, and programs were
dispersed among several departments and agencies, with tourism responsibilities
transferred to the Department of State, and most other functions and duties
being transferred to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority),
an authority formerly housed within the Commerce Department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Some of the functions and duties
of the commission were transferred to the Division of Business Assistance,
Marketing, and International Trade, which was established within the authority
with the abolishment of the commission, and, in 2011, was itself renamed the
Business Action Center and transferred to the Department of State through
Executive Reorganization Plan No. 003-2011.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With the State governments
gradual decentralization of economic growth policy and administration, New
Jersey has struggled to coordinate a cohesive policy approach to attract and
foster business, industry, and innovation in this State, and in recent years
has fallen behind other states, particularly in science, technology, and
engineering. It is in the best interest of the citizens of this State to
establish a principal department within the Executive Branch to serve as a
centralized focus for business and industrial concerns, to serve as a voice and
advocate of the interests of the business and innovation community to the
Executive Branch and to the Legislature, to realign the functions and duties of
several State agencies in a coordinated manner to streamline the administration
of business assistance and innovation programs and policy, to eliminate the
confusion felt within the business community concerning the myriad State
programs and policy objectives that are difficult to navigate or discover due
to being spread across several State agencies and departments, and to establish
a strong, centralized business-centered State identity that will again put New Jersey
at the forefront of business, industry, and innovation in this country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The administrator and chief
executive officer of the department is to be a commissioner, who is to be known
as the Commissioner of Commerce and Innovation (commissioner), and who is to be
a person qualified by training and experience to perform the duties of the
office. The commissioner is to be appointed by the Governor, with the advice
and consent of the Senate, and is to serve at the pleasure of the Governor
during the Governor's term of office and until the appointment and
qualification of the commissioner's successor. The commissioner is to devote the
commissioners entire time to the duties of the office and is to receive a
salary as provided by law. Any vacancy occurring in the office of the
commissioner is to be filled in the same manner as the original appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department and the
commissioner are to be responsible for the activities of the State government
in the support and development of business, industry, and innovation through
aid, promotion, and advertising, domestic and foreign commerce, business and
technological growth, and any program as determined by the department. The
department and commissioner also are to be responsible for research and statistics
in the fields of commerce, business, and innovation and maintenance of a
business information service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Business Action Center in
the Department of State, the Economic Development Authority in but not of the
Department of the Treasury, and the New Jersey Commission on Science,
Innovation and Technology in but not of the Department of the Treasury, are to
be transferred, together with all functions, powers, and duties, to the
department. This bill amends existing law to add the commissioner to the board
of the authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that,
within three months of the effective date of this bill, after consultation with
all division directors, the State Treasurer, and the commissioners of
appropriate commissions and executive departments, including but not
necessarily limited to the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the
Department of State, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Office
of the Secretary of Higher Education, the commissioner is to prepare and submit
a report to the Governor and to the Legislature identifying: those functions
and duties currently exercised by other departments, divisions, agencies,
commissions, councils, boards, offices, or bureaus of State government relating
to commerce, economic development, and innovation that may be appropriately
transferred to the department and those functions and duties transferred to the
department pursuant to the provisions of this bill that may be appropriately
transferred to other departments. The transfers may be effectuated by executive
order or law, as the case may be.</p>
