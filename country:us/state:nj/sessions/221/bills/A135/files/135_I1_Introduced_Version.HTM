An Act establishing a Summer Earn and Learn Pilot Program in the Department of Education and supplementing chapter 6 of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     School closures and the transition to virtual instruction as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have impacted students and families across the State both inside the classroom and within the home; b.    Students have had to adapt to new learning challenges, while also lending additional support to their families in various ways, including providing support to younger siblings and taking on additional employment responsibilities; c.     As a result of these added responsibilities, students are often faced with having to decide between attending school and obtaining employment to supplement wages to help support their families; d.    The lack of access to in-person instruction and the added responsibilities shouldered by students over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in student learning loss across subject matter and grade level; e.     While the summer vacation period typically offers students the opportunity to obtain employment both for financial compensation and exposure to different jobs and industries, providing students with access to supplemental learning assistance over summer vacation will allow students and school districts, charter schools, and renaissance schools to address COVID-19-related learning loss; and f.     The Summer Earn and Learn Pilot Program will provide students with access to supplemental learning assistance and help students obtain career-building employment opportunities so that students need not choose between financial security and attending school. 2.    As used in this act: Career-building employment opportunity means employment with a private or governmental agency or entity, taking place over summer vacation during the time-periods in which a student is not engaged in supplemental learning assistance under the Summer Earn and Learn Pilot Program established pursuant to section 3 of this act. Good academic standing means a grade point average of a 3.0 or higher on a scale of 4.0, or its equivalent. Pilot program means the Summer Earn and Learn Pilot Program established pursuant to section 3 of this act. Supplemental learning assistance means a course of instruction, taking place for at least three hours, five days a week over the summer vacation, both virtually or in-person, designed to help address COVID-19-related learning loss. 3.    a.  There is established in the Department of Education a three-year Summer Earn and Learn Pilot Program.  The purpose of the pilot program shall be to ensure that school districts, charter schools, and renaissance schools have the ability to provide students access to supplemental learning assistance and paid career-building employment opportunities. b.    The Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, shall develop guidelines governing the implementation of the pilot program and shall distribute the guidelines to each school district, charter school, and renaissance school in the State.  The guidelines shall include information concerning: (1)   the student application procedure for admittance into the pilot program that includes the eligibility criteria required pursuant to section 5 of this act; (2)   the subject matter to be included as part of the supplemental learning assistance; (3)   the type of work that may be performed as part of a career-building employment opportunity, which shall include, but need not be limited to, providing tutoring services to students throughout the State.  A student that seeks to obtain a career-building employment opportunity that involves providing tutoring services to students throughout the State shall be in good academic standing while enrolled in the pilot program; (4)   the agencies and entities with which a student may engage in career-building employment opportunities; (5)   performance standards related to the career-building employment opportunities, including the total number of hours of employment a student may perform as part of the pilot program; (6)   the total stipend amount to be provided to a student and the process by which the stipend shall be paid to a student over the course of the pilot program.  Such stipend amount shall be based upon student age and shall be at a rate of not less than the State minimum wage rate as of January 1 of each year in which the pilot program is offered; and (7)   any other information the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, deems necessary. c.     (1)  The Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, shall establish partnerships with private and governmental agencies and entities in order to assist students in obtaining career-building employment opportunities under the pilot program.
