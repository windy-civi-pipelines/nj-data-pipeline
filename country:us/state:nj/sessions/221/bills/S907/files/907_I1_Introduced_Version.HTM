<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 32 of P.L.2019,
c.153 (C.24:6I-25) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     32.  a.  There is hereby
established in the commission an Office <a name="_Hlk57219096">of Minority,
Disabled Veterans, <u>Disability-Owned,</u> and Women Medical Cannabis Business
Development</a>.  The office shall be under the immediate supervision of a
director.  The director of the office shall be appointed by the Governor, and
shall serve at the pleasure of the appointing Governor during the Governor's
term of office and until a successor has been duly appointed and qualified. 
Any vacancy in the directorship occurring for any reason other than the
expiration of the director's term of office shall be filled for the unexpired
term only in the same manner as the original appointment.  The director shall
receive an annual salary as provided by law which shall be at an amount not to
exceed the annual salary of the executive director of the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  The office shall
establish and administer, under the direction of the commission, unified
practices and procedures for promoting participation in the medical cannabis
industry by persons from socially and economically disadvantaged communities,
including by prospective and existing ownership of minority businesses<u>,
disability-owned businesses,</u> and women's businesses, as these terms are
defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18), and disabled
veterans' businesses as defined in section 2 of P.L.2015, c.116 (C.52:32-31.2),
to be issued medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer,
medical cannabis dispensary, and clinical registrant permits.  These unified
practices and procedures shall include the certification and subsequent
recertification at regular intervals of a business as a minority or women's
business, <u>disability-owned business,</u> or a disabled veterans' business,
in accordance with eligibility criteria and a certification application process
established by the commission through regulation in consultation with the
office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The office shall conduct
advertising and promotional campaigns, and shall disseminate information to the
public, to increase awareness for participation in the medical cannabis
industry by persons from socially and economically disadvantaged communities. 
To this end, the office shall sponsor seminars and informational programs, and
shall provide information on its</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Internet website, providing
practical information concerning the medical cannabis industry, including
information on business management, marketing, and other related matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  The office shall
develop, recommend, and implement policies, practices, protocols, standards,
and criteria designed to promote the formulation of medical cannabis business
entities and participation in the medical cannabis industry by persons from socially
and economically disadvantaged communities, including by promoting applications
for, and the issuance of, medical cannabis cultivator, medical cannabis
manufacturer, medical cannabis dispensary, and clinical registrant permits to
certified minority, women's, <u>disability-owned,</u> and disabled veterans'
businesses.  The office shall evaluate the effectiveness of these measures by
considering whether the measures have resulted in new medical cannabis
cultivator, medical cannabis manufacturer, and medical cannabis dispensary
permits being issued in accordance with the provisions of subsection g. of
section 12 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-7.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The office shall
periodically analyze the total number of permits issued by the commission as
compared with the number of certified minority, women's, <u>disability-owned,</u>
and disabled veterans' businesses that submitted applications for, and that
were awarded, such permits.  The office shall make good faith efforts to
establish, maintain, and enhance the measures designed to promote the
formulation and participation in the operation of medical cannabis businesses
by persons from socially and economically disadvantaged communities consistent
with the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and to
coordinate and assist the commission with respect to its incorporation of these
permitting measures into the application and review process for issuing permits
under P.L.2009, c.307 (C.24:6I-1 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The office may review
the commission's measures regarding participation in the medical cannabis
industry by persons from socially and economically disadvantaged communities,
and minority, women's, <u>disability-owned,</u> and disabled veterans'
businesses, and make recommendations on relevant policy and implementation
matters for the improvement thereof.  The office may consult with experts or
other knowledgeable individuals in the public or private sector on any aspect of
its mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The office shall
prepare information regarding its activities pursuant to this section
concerning participation in the medical cannabis industry by persons from
socially and economically disadvantaged communities, including medical cannabis
business development initiatives for minority, women's, <u>disability-owned,</u>
and disabled veterans' businesses participating in the medical cannabis
marketplace, to be incorporated by the commission into its annual report

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 1 of P.L.1986,
c.195 (C.52:27H-21.17) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Historically,
businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with disabilities,</u> and women
have been small establishments offering products and services and their
participation in the nation's business community has been disproportionate to
their numbers in society as a whole.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The opportunity for full
participation in our free enterprise system by  minorities<u>, persons with
disabilities,</u> and women is essential if social and economic justice for
them is to be attained, and the functioning of our economy improved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The role of government
at the national, State and local levels in encouraging the development of
businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with disabilities,</u> and women has
been recognized and is developing at a rapid pace, with technical and financial
assistance, contract procurement, contract set-asides and other programs
designed to encourage development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    As a result, each year
entrepreneurs in New Jersey spend an average of $5,000.00 to demonstrate that
they qualify for these programs designed to foster the growth and development
of their businesses, so that the public agencies administering the programs can
be certain that the businesses which benefit are bona fide minority<u>,
disability-owned,</u> or women's businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A unified procedure for
the certification of businesses owned by minorities<u>, persons with
disabilities,</u> and women, administered by the State, for the purpose of
certifying the eligibility of the businesses for various State programs will
eliminate duplication of effort and improve efficiency, thereby increasing
productivity and reducing costs in the public and the private sectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     &quot;Control&quot;

capital investment, property acquisition, employee hiring, contract
negotiations, legal matters, officer and director selection, operating
