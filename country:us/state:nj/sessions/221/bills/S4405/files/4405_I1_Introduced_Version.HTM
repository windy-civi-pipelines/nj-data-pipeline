STATEMENT This bill requires the New Jersey Transit Corporation (corporation) to issue citations for covered violations as evidenced by recorded images captured by bus obstruction monitoring systems. The bill requires a designated employee of the corporation or a contracted law enforcement agency to review recorded images for covered violations. The corporation is required to install and operate bus obstruction monitoring systems on buses owned and operated by the corporation, or operated under contract with the corporation, to capture recorded images of motor vehicles during the commission of a covered violation and to issue citations for covered violations. The number of buses to be equipped with bus obstruction monitoring systems is to be determined by the corporation. Under the bill, a bus obstruction monitoring system may only be used if it is operated by a bus obstruction monitoring system operator and a sign is affixed to the bus alerting drivers that the bus is equipped with a bus obstruction monitoring system. Under the bill, a bus obstruction monitoring system is to only retain recorded images of motor vehicles that contain evidence of a covered violation.  Recorded images from a bus obstruction monitoring system may be retained for up to six months or 60 days after final disposition of the citation, whichever is later, if the record images contain evidence of a covered violation.  If the recorded images do not contain evidence of a covered violation, the recorded images are required to be destroyed within 15 days after the recorded images were first captured. Recorded images are to be stored on secured servers or encrypted digital storage systems that meet or exceed State information security standards established by the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness. Recorded images are not deemed a government record and are not to be discoverable as a government record by any person, entity, or governmental agency, except upon a subpoena issued by a grand jury or a court order in a criminal matter.  Additionally, recorded images are not permitted to be offered as evidence in any civil or administrative proceeding not directly related to a covered violation.  A bus obstruction monitoring system may not use biometric identification techniques, including facial recognition technology. A bus obstruction monitoring system operator is required to complete training by the manufacturer of the bus obstruction monitoring system in the procedures for setting up, testing, and operating the bus obstruction monitoring system.  Upon completion of the training, the manufacturer is required to issue a signed certificate to the bus obstruction monitoring system operator, which certificate is to be admissible as evidence in any administrative or judicial proceeding for a covered violation.  In addition, a bus obstruction monitoring system operator is required to perform manufacturer-specified functionality tests of each bus obstruction monitoring system prior to the start of daily service and at regular intervals throughout the day, as required by the manufacturer. Each test is to confirm proper operation of the camera, time and date stamp, location tracking, and image capture functions. A bus obstruction monitoring system operator is also required to complete and sign a test verification log for each bus obstruction monitoring system, which log is to meet certain requirements under the bill. Under the bill, no motor vehicle is permitted to stop, stand, or park in a dedicated bus lane, bus stop zone, or designated bicycle lane.  Citations issued by a bus obstruction monitoring system for a covered violation may be contested on certain grounds as provided in the bill. An owner or operator of a motor vehicle who received a citation for a covered violation has 30 days from the date on which the citation was mailed to contest the alleged covered violation. If an owner or operator of a motor vehicle violates the bills provisions, as captured by a bus obstruction monitoring system, the owner or operator of the motor vehicle is subject to a fine of $45 for the first offense. Subsequent offenses within that 12-month period are to increase by $45, with a maximum fine of $135 per offense.  The corporation is permitted to retain any fines collected pursuant to the bill for the purposes of covering administrative costs of administering the bus obstruction monitoring system program.  Any excess revenue from fines collected pursuant to the program is to be used to fund Access Link services. Additionally, the corporation is prohibited from entering into any agreement for bus obstruction monitoring systems or bus obstruction monitoring system operator services that bases contractor compensation on the amount of revenue generated in monetary fines collected. Prior to issuing any citations or fines for covered violations, the corporation is required to issue warning notices for 60 days following the date that active enforcement is implemented.  The corporation is required to issue a public announcement regarding the corporations implementation of the bus obstruction monitoring system and to provide the public with information about the bus obstruction monitoring system on the corporations Internet website contemporaneous with the warning notice period. The bill requires the corporation to submit an annual report to the Governor and to the Legislature regarding the bus obstruction monitoring system, which report is to include certain information. With this bill, the sponsor intends to enhance safety for passengers boarding and alighting from buses particularly at designated bus stops, as well as for pedestrians, cyclists, and micro mobility users who often share curbside and lane space. By keeping bus stops, bus lanes, and adjacent bike lanes clear of obstructing motor vehicles, the bill aims to improve transit reliability, reduce delays, and promote safer and more accessible streets for all users.
