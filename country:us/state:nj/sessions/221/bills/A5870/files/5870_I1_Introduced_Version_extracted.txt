(b)   third-party contractors that provide on-demand micro transit services shall directly employ all on-demand micro transit drivers, who shall not be regarded as independent contractors; and (c)   any contract or agreement between an entity and a third-party contractor, wherein the entity is using public funding to fund the on-demand micro transit program, in whole or in part, includes a precondition that the contractor and all subcontractors of the contractor enter into an agreement with one or more labor organizations which represent or seek to represent the contractors employees, which agreement requires any participating labor organization and its members to agree to refrain from work stoppages, boycotts, or other economic interference against the contractor for the duration of the agreement; b.    on-demand micro transit drivers hold a valid commercial driver license; c.     on-demand micro transit drivers are compensated at no less than the same wages, hours, working conditions, and benefits as other drivers directly employed by a public entity providing on-demand micro transit service; d.    existing employees of the public entity and, if applicable, its existing transportation contractors, and the corporation are not adversely affected by the establishment and operation of the on-demand micro transit program;

and k.    the commissioner, in consultation with the corporation, may establish any other rules, guidelines, or protocols that the commissioner, in consultation with the corporation, deems necessary. 3.    a.  There shall be established in, but not of, the New Jersey Transit Corporation, a Micro Transit Oversight Committee (committee), which shall review each on-demand micro transit plan established by the New Jersey Transit Corporation, a county transit agency, or any other entity and certify that the plan meets all of the requirements of section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    The committee shall be comprised of three members as follows: (1)   a representative from the New Jersey Transit Corporation appointed by the Governor upon recommendation of the executive director of the corporation; (2)   a member of the New Jersey General Assembly appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly; and (3)   a member appointed by the President of the Senate upon recommendation of the labor organization representing the plurality of the employees of the corporation involved in motorbus operations; provided that if at any time during the term of appointment, the member ceases to be affiliated with the labor organization representing a plurality of the relevant segment of employees of the corporation, the labor organization may, thereupon or at any time thereafter during such term, recommend a new member to the President of the Senate for appointment to serve the remainder of the term. Each member shall serve for a term of one year and until the appointment and qualification of a successor.  A majority of the membership of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of committee business, and action may be taken at any meeting by the affirmative vote of a majority of the membership of the committee. c.     The New Jersey Transit Corporation, a county transit agency, or any other entity shall not provide on-demand micro transit service until the entity receives the certification required by this section. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately.

The bill also establishes the Micro Transit Oversight Committee (committee), which is required to review each on-demand micro transit plan established by the corporation, a county transit agency, or any other entity and to certify that the plan meets all of the requirements established under the bill.  The committee is to be comprised of three members:  (1) a representative from the corporation appointed by the Governor upon recommendation of the executive director of the corporation; (2) a member of the New Jersey General Assembly appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly; and (3) a member appointed by the President of the Senate upon recommendation of the labor organization representing the plurality of employees of the corporation involved in motorbus operations.  Each member is to serve a term of one year.
