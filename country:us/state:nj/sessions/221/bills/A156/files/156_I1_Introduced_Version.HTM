concerning seniority and reductions in force in Civil Service and other

<p class=FronterPage style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 6 of P.L.1968,
c.303 (C.34:13A-5.2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    There is hereby
established in the Division of Public Employment Relations a commission to be
known as the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission.  This
commission, in addition to the powers and duties granted by this act, shall
have in the public employment area the same powers and duties granted to the
labor mediation board in sections 7 and 10 of P.L.1941, c.100, and in sections
2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.32.  This commission shall make policy and establish
rules and regulations concerning employer-employee relations in public
employment relating to dispute settlement, grievance procedures and
administration including enforcement of statutory provisions concerning
representative elections and related matters and to implement fully all the
provisions of this act.  <u>The commission shall receive the certification of
an appointing authority and either approve or disapprove the requested
reductions in force in police and fire departments in counties and
municipalities that have not adopted Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New
Jersey Statutes in a manner similar to the procedure established in paragraph
(2) of subsection e. of N.J.S.40A:8-1.</u>  The commission shall consist of
seven members to be appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate.  Of such members, two shall be representative of public
employers, two shall be representative of public employee organizations and
three shall be representative of the public including the appointee who is
designated as chairman.  Of the first appointees, two shall be appointed for
two years, two for a term of three years and three, including the chairman, for
a term of four years.  Their successors shall be appointed for terms of three
years each, and until their successors are appointed and qualified, except that
any person chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired
term of the member whose office has become vacant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the commission,
other than the chairman, shall be compensated at the rate of $250.00 for each
six hour day spent in attendance at meetings and consultations and shall be
reimbursed for necessary expenses in connection with the discharge of their
duties except that no commission member who receives a salary or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>other form of compensation as a
representative of any employer or employee group, organization or association,
shall be compensated by the commission for any deliberations directly involving
members of said employer or employee group, organization or association.
Compensation for more, or less than, six hours per day, shall be prorated in
proportion to the time involved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The chairman of the commission
shall be its chief executive officer and administrator, shall devote his full
time to the performance of his duties as chairman of the Public Employment
Relations Commission and shall receive such compensation as shall be provided
by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.1987, c.456, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    N.J.S.11A:8-1 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11A:8-1. a. A permanent
employee may be laid off for economy, efficiency or other related reason.  A
permanent employee shall receive 45 days' written notice, unless in State
government a greater time period is ordered by the <u>chairperson of the</u>
commission, which shall be served personally or by certified mail, of impending
layoff or demotion and the reasons therefor.  The notice shall expire 120 days
after service unless extended by the <u>chairperson of the</u> commission for
good cause.  At the same time the notice is served, the appointing authority
shall provide the <u>chairperson of the</u> commission with a list of the names
and permanent titles of all employees receiving the notice.  The Civil Service
Commission shall adopt rules to implement employee layoff rights consistent
with the provisions of this section<u>, upon recommendation by the chairperson
of the commission</u>.  The <u>chairperson of the</u> commission shall consult
with the advisory board representing labor organizations prior to such
recommendations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Permanent employees in
the service of the State or a political subdivision shall be laid off in
inverse order of seniority. As used in this subsection, &quot;seniority&quot;
means the length of continuous permanent service in the jurisdiction,
regardless of title held during the period of service, except that for police
and firefighting titles, &quot;seniority&quot; means the length of continuous
permanent service only in the current permanent title and any other title that
has lateral or demotional rights to the current permanent title.  Seniority for
all titles shall be based on the total length of calendar years, months and
days in continuous permanent service regardless of the length of the employee's
work week, work year or part-time status.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For purposes of State
service, a &quot;layoff unit&quot; means a department or autonomous agency and
includes all programs administered by that department or agency.  For purposes
of political subdivision service, the &quot;layoff unit&quot; means a department
in a county or municipality, an entire autonomous agency, or an entire school
district, except that the <u>chairperson of the</u> commission may establish
broader layoff units.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For purposes of State
service, &quot;job location&quot; means a county. The <u>chairperson of the</u>
commission shall assign a job location to every facility and office within a
State department or autonomous agency.  For purposes of local service,
&quot;job location&quot; means the entire political subdivision and includes
any facility operated by the political subdivision outside its geographic
borders.</p>
