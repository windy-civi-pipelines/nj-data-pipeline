WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Designates March 21 each year as Renewable Energy Day in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating March 21 each year as Renewable Energy Day in New Jersey. Whereas, New Jersey is home to a growing renewable energy sector, which has the potential to generate a larger energy supply as the sector develops; and Whereas, In 2023, New Jersey was the nations 12th largest producer of electricity from solar energy, according to the United States Energy Information Administration; and Whereas, By December 2024, New Jersey achieved five gigawatts of installed solar capacity, which was more than double its solar energy output in 2017; and Whereas, The United States Energy Information Administration projects that renewable energy sources will supply 44 percent of electricity in the United States by 2050; and Whereas, On May 23, 2018, Governor Murphy signed into law P.L.2018, c.17, which requires 50 percent of energy sold in the State to come from renewable energy sources by 2030; and Whereas, Expanding the renewable energy sector is an important step toward reducing dependence on declining fossil fuels reserves that pollute our communities and contribute to climate change; and Whereas, A United States Environmental Protection Agency report shows that socially vulnerable populations, including people of color and people with low-incomes, experience a disproportionate negative impact of climate change on their health, jobs, and property; and Whereas, Fostering equitable and affordable access to renewable energy sources can help ensure that all New Jersey residents benefit from renewable energy resources; and Whereas, Increasing the amount of renewable energy produced in the State can improve health outcomes, combat climate change, and increase the resiliency of the States energy supply; and Whereas, Increased demand for renewable energy will require the production of more sophisticated and innovative products and systems, which will create engineering and manufacturing jobs ideally suited to the States highly educated workforce; and Whereas, National Renewable Energy Day is celebrated annually each year on March 21 to promote sustainable energy practices and raise awareness about the critical role of renewable energy in our future; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper for New Jersey to acknowledge the importance of equitable access to renewable energy for the future health and prosperity of all residents in the State by celebrating Renewable Energy Day; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  March 21 of each year is designated as Renewable Energy Day in New Jersey. 2.  The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials, citizens of the State, and other interested groups to observe Renewable Energy Day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates March 21 of each year as Renewable Energy Day in New Jersey. New Jersey is home to a growing renewable energy sector.  In 2023, New Jersey was the nations 12th largest producer of electricity from solar energy according to the United States Energy Information Administration.  By 2024, New Jersey achieved five gigawatts of installed solar capacity, which was more than double its solar energy output in 2017.

Increasing the amount of renewable energy produced in the State can improve health outcomes, combat climate change, and increase the resiliency of the States energy supply.  Increased demand for renewable energy will require the production of more sophisticated and innovative products and systems, which will create engineering and manufacturing jobs ideally suited to the States highly educated workforce.  Due to the impact that the renewable energy sector has on the wealth and health of this State, it is fitting to designate March 21 as Renewable Energy Day in New Jersey.
