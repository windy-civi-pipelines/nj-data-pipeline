AR188 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 188 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 8, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ALEX SAUICKIE District 12 (Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Fantasia and Assemblyman Inganamort SYNOPSIS Urges Governor to declare energy generation emergency in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution urging the Governor to declare an energy generation emergency in the State. Whereas, Energy production is fundamental to the States economic stability and security, and to its citizens quality of life; and Whereas, The Governor is authorized to declare a State of Emergency when a disaster has occurred or may be imminent that requires State aid to alleviate damages or anticipated hardship to localities; and Whereas, The demand for reliable and efficient energy sources is accelerating across the nation, particularly with the rapid growth of data centers, artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, and other economic development projects, which place additional strain on existing energy production and transmission networks; and Whereas, After decades of slow or stagnant load growth, the State faces increasing electricity demands but is unable to accommodate these demands due to its limited power supply; and Whereas, New Jersey has lost over 20 percent of its generating capacity over the last eight years and has gone from a net energy exporter to a net energy importer; and Whereas, This increasing demand and network strain will impose additional costs and hardships on energy users in the State if left unaddressed; and Whereas, The ability to quickly develop and build additive energy infrastructure, including generation and transmission, is critical to the continued economic development of electric resource adequacy of New Jersey; and Whereas, Several other states, along with the federal government, have taken actions to improve energy generation and capacity; and Whereas, These actions include streamlining permitting obligations, expediting review of existing permits, providing emergency waivers for energy generation projects, surveying producers to investigate generation potential, reviewing permitting processes to remove obstacles or impediments, investigating State capacity for energy generation, offering tax credits for low-carbon electricity, offering incentives for low-carbon power sources, and deferring deadlines for clean energy standard compliance; and Whereas, A diversified and affordable supply of energy would create jobs and economic prosperity for New Jersey residents, improve the State trade balance, help the State remain energy competitive, and promote State security; and Whereas, Despite high demand, energy generation has been curtailed by contract terminations and executive orders in New Jersey; and Whereas, While New Jersey energy-generating facilities and electric utilities have a statutory obligation to serve their jurisdictional customers and accommodate future load growth through integrated resource planning, the deterioration of recent energy generation projects and high spikes in energy costs suggest that the Board of Public Utilities has underperformed in understanding, responding to, and meeting the needs of the electric system and large load additions to the system; and Whereas, New Jersey should be ready to meet increasing demands for energy generation and energy independence; and Whereas, It is critical that the Governor declare a State of Emergency in order to foster greater energy production and transmission in the State and to lower energy costs for the consumer; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully urges the Governor to declare an energy generation emergency in the State, and take the necessary steps to prioritize increased energy transmission and generation capacity and lower prices. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Governor, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection, and the commissioners of the Board of Public Utilities. STATEMENT This Assembly Resolution urges the Governor to declare an energy generation emergency in the State and take the necessary steps to prioritize increased energy transmission and generation capacity.  Energy production is fundamental to the States economic stability, security, and its citizens quality of life.  New Jersey has lost over 20 percent of it generating capacity over the last eight years and has gone from a net energy exporter to a net energy importer.  The demand for reliable and efficient energy sources is accelerating across the nation.  New Jersey should be ready to meet increasing demands for energy generation and energy independence.
