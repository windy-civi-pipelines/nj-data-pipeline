The 90-Day Law governs permits generally referred to as waterfront development permits, coastal wetlands permits, Coastal Area Facility Review Act or CAFRA permits, stream encroachment or flood hazard area permits, and treatment works approvals, and sets forth timeframes to be followed by the DEP when processing applications for these permits. Currently, the law provides that the DEP must approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove an application for a construction permit within 90 days following the date that the application is deemed complete.  If the DEP fails to take action on an completed application within 90 days, it will be deemed to have been approved.
