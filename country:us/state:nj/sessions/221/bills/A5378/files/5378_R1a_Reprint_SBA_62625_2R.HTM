<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.2023,
c.197 (C.34:1B-384) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The New Jersey Economic
Development Authority can effectively utilize cultural arts institution
facilities as catalysts for broad economic development in targeted
communities.  Under the legislation, facilities engaged in the cultural,
educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State are provided
with the opportunity to facilitate targeted development, utilizing proceeds
from the sale of State tax credits.  This approach harnesses the ability of
cultural arts institution facilities to attract visitors and businesses to the
State by leveraging the incalculable economic and cultural benefits of building
and supporting world class cultural arts institutions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Projects involving the
development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility are
inherently beneficial to the State because they provide vital contributions to
the communities in which they are located, and together the arts community
provides immeasurable economic and cultural benefits to the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Through a
competitive application process, a cultural arts institution will make its case
for an amount of tax credits necessary for a project to be able to establish
occupancy costs at a competitive level.<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>(Deleted by amendment, P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Legislature declares
that two principal objectives underscore the policy approach of this
legislation: first, that providing spaces for arts and culture to flourish will
result in thriving communities; and second, the State must help to provide
these spaces through an incentives program that better reflects the economics
of arts and culture facilities and that the current suite of real estate
programs cannot succeed in this endeavor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.2)</p>

3 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-385) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in P.L.2023,
c.197 (C.34:1B-383 et al.):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Affiliate&quot; means an
entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or
is controlled by a cultural arts institution.  Control exists in all cases in
which the entity is a member of a controlled group of corporations as defined pursuant
to section 1563 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1563) or the
entity is an organization in a group of organizations under common control that
is subject to the regulations applicable to organizations pursuant to
subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26
U.S.C. s.414).  A cultural arts institution may establish by clear and
convincing evidence, as determined by the authority, that control exists in
situations involving lesser percentages of ownership if the cultural arts
institution shall have control, at a minimum, of all aspects of compliance with
this program.  An affiliate of a cultural arts institution may contribute to
the project cost and may satisfy the requirement for site control during construction
and the eligibility period, but in no event shall the tax credit certificate be
issued to any affiliate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Authority&quot; means
the New Jersey Economic Development Authority established by section 4 of

to 10 percent of the amount of the maximum annual tax credit that the business
is eligible to receive for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the
authority and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the
provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants or other forms
