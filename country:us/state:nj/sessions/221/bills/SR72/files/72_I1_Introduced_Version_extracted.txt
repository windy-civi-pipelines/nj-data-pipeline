A Senate Resolution calling upon the federal government to permit the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infant, and Children benefits to pay for diaper purchases. Whereas, Diapers are critical to the health of infants and toddlers and the economic and emotional health of families; and Whereas, Without enough diapers each day, infants and toddlers are at risk of skin infections, open sores, urinary tract infections, and other conditions that may require medical attention; and Whereas, Many families struggle to meet their diaper needs.  Infants go through 10 to 12 diapers each day, and toddlers go through six to eight diapers each day, costing families an average of $70 to $80 a month; and Whereas, One in three mothers report that at times they do not have enough diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and healthy; and Whereas, This forces many parents to take unsafe measures, with 48 percent of food bank clients who used diapers responding that they delayed changing a diaper to make their supply last longer, and 32 percent tried reusing a disposable diaper; and Whereas, Purchasing diapers also creates an additional economic barrier for working families as most child care providers require parents to provide diapers; and Whereas, Diapers alone can consume six percent of the salary of a full-time working parent earning a minimum wage.  Even if the family receives a child care subsidy, parents may not be able to afford enough diapers to enroll their child, forcing them out of the job market; and Whereas, Meanwhile, there is very little support for families struggling with diaper need.  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) benefits cannot be used for diapers, and if a family receives cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which can be used for the purchase of diapers, the monthly diaper bill can consume up to 40 percent of that assistance in some states; and Whereas, Permitting the use of SNAP and WIC benefits to pay for diaper purchases will reduce diaper need and help to promote better health outcomes for children and better economic outcomes for their families; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.  This House respectfully calls upon the federal government to permit the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infant, and Children benefits to pay for diaper purchases in order to reduce diaper need and help to promote better health outcomes for children and better economic outcomes for their families. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United States, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and every member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation. STATEMENT Diapers are critical to the health of infants and toddlers and the economic and emotional health of families. One in three mothers report that at times they do not have enough diapers to keep their child clean, dry, and healthy.  Without enough diapers each day, infants and toddlers are at risk of skin infections, open sores, urinary tract infections, and other conditions that may require medical attention. Purchasing diapers also creates an additional economic barrier for working families as most child care providers require parents to provide diapers.  Diapers alone can consume six percent of the salary of a full-time working parent earning a minimum wage.  Even if the family receives a child care subsidy, parents may not be able to afford enough diapers to enroll their child, forcing them out of the job market. Many families struggle to meet their diaper needs.  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) benefits cannot be used for diapers.  This resolution calls upon the federal government to permit the use of SNAP and WIC benefits to pay for diaper purchases in order to reduce diaper need and help to promote better health outcomes for children and economic outcomes for their families.
