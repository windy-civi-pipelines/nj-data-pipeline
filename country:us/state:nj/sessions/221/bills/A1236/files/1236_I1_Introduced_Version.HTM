<div class=WordSection3>

<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning access to certain forms of health
care treatment and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the New Jersey Right to Try-Plus Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Patients facing a
terminal illness are frequently willing and anxious to explore a broader range
of experimental, untested, and unconventional treatments, in the hope there may
be options to treat or even cure an otherwise intractable illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    These additional
treatment options may include the use of investigational drugs, biological
products, and devices that have not yet received approval from the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as FDA-approved drugs,
biological products, and devices that have not received FDA approval for use in
treating the patients particular illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The process of securing
FDA approval for investigational drugs, biological products, and devices often
takes many years.  Similarly, it would be prohibitively expensive and
time-consuming to require FDA-approved drugs, biological products, and devices
to complete the full FDA approval process in order to be used in medically
appropriate ways that are not identified on the approved FDA label.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Drugs, biological
products, and devices approved by the FDA may be safely and legally used for &quot;off-label&quot;
purposes, and the off-label use of the products is often necessary to provide
needed care. Approximately 50 percent of cancer patients receive some type of
&quot;off label&quot; drug in their treatment.  The FDA and the federal
Department of Health and Human Services recognize the wide variety of effective
&quot;off-label&quot; uses of FDA-approved drugs. Information on the
appropriate &quot;off-label&quot; use of FDA-approved drugs is obtained from
compendia published by the United States Pharmacopoeial Convention, the
American Medical Association, and the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists.
 In addition, scientific studies of &quot;off-label&quot; use of drugs
published in recognized peer-reviewed professional journals provide information
on appropriate uses of &quot;off-label&quot; drugs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Patients who are
terminally ill do not have the luxury of waiting until an investigational drug,
biological product, or device receives final FDA approval.  In the case of a
public health emergency, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, an illness may be too new for researchers to fully understand the
most effective treatment protocols, and resources may be stretched too thin to
conduct clinical trials within the time left to a patient living with a terminal
illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     All patients, including
patients who are terminally ill, have a right to self-determination in the
course of their medical care, and the right to request non-conventional
treatment options that may save their lives or improve their quality of life
during the last stages of a terminal illness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The off-label use of
FDA-approved drugs, biological products, and devices, and the use of
investigational drugs, biological products, and devices, is a decision that
should be made by the patient in consultation with the patients health care
provider, based on the best information available, and with full awareness of
the potential risks, benefits, and consequences to the patient and the
patients family.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    It is, therefore, the
intent of the Legislature to ensure patients who are terminally ill have access
to treatment options that include the use of investigational drugs, biological
products, and devices, as well as off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs,
biological products, and devices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Investigational drug,
biological product, or device means a drug, biological product, or device that
has successfully completed phase one of a clinical trial approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration, but has not been approved for general use
by the United States Food and Drug Administration and remains under
investigation in a clinical trial approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Terminal illness means a
medical condition that results in a patient's life expectancy being 12 months
or less as determined by a physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a. A manufacturer of an
investigational drug, biological product, or device may make the manufacturers
investigational drug, biological product, or device available to patients
pursuant to this act.  Nothing in this act shall be construed to require a
manufacturer to make an investigational drug, biological product, or device
available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In order to submit a
request for an investigational drug, biological product, or device pursuant to
this section, the patient shall have:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a terminal illness;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish the
New Jersey Right to Try-Plus Act, pursuant to which patients who are
terminally ill would be permitted to request access to investigational drugs,
biological products, and devices that have not yet been approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as well as to off-label treatments
using FDA-approved drugs, biological products, and devices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The sponsor believes that any
person suffering from a terminal illness deserves the right to try any medicine
or other treatment that the person believes may be able to save his or her
life. The sponsor holds that no person or entity should be able to deny a
terminal patient the ability to exercise his or her own judgement on the
matter, with the advice of the patients physician and with the patients
informed consent.  In such a case, no person or entity should be subject to any
legal liability for the patient's decision, except in cases of gross
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To request the use of an
investigational drug, biological product, or device, the patient will be
required to:  have a medical condition that results in a life expectancy of
less than 12 months; have consulted with a physician and considered all other
treatment options currently approved by the FDA; have received a prescription
or recommendation for the investigational drug, biological product, or device
from a physician licensed and in good standing in New Jersey; and give
informed, written consent to use of the investigational drug, biological
product, or device.  The physician authorizing the patient for the
investigational drug, biological product, or device will be required to
document that the patient has met these requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that the
investigational drug, biological product, or device has successfully completed
phase one of an FDA-approved clinical trial and remains under investigation in
an FDA-approved clinical trial.  Nothing in the bill would compel a
manufacturer to make an investigational drug, biological product, or device
available to a patient; however, if the manufacturer chooses to make the drug,
biological product, or device available, the manufacturer will be permitted to
either provide the drug, biological product, or device without compensation or
require the patient pay the costs associated with its manufacture.  Government
medical assistance programs and private health insurers would not be required
to provide coverage for the cost of an investigational drug, biological
product, or device, but private insurers would be permitted to provide coverage
if they so choose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Except in the case of gross
negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct, a physician who assists a

drug, biological product, or device pursuant to the bill will not be liable in
any criminal or civil action or subject to adverse licensure or other
administrative disciplinary action for adverse consequences resulting from acts
or omissions taken by the physician consistent with the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     With regard to off-label uses
of FDA-approved drugs, biological products, and devices, the bill would require
a hospital to provide and administer to a patient, upon request, any
FDA-approved drug, biological product, or device, regardless of whether the
drug, biological product, or device has been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of the patients disease, illness, or condition, and regardless of
whether the drug, biological product, or device is part of the hospitals
treatment protocols for the patients disease, illness, or condition.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A patient will be eligible for
the off-label use of a drug, biological product, or device under the bill if
the patient has:  (1) a medical condition that results in a life expectancy of
less than 12 months; (2) provided a written attestation to having received and
reviewed the patient package insert, medication guide, instructions for use, or
comparable patient-oriented labeling required by the FDA; (3) received a prescription
or recommendation for the drug, biological product, or device from a physician licensed
and in good standing in New Jersey, which physician need not be employed by,
under contract with, or affiliated with the hospital; and (4) given informed,
written consent for the off-label use of the drug, biological product, or
device.  The patient will be required to submit documentation to the hospital
that these requirements are met along with the request for the off-label use of
the drug, biological product, or device.</p>

any physician unaffiliated with the hospital, who assists a patient with a
request for, or who furnishes or administers, a drug, biological product, or
device to a patient for an off-label use pursuant to the bill, will not be
liable in any criminal or civil action or subject to adverse licensure or other
administrative disciplinary action for adverse consequences resulting from acts
or omissions taken by the hospital, health care practitioner, staff member, or
physician consistent with the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any official, employee, or
agent of a State or local government who blocks or attempts to block an
eligible patients access to an investigational or off-label use of a drug,
biological product, or device would be a disorderly person, which offense is
punishable by imprisonment for up to six months, a $1,000 fine, or both.</p>
