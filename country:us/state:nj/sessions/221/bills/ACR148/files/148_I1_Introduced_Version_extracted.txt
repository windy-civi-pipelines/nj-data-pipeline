PETERPAUL District 11 (Monmouth) SYNOPSIS Urges federal government to develop protocols for State and local law enforcement to respond to drones. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging the federal government to develop protocols and mechanisms for State and local law enforcement to respond to unidentified unmanned aircraft systems. Whereas, Between November 20th and 22nd of this year, nighttime incursions by small unmanned aircraft, also known as drones, appeared at several United States military bases in England; and Whereas, Every night since November 18th, the residents of New Jersey have reported sighting small unmanned aircraft over sensitive locations, including Picatinny Arsenal in Morris County, Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County, the States largest reservoir, Round Valley in Hunterdon County, and a residence of the President-elect, Trump National Golf Club in Somerset County; and Whereas, The Federal Aviation Administration relies on State and local law enforcement agencies to observe and report to federal authorities suspicious or unlawful activity in airspace; and Whereas, While the Federal Aviation Administration supports the assistance of interagency partners in assessing ongoing reported sightings, federal aviation statutes limit the ability of State and local governments to independently monitor and enforce drone regulations; and Whereas, The people of New Jersey find that this is not sufficient and have become increasingly alarmed by the surge in drone activity, raising concerns about public safety and security; and Whereas, The situation has highlighted the need for cooperation and information sharing across jurisdictions to facilitate prompt, transparent, and effective responses to drone-related public safety concerns; and Whereas, It is proper and fitting for the people of New Jersey to request that the Federal Aviation Administration develop protocols and mechanisms to guide State and local law enforcement to independently investigate and respond to threats posed by drones; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.  The Legislature of New Jersey respectfully urges the President of the United States, Congress, the Department of Transportation, and the Federal Aviation Administration to develop protocols and mechanisms to guide State and local law enforcement in the investigation and response to threats posed by unidentified unmanned aircraft systems. 2.  Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly and the Secretary of the Senate to the Office of the President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges the President, Congress, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop protocols and mechanisms for State and local law enforcement to investigate and respond to threats posed by unidentified unmanned aircraft, also known as drones. Currently, the Federal Aviation Administration is not authorized to delegate formal enforcement functions to State and local governments.  This resolution requests that the federal government expand the powers of State and local law enforcement to mitigate aerial threats to public safety. New Jersey has recently experienced a surge in sightings of drones.  The drones appear to be larger than any craft a hobbyist would be permitted to own.  These sightings, which have occurred on the heels of similar sightings of drone activity on United States military bases in England, have occurred in several counties and usually happen between dusk and dawn.  Troublingly, many have been spotted over sensitive locations such as military installations, the Round Valley Reservoir, and a residence of the President-elect. It is the sponsors intent to provide the law enforcement professionals of New Jersey with the authority and means to investigate and mitigate threats posed by unidentified drones.
