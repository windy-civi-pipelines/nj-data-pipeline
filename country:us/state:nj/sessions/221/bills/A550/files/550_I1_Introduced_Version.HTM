The Commissioner of Education, with the approval of the State Board of Education, would be responsible for prescribing rules relative to absences for civic events.  This would include, but not be limited to, a list of civic events where it would be mandatory to excuse a pupil.  The bill would not be construed to limit the right of boards of education to excuse absences for civic events not included on the commissioners list.
