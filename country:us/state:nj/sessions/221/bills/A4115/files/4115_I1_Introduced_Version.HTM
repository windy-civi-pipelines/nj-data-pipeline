<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Section 1.  Purpose</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this Compact is
to facilitate interstate practice of audiology and speech-language pathology
with the goal of improving public access to audiology and speech-language
pathology services.  The practice of audiology and speech-language pathology
occurs in the state where the patient, client, or student is located at the
time of the encounter with the patient, client, or student.  This compact
preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and
safety through the current system of state licensure.  This compact is designed
to achieve the following objectives:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Increase public access
to audiology and speech-language pathology services by providing for the mutual
recognition of other member state licenses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Enhance the states
ability to protect the publics health and safety;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Encourage the
cooperation of member states in regulating multistate audiology and
speech-language pathology practice;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Support the spouses of
relocating active duty military personnel;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Enhance the exchange of
licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information between member states;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Allow a remote state to
hold a provider of services with a compact privilege in that state accountable
to that states practice standards; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Allow for the use of
telehealth technology to facilitate increased access to audiology and
speech-language pathology services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Section 2.  Definitions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Adverse action means any
administrative, civil, equitable, or criminal action permitted by a states
laws which is imposed by a licensing board or other authority against an
audiologist or speech-language pathologist, including actions against an
individuals license or privilege to practice such as revocation, suspension,

practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Alternative program means a

pathology licensing board to address impaired practitioners.</p>

board, after an inquiry or investigation that includes notification and an
opportunity for the audiologist or speech-language pathologist to respond, if
required by state law, has reason to believe is not groundless and, if proved

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Data system means a
repository of information about licensees, including, but not limited to,

implement or utilize procedures for considering the criminal history records of
applicants for initial licensure.  Applicants to practice under the compact are
required to maintain licensure in their home state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon application for a
privilege to practice in a remote state, the licensing board in the remote
state will be required to ascertain, through a data system established under
the compact, whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a
license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any
license or privilege to practice held by the applicant, and whether any adverse
action has been taken against any license or privilege to practice held by the
applicant.  Member states may charge a fee for granting a compact privilege.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order for an audiologist to
practice under the compact, the audiologist will be required to meet certain
educational requirements; have completed a supervised clinical practicum
experience and successfully passed a national examination approved by the
Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology Compact Commission  (commission); hold
an active, unencumbered license; have not been convicted or found guilty of a
felony related to the practice of audiology; and have a valid United States
Social Security or National Practitioner Identification number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order for a speech-language
pathologist to practice under the compact, the speech-language pathologist will
be required to meet certain educational requirements; have completed a
supervised clinical practicum experience; have completed a supervised
postgraduate professional experience; have successfully passed a national
examination approved by the commission; hold an active, unencumbered license;
have not been convicted or found guilty of a felony related to the practice of
speech-language pathology; and have a valid United States Social Security or
National Practitioner Identification number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An audiologist or
speech-language pathologist practicing in a member state will be required to
comply with the practice laws of the state in which the client is located at
the time service is provided.  The practice of audiology and speech-language
pathology will include all audiology and speech-language pathology practice as
defined by the state practice laws of the member state in which the client is
located.  The practice of audiology and speech-language pathology in a member
state under a privilege to practice will subject an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the
courts, and the laws of the member state in which the client is located at the
time service is provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Individuals not residing in a
member state will continue to be able to apply for a member states
single-state license as provided under the laws of that member state; provided
that a single-state license granted to a non-resident will not be recognized as
authorizing the licensee to practice in other remote states under the compact;
an individual residing in a non-member state will only be authorized to
practice in the specific states in which the individual is licensed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To exercise the compact
privilege under the terms and provisions of the compact, an audiologist or
speech-language pathologist will be required to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    hold an active license
in the home state;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    have no encumbrance on
any state license;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    be eligible for a
compact privilege;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    have not had any adverse
action against any license or compact privilege within the previous two years
from the date of the application;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5)    notify the commission
that the licensee is seeking the compact privilege within a remote state;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    pay any applicable fees,
including any state fee, for the compact privilege; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7)    report to the commission
any adverse action taken against the licensee by any non-member state within 30
days from the date the adverse action is taken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Licensees who move from one
member state to another member state will be required to obtain home-state
licensure in the new member state in order to continue practicing under the
compact.  The licensee will also be required to terminate licensure in the
former home state. Licensees moving to another member state will be permitted
to initiate the licensure application process in the new member state before
moving to the new member state.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a licensee moves from a
member state to a non-member state, the licensee will no longer be able to
participate in the compact, but may practice in member states by obtaining a
single-state license to practice in the state, and may continue to practice in
the former home state, if the licensee maintains licensure in that state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Licensees providing audiology
or speech-language pathology services in a remote state under the compact
privilege will be required to function within the laws and regulations of the
remote state, and will be subject to that states regulatory authority.  A
remote state may, in accordance with due process and that states laws, remove
a licensees compact privilege in the remote state for a specific period of
time, impose fines, and take any other necessary actions to protect the health
and safety of its citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a home state license is
encumbered, the licensee will lose the compact privilege in any remote state
until:  1) the home state license is no longer encumbered; 2) two years have
elapsed from the date of the adverse action; and 3) the licensee otherwise
meets the requirements to practice under the compact.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Member states will be required
to recognize the right of an audiologist or speech-language pathologist to
practice audiology or speech-language pathology under the compact in any member
state via telehealth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Active duty military personnel
and their spouses will be permitted to practice under the compact by
designating a home state where the individual has a current license in good
standing.  The individual may retain the home state designation during the
period the service member is on active duty.  Subsequent to designating a home
state, the individual may only change the individuals home state through
application for licensure in the new state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Only a home state may take
adverse action against a licensees license.  However, remote states will have
the authority to take adverse action against an audiologists or
speech-language pathologists privilege to practice within that member state
and issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations.  Home states will be
required to give the same priority and effect to reported conduct received from
a member state as they would if the conduct had occurred within the home
state.  In so doing, the home state is to apply its own state laws to determine
appropriate action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A member state may take
adverse action against an audiologist or speech-language pathologist based on
the factual findings of a remote state, provided that the member state follows
the member state's own procedures for taking the adverse action.  Member states
may participate in investigations and share information with other member
states in furtherance of an investigation.  Home states will be required to
complete any pending investigations of an audiologist or speech-language
pathologist who changes primary state of residence during the course of an
investigation.  The home state will also have the authority to take appropriate
action against the licensee and will be required to promptly report the
conclusions of the investigation to the data system established under the
compact, which will then notify the new home state of any adverse actions
against the licensee.  Member states may recover from a licensee the costs of
investigations and dispositions of cases resulting from any adverse action
taken against the licensee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in the compact is to
override a member states decision that participation in an alternative program
may be used in lieu of adverse action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact is administered by
a joint public agency known as the Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology
Compact Commission.  Each member state appoints two delegates to the
commission, including one audiologist and one speech-language pathologist,
which members are selected by the member states licensing board.  The
delegates are required to be current members of the member states licensing
board.  The commission also includes five additional delegates, each of whom is
either a public member or board administrator from a state licensing board, who
are chosen by the commissions executive committee from a pool of nominees provided
by the commission at large.  The commission meets at least once during each
calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is responsible
for:  establishing its fiscal year; establishing bylaws; establishing a code of
ethics; maintaining financial records; meeting and taking actions consistent
with the compact and the commissions bylaws; promulgating uniform rules to
facilitate and coordinate the implementation and administration of the compact;
bringing and prosecuting legal proceedings or actions; purchasing and maintaining
insurance and bonds; engaging personnel services and establishing personnel
policies and programs; accepting any and all appropriate donations and grants
of money, equipment, supplies, materials, services, and property, provided that
at all times the commission avoids any appearance of impropriety or conflict of
interest; establishing a budget and making expenditures; borrowing money;
appointing committees; providing and receiving information from, and
cooperating with, law enforcement agencies; establishing and electing an
executive committee; and performing other functions as may be necessary or
appropriate to achieve the purposes of the compact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissions executive
committee comprises 10 members, including seven voting members who are elected
by the commission from its current membership and three nonvoting, ex-officio
members, including one member from a recognized national audiology professional
association, one member from a recognized national speech-language pathology
association, and one member from the recognized membership organization of the
audiology and speech-language pathology licensing boards.  The ex-officio
members will be selected by their respective organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The executive committee meets
at least annually, and has the following duties and responsibilities: 
recommending to the entire commission changes to its rules or bylaws, changes
to the compact, fees paid by compact member states, and fees charged to
licensees; ensuring compact administration services are appropriately provided;
preparing and recommending the commissions budget; maintaining financial
records; monitoring compliance with the compact by member states; establishing
additional committees as necessary; and any other duties as provided in the
commissions rules or bylaws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All meetings of the commission
are to be open to the public and are subject to public notice requirements. 
However, the commission, its executive committee, and other committees may
convene in a closed, non-public meeting if the commission or executive
committee or other committees of the commission are to discuss: non-compliance
of a member state with the compact; personnel issues related to specific
employees or other matters related to the commissions internal personnel
practices and procedures; current, threatened, or reasonably anticipated
litigation; negotiation of purchase contracts; criminal accusations and formal
censures; disclosure of trade secrets or privileged or confidential
information; disclosure of private, personal information; disclosure of
investigative records compiled for law enforcement purposes; disclosure of
information related to investigative reports; or other matters specifically
exempted from disclosure by state or federal law.  If a meeting, or portion of a
meeting, is closed, the commissions legal counsel or designee is required to
certify that the meeting may be closed and reference each relevant exempting
provision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is required to
pay, or provide for the payment of, the reasonable expenses of its
establishment, organization, and ongoing activities.  The commission may accept
any and all appropriate revenue sources, donations, and grants of money,
equipment, supplies, materials, and services.  The commission may levy on and
collect an annual assessment from each member state or impose fees on other
parties to cover the cost of its operations and activities.  The commission may
not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet
the same; nor may it pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by
and with the authority of the member state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is required to
keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and
disbursements of the commission are subject to audit and accounting procedures,
and all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission are to be
audited yearly, with the report of the audit included in the commissions
annual report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members, officers,
executive director, employees, and representatives of the commission are immune
from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for
any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil
liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or
omission within the scope of commission employment, duties, or
responsibilities.  The commission is required to defend its members, officers,
executive director, employees, and representatives in any civil action arising
out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that
nothing in the compact prohibits any person from retaining the persons own
counsel.  The commission is required to indemnify and hold harmless any member,
officer, executive director, employee, or representative of the commission for
the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising
out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the
scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities.  The immunity,
requirement to defend, and requirement to indemnify under the compact do not
apply to intentional or willful or wanton misconduct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is required to
provide for the development, maintenance, and utilization of a coordinated
database and reporting system containing licensure, adverse action, and
investigative information on all licensed individuals in member states.  Member
states are required to submit a uniform data set to the data system on all
individuals to whom the compact is applicable, including:  identifying
information; licensure data; adverse actions against a license or compact
privilege; non-confidential information related to alternative program participation;
any denial of an application for licensure, and the reason for the denial; and
other information that may facilitate the administration of the compact. 
Investigative information pertaining to a licensee is only available to other
member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is required to
promptly notify all member states of any adverse action taken against a
licensee or an individual applying for a license.  Adverse action information
pertaining to a licensee in any member state is available to any other member
state.  Member states contributing information to the data system may designate
information that may not be shared with the public without that states express
permission.  Any information submitted to the data system that is subsequently
required to be expunged by the laws of the member state contributing the
information is to be removed from the data system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission is required to
promulgate rules to administer the compact, which rules are binding on all
member states.  If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects
a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to
adopt the compact within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, the
rule will have no further force and effect in any member state.  Rules may be
adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.  Proposed
rulemakings are subject to a 30-day public notice requirement.  The rulemaking
process includes a process for the public to submit written data, facts,
opinions, and arguments, which are made available to the public.  The
commission may also be required to hold a public hearing on the proposed
rulemaking upon request by at least 25 individuals, by a governmental entity,
or by an organization that has at least 25 members.  All public hearings are
recorded and made available on request.  More than one proposed rule may be
considered at a single hearing.  In adopting final rules, the commission is
required to consider all written and oral comments received.  The commission
additionally has the authority to adopt emergency rules under certain
circumstances, which emergency rules are valid for no more than 90 days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon request by a member
state, the commission is to attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact
that arise among member states and between member and non-member states, which
may include mediation or binding dispute resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Member states may withdraw
from the compact by enacting a repealer statute.  A member states withdrawal
will not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing
statute.  Withdrawal does not affect the requirement for the withdrawing state
to continue to assist with investigative and adverse action reporting
requirements incurred prior to withdrawal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in the compact is to
be construed to invalidate or prevent any audiology or speech-language
pathology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member
state and a non-member state that does not conflict with the provisions of the
compact.  The compact may be amended by the member states, through the adoption
of amendatory legislation in each member state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact is to be liberally
construed so as to effectuate its purposes.  The provisions of the compact are
severable.  Nothing in the compact is to be construed to prevent the
enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with
the compact.  All laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are
superseded to the extent of the conflict.  All lawful actions of the commission,
including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the commission, are binding upon
the member states. All agreements between the commission and the member states
are binding in accordance with their terms.  In the event any provision of the
compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any
member state, the provision is ineffective to the extent of the conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact took effect upon
adoption by 10 states, and is currently in effect in 23 states, including
Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and
Wyoming. </p>
