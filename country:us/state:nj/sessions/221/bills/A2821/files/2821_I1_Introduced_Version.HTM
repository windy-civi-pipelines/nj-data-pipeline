by the contracting agent for the provision or performance of any goods or
services, the cost of which in the aggregate exceeds the bid threshold, shall
be awarded only by resolution of the governing body of the contracting unit to
the lowest responsible bidder after public advertising for bids and bidding
therefor, except as is provided otherwise in this act or specifically by any
other law. The governing body of a contracting unit may, by resolution approved
by a majority of the governing body and subject to subsections b. and c. of
this section, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the
lowest responsible bidder, if the governing body finds that it has had prior
negative experience with the bidder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As used in this section,
&quot;prior negative experience&quot; means any of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the bidder has been
found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other
contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have:
failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the
contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a
prior contract with the contracting unit;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the bidder defaulted on
a contract, thereby requiring the local unit to utilize the services of another
contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or
complete the contract;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the bidder defaulted on
a contract, thereby requiring the local unit to look to the bidder's surety for
completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the bidder is debarred
or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the
executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award,
whether or not the action was based on experience with the contracting unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The following

disqualification based on prior negative experience:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The existence of any of
the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not
require that a bidder be disqualified.  In each instance, the decision to
disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the governing body and shall
be rendered in the best interests of the contracting unit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   All mitigating factors
shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative
experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The bidder shall be
furnished by the governing body with a written notice (a) stating that a
disqualification is being considered; (b) setting forth the reason for the
disqualification; and (c) indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an
opportunity for a hearing before the governing body if the bidder so requests
within a stated period of time.  At the hearing, the bidder shall show good
cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and
testimony.  If the governing body determines that good cause has not been shown
by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and,
thus, disqualified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Disqualification shall
be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A disqualification,
other than a disqualification pursuant to which a governing body is prohibited
by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period
thereof may be reduced, in the discretion of the governing body, upon the
submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary
evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of
relief, such as reversal of a judgment, or actual change of ownership,
management or control of the bidder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An opportunity for a
hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its
suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of
the State of New Jersey.  The term of such a disqualification shall be
concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or
department.</p>
