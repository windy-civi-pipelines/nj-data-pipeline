<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated the
Equitable Disclosure Act of 2010 applies the same rules for objectors and
applicants in the land use approval and appeals process. The goal is to make
sure land use boards and other boards of jurisdictions receive full disclosure
of applicants and objectors. Due process rights are fully maintained under this
bill. Disclosure requirements are applied to objectors and applicants on a
level playing field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The proposed legislation
applies current case law and court rules for the disclosure of all interests
before a land use board or court. The legislation addresses coordinated efforts
to delay approvals that are oftentimes undertaken by economic competitors and
are at times clandestine. The Wall Street Journal reports how these covert
operations are proudly referred to as black arts by the groups undertaking
them. (Rival Chains Secretly Fund Opposition to Walmart, The Wall Street
Journal, June 7, 2010.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The approval and appeal
process outline in the &quot;Municipal Land Use Law&quot; (MLUL), P.L.1975,
c.291 (C40:55D-1 et seq.) has become a tool for economic competitors of land
use applicants. The tactic is to delay final approval of projects at the
expense of taxpayers, businesses, and developers.  Economic competitors who
have no legitimate land use based objections to an application are manipulating
the MLUL with a strategy of delay and deception. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill does not limit
anyones rights, including economic competitors, with legitimate, land-use
based objections from appearing and testifying. The bill contains the following
components:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Clarifies the definition
of interested party in the MLUL to exclude economic competition as the sole
reason for standing while at the same time protects economic competitors
standing as a party immediately concerned and gives them an opportunity to
make their case as to how the approval would negatively impact their position
on land use grounds (language modeled after case law);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Adds transparency and
fairness by applying disclosure requirements to objectors similar to the
ownership disclosure requirements for the applicant.  They include providing:
name and address, employer, affiliation with an economic competitor, who is
paying for professional fees if any, and a statement on how the right to use,
acquire, or enjoy property is affected;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Empowers court, in its
discretion, to award attorneys fees that were paid with public funds should an
approval be upheld on appeal;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Empowers court, in its
discretion, to award applicants attorneys fees should the case be deemed to
be frivolous (language modeled from court rules);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Empowers court, at its
discretion, to order appellant to post security (modeled after court rules);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Provides planning or
zoning board with continuing jurisdiction over an application notwithstanding
an appeal unless a stay has been issued by the reviewing court;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Requires participation
in public hearing process in order to have standing to appeal to courts.</p>
