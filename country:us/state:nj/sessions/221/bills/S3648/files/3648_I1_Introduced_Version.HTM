delivering a voted mail-in ballot by mail or in person as provided under
&quot;The Vote By Mail Law,&quot; P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.), a mail-in
voter shall be entitled to deposit the voter's completed mail-in ballot in a
ballot drop box established by the county board of elections as provided under
this section.  Each mail-in ballot deposited in a ballot drop box by the time
designated under current law for the closing of the polls for that election
shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed.  If, at the closing of the
polls, a voter deposits a mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box in a county in
which the voter does not reside, the county board of elections, upon
discovering that fact, shall notify and timely deliver the ballot to the county
board of elections of the county in which the voter resides, who shall accept

the election.  The ballot drop boxes shall be located throughout the county in
a manner specified under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The county board of
elections may establish a pickup schedule to retrieve mail-in ballots deposited
in ballot drop boxes, consistent with the guidelines established by the

campus of each State college or university; and the main campus of each
independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000
students.  Notwithstanding the locational criteria established by this
subparagraph, whenever two or more ballot drop box locations are separated by a
distance of less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections in each county shall
determine secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes in compliance with
the requirements of this section.  The secondary ballot drop box locations
shall be located within the municipality where those ballot drop boxes were
originally located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the members of
the board of elections.  However, in the event of a tie in the votes cast by
the members of the board of elections, the county clerk shall cast the deciding
vote.  Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box shall be located in a

the voters of each county in compliance with the guidelines adopted pursuant to
subsection c. of this section.  The Secretary of State shall establish
guidelines for the placement of the ballot drop boxes, the security of the
ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot pickup from the ballot boxes.</p>
