Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved to each such category, in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year. The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved for each such category, but not subject to redemption or transfer.

If the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall  have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. f.     A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are less than $2,500; a review of the qualified wages for the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages; and a review of the qualified wages for 35 randomly selected employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with qualified wages other than the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses shall be adjusted based on any discrepancies identified for the reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items and qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses also shall be adjusted based on the projection of any discrepancies identified based on the review of randomly selected expense items or wages pursuant to this subsection to the extent that the discrepancies exceed one percent of the total reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items, or qualified wages.  The determination shall be provided in writing to the taxpayer, and a copy of the written determination shall be included in the filing of a return that includes a claim for a tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. g.    A taxpayer shall withhold from each payment to a loan out company, to an independent contractor, or to a homeowner for the use of a personal residence an amount equal to 6.37 percent of the payment otherwise due.  The amounts withheld shall be deemed to be withholding of liability pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., and the taxpayer shall be deemed to have the rights, duties, and responsibilities of an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes.  The director shall allocate the amounts withheld for a taxable year to the accounts of the individuals who are employees of a loan out company in proportion to the employee's payment by the loan out company in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during the taxable year.  A loan out company that reports its payments to employees in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during a taxable year shall be relieved of its duties and responsibilities as an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes for the taxable year for any payments relating to the payments on which the taxpayer withheld.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content production expenses shall include any payments made by the taxpayer to a loan out company for services performed in New Jersey by individuals who are employees of the loan out company and whose wages and salaries are subject to withholding, but not subject to tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to the provisions of a reciprocity agreement with another state.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union on behalf of an individual that performed services on a production that tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. was not withheld shall constitute qualified film production expenses, provided that the payment otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section. h.    As used in this section: "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.

The amount of the tax credit applied under this section against the tax otherwise due under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., for a taxable year, when taken together with any other payments, credits, deductions, and adjustments allowed by law shall not reduce the tax liability of the taxpayer to an amount less than zero.  The amount of the tax credit otherwise allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the taxable year due to the limitations of this subsection or under other provisions of N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., may be carried forward, if necessary, to the seven taxable years following the taxable year for which the tax credit was allowed. d. (1) A business entity that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes shall not be allowed a tax credit pursuant to this section directly, but the amount of tax credit of a taxpayer in respect of a distributive share of entity income, shall be determined by allocating to the taxpayer that proportion of the tax credit acquired by the entity that is equal to the taxpayer's share, whether or not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the entity for its taxable year ending within or with the taxpayer's taxable year.

A business entity that is not a gross income "taxpayer" as defined and used in the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., and therefore is not directly allowed a credit under this section, but otherwise meets all the other requirements of this section, shall be considered an eligible applicant and "taxpayer" as that term is used in this section, and the application of an otherwise allowed credit amount shall be distributed to appropriate gross income taxpayers pursuant to the other requirements of this subsection. e.     (1) A taxpayer, with an application for a tax credit provided for in subsection a. or subsection b. of this section, may apply to the authority and the director for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of the taxpayer being allowed any amount of the tax credit against the tax liability of the taxpayer.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the taxpayer from the authority and the director, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, to any other taxpayer that may have a tax liability under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., [or] the "Corporation Business Tax Act (1945)," P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54A:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5, in exchange for private financial assistance to be provided by the purchaser or assignee to the taxpayer that has applied for and been granted the tax credit. The tax credit transfer certificate provided to the taxpayer shall include a statement waiving the taxpayer's right to claim that amount of the tax credit against the tax imposed pursuant to N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. that the taxpayer has elected to sell or assign.  The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the taxpayer of less than 75 percent of the transferred tax credit amount.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability under N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of a tax credit pursuant to subsections c. and d. of this section.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate obtained by a purchaser or assignee under subsection e. of this section may be applied against the purchaser's or assignee's tax liability under P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) [and] , P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54A:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of a credit pursuant to subsection c. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b). (2)   A taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate, may first use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in any tax period after the tax period for which it was issued, up to and including the next three successive tax periods after receipt by the purchaser, without the need to amend the return for the year for which the credit was issued. f. (1) The value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved by the director and the authority pursuant to subsection a. of this section and pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), and except as provided in section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), to taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, shall not exceed a cumulative total of $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2019 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year [2040] 2050 to apply against the tax imposed pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., and pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  In addition to the limitation on the value of tax credits approved by the director for New Jersey film-lease production companies and the limitation on the value of tax credits approved by the director for other taxpayers imposed by this paragraph, and except as provided in section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), the value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved by the director and the authority pursuant to subsection a. of this section and pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) to New Jersey studio partners shall not exceed a cumulative total of $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2021 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year 2024, and shall not exceed a cumulative total of $150,000,000 in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year [2040] 2026, and shall not exceed a cumulative total of $300,000,000 in fiscal year 2026 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year 2050, to apply against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and the tax imposed pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  Beginning in fiscal year [2023] 2026, in addition to the cumulative total tax credits made available for New Jersey studio partners pursuant to this paragraph and subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), up to an additional [$400,000,000] $250,000,000 may be made available annually, in the discretion of the authority, to New Jersey studio partners for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). In addition to the limitation on the value of tax credits approved by the director for New Jersey studio partners and the limitation on the value of tax credits approved by the director for other taxpayers imposed by this paragraph, and except as provided in section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), the value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved by the director and the authority pursuant to subsection a. of this section and pursuant to subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) to New Jersey film-lease production companies shall not exceed a cumulative total of $100,000,000 in fiscal year 2021 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year 2024, and shall not exceed a cumulative total of $150,000,000 in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year 2040, to apply against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and the tax imposed pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  Beginning in fiscal year 2023, in addition to the cumulative total tax credits made available for New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph and subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), up to an additional $250,000,000 may be made available annually, in the discretion of the authority, to New Jersey film-lease production companies for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362).  Approvals made to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies shall be subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, recapture, forfeiture, and termination, except that in the event of a recapture of tax credits, the tax credits shall only be recaptured from the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law to the contrary, if a film production company designated as a New Jersey studio partner ceases to qualify for its designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey film-lease production companies in each fiscal year by a corresponding amount pursuant to a formula established in rules adopted by the authority which shall consider the volume of applications submitted by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, the cumulative total amount of tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities in the prior fiscal year, the total square footage of facility space occupied in the State by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, and any other factors that the authority deems appropriate.  Award agreements between the authority and New Jersey studio partners shall include a requirement for each New Jersey studio partner to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period.  If a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey studio partner, except for the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner, the authority [shall] may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall [terminate] be reduced to eliminate the portion of the tax credits only available by virtue of such designation.  Notwithstanding any law, regulation, or rule to the contrary, in the event of a recapture of tax credits, the tax credits shall only be recaptured from the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  The authority shall establish a non-binding, administrative pre-certification process for potentially eligible projects. If the cumulative total amount of tax credits, and tax credit transfer certificates, allowed to taxpayers for taxable years or privilege periods commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that fiscal year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved to each such category in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, or taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved for each such category, but not subject to redemption or transfer. (2)   The value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved by the authority and the director pursuant to subsection b. of this section and pursuant to subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) shall not exceed a cumulative total of $30,000,000 in fiscal year 2019 and in each fiscal year thereafter prior to fiscal year [2040] 2050 to apply against the tax imposed pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. and the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). If the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for taxable years or privilege periods commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are less than $2,500; a review of the qualified wages for the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages; and a review of the qualified wages for 35 randomly selected employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with qualified wages other than the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses shall be adjusted based on any discrepancies identified for the reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items and qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses also shall be adjusted based on the projection of any discrepancies identified based on the review of randomly selected expense items or wages pursuant to this subsection to the extent that the discrepancies exceed one percent of the total reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items, or qualified wages.  The determination shall be provided in writing to the taxpayer, and a copy of the written determination shall be included in the filing of a return that includes a claim for a tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. h.    A taxpayer shall withhold from each payment to a loan out company, to an independent contractor, or to a homeowner for the use of a personal residence an amount equal to 6.37 percent of the payment otherwise due.  The amounts withheld shall be deemed to be withholding of liability pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., and the taxpayer shall be deemed to have the rights, duties, and responsibilities of an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes.  The director shall allocate the amounts withheld for a taxable year to the accounts of the individuals who are employees of a loan out company in proportion to the employee's payment by the loan out company in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during the taxable year.  A loan out company that reports its payments to employees in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during a taxable year shall be relieved of its duties and responsibilities as an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes for the taxable year for any payments relating to the payments on which the taxpayer withheld.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content production expenses shall include any payments made by the taxpayer to a loan out company for services performed in New Jersey by individuals who are employees of the loan out company and whose wages and salaries are subject to withholding, but not subject to tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to the provisions of a reciprocity agreement with another state.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union on behalf of an individual that performed services on a production that tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. was not withheld shall constitute qualified film production expenses, provided that the payment otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section. i.     As used in this section: "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. "Business assistance or incentive" means "business assistance or incentive" as that term is defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2007, c.101 (C.54:50-39).

(cf: P.L.2025, c.2, s.9) 5.    (New section) a. A taxpayer that is a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company, upon approval of an application submitted pursuant to P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b et al.) by the authority and the director, shall be allowed an additional tax credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during a tax period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049, provided that: (1)   the application is accompanied by a plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey, which plan shall include at least two of the following criteria: (a)   the creation of a video at least three minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, a taxpayer shall provide a list of locations in New Jersey used for the film and relevant footage for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (b)   the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at publicly accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State. The social media posts shall originate from an official account of the taxpayer or the film, or as otherwise permitted by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, the taxpayer shall provide the Internet website on which the post is publicly visible for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (c)   the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl and after contractual credit placement obligations; (d)   the film is set, at least in part, in New Jersey, and the State is referenced in the film; (e)   support for a workforce development program established by a college, including a community college, an apprentice program, or a university in this State, which program includes direct training or employment opportunities on the film for residents of this State; (f)   a film industry recruiting program established by the taxpayer providing paid internships or entry level employment opportunities in film crew positions for State residents of an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality as that term is defined in section 55 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323), or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; (g)   the taxpayer engages at least five vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey that employ at least one full-time employee at a physical location in an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality as that term is defined in section 55 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323), or on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; and (h)   any alternative criteria as the authority shall provide pursuant to subsection c. of this section; and (2)   the director and the authority have verified that the taxpayer met the goals outlined in the plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Unless the taxpayer a film that is eligible for an additional tax credit for a television series that relocated to New Jersey, pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) or paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), in addition to the credit provided pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a taxpayer that is a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company, upon approval of an application submitted pursuant to P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b et al.) by the authority and the director, shall be allowed an additional tax credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during a tax period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049, provided that the taxpayers plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey includes a total of at least four of the criteria in paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section. c.     The authority shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this section, including, at a minimum, alternative promotional criteria, approved social media platforms, and requirements for a vendors physical location. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to applications submitted after the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of the film and digital media content production tax credit program (program) administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Among other changes, the bill extends the programs availability until July 2049, ten years longer than it is available under current law. Increased Tax Credit Awards This bill increases the amount of tax credits that may be awarded to a New Jersey studio partner under the program, from 35 percent to 40 percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses during a tax period, when the expenses are incurred for services performed and tangible personal property purchased for use at a sound stage or other location within the State and within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York. Incentive to Relocate Television Series to New Jersey This bill provides that a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is eligible for an additional tax credit in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses incurred during a taxable period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049 for a film that is a television series that relocated to New Jersey.  The bill defines television series that relocated to New Jersey to mean a scripted television series of at least six episodes, with an average production budget of $2.5 million per episode, and for which all prior seasons of the series were filmed outside New Jersey. New Jersey Film-Lease Post-Production Company The bill defines a New Jersey film-lease post-production company to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of combined group or any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of the program, has made a commitment to lease or otherwise occupy production space in a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and satisfies certain criteria set forth in the bill. If a New Jersey film-lease partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company is required to have entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of satisfying certain provisions in the bill, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for post-production, including visual effects activities that are performed by the New Jersey film-lease post-production company or by a business entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has an ownership interest of at least 50 percent. Qualified Post-Production Company The bill replaces the definition of independent post-production company with a definition of qualified post-production company and replaces the former term with the latter throughout the bill.  Under the bill, "qualified post-production company" means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity engaged in post-production, including visual effects activities on a film or films described in this section, including, but not limited to, a film or films that do not satisfy certain requirements under the bill. Under the program, a taxpayers expenses for visual effects services performed by a qualified post-production company may include qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for post-production, including visual effects activities performed by a business entity in which the qualified post-production company has an ownership interest of at least 51 percent. Application and Carry Forward of Credit The bill provides that a taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate, may use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in any tax period after the tax period for which it was issued, up to and including the next three successive tax periods after receipt by the purchaser, without the need to amend the return for the year for which the credit was issued. Maximum Credit Availability Under current law, in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter until the conclusion of the program, the cumulative total awards are limited to $150 million for New Jersey studio partners.  However, the authority may, in its discretion, award an additional $400 million to New Jersey studio partners. This bill amends current law so that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, the maximum cumulative total awards is increased to $300 million for New Jersey studio partners.  In addition, the bill decreases the additional discretionary awards to $250 million for New Jersey studio partners beginning in fiscal year 2026. Recapture of Tax Credits Under current law, the approval of tax credits for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies is subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, the recapture of tax credits.  The bill provides that the recapture of tax credits may only apply to the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. Current law also provides that if a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period, the authority is required to recapture certain portions of the tax credit.  This bill instead authorizes the authority to recapture certain portions of the tax credit in these instances.  However, the bill also provides an exception to this recapture provision in any circumstance in which the New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner.  The bill includes similar exceptions for failure to occupy the required space for a New Jersey film-lease production or New Jersey film-lease post-production company. Deferred Compensation Under current law, a New Jersey studio partner that makes certain deferred compensation payments is permitted to file a supplemental report no later than two years after the date on which the production concludes.  This bill modifies current law to permit the submission of a supplemental report no later than four years after the date on which the production concludes. Additionally, the bill permits a New Jersey studio partner to include deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, including those payments for which tax was not withheld under the gross income tax, within qualified film production expenses, provided that the payments otherwise satisfy the requirements of the program. Current law permits a New Jersey studio partner that incurs $25 million or more in qualified film production expenses in the State to include within qualified film production expenses, in excess of amounts paid to highly compensated individuals, up to $72 million of certain wages or salaries.  This bill additionally permits a New Jersey studio partner that incurs $125 million or more in qualified film production expenses in the State for the production of a feature film to include within qualified film production expenses, in excess of the amounts paid to highly compensated individuals, amounts paid for scripts, and amounts paid or incurred for deferred compensation, to include up to $72 million of certain wages and salaries. Expansion of Transferred Tax Credit Applicability Under current law, tax credits awarded under the program may be applied against a taxpayers liability under the gross income tax or corporation business tax.  In addition, this bill authorizes the application of transferred credits against a taxpayers liability for an insurance premium tax. Credit for Diversity Plan Under current law, a taxpayer who is eligible for tax credits under the program may receive an additional credit in an amount equal to two percent of the qualified film production expenses or four percent of the digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer during a tax period if: (1) the application is accompanied by a diversity plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring minority persons and women; (2) the director and the authority have approved the plan as meeting the requirements established by the director and the authority; and (3) the director and the authority have verified that the applicant has met or made good faith efforts in achieving those goals. Current law provides that a tax credit for four percent of qualified film production expenses may be available to a taxpayer, rather than two percent, if the diversity plan includes specific goals that include hiring persons as performers in the film who are: (1) women or members of a minority group; (2) residents of New Jersey for at least 12 months preceding the beginning of filming or recording; and (3) members of a bona fide labor union representing film and television performers. This bill removes the additional requirements necessary for a taxpayer to receive a four percent tax credit, rather than two percent, and increases the bonus credit for all eligible applicants.  Under the bill, a taxpayer may earn a credit equal to four and one-half percent of qualified film production expenses for a diversity plan meeting the same criteria required for a credit equal to four percent of digital media content production expenses. In addition, this bill requires, instead of a diversity plan for hiring minority persons, and women, that an application for this additional credit be accompanied by a plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring residents of an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality, or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005. New Jersey Promotion and Support Credit In addition to the amount of tax credits otherwise allowed under the program, the bill allows an additional promotional tax credit for certain film productions in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of a taxpayers qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses under certain conditions. Specifically, a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film lease production company may qualify for this additional credit by submitting, alongside an application to the authority and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury (director), a plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey.  Under the bill, a taxpayer is required to include at least two promotional criteria in the plan, and the authority and director are required to verify that the taxpayer has met the goals outlined in its plan. Specifically, a taxpayer is required to satisfy at least two of the following criteria to qualify for the additional promotional credit: (1)   the creation of a video at least three minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority; (2)   the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at publicly accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State; (3)   the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl and after contractual credit placement obligations; (4)   the film is set, at least in part, in New Jersey, and the State is referenced in the film; (5)   support for a workforce development program established by a college, including a community college, an apprentice program, or a university in this State, which program includes direct training or employment opportunities on the film for residents of this State; (6)   a film industry recruiting program established by the taxpayer providing paid internships or entry level employment opportunities in film crew positions for New Jersey residents of an economically disadvantaged New Jersey area, a distressed municipality, or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; (7)   the taxpayer engages at least five vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey, each of which employs at least one full-time employee at a physical location in an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality, or on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; and (8)   any alternative criteria as the authority may provide. However, unless a taxpayer is eligible for additional credit under the bill for a television series that relocated to New Jersey, the additional promotional credit allowed under the bill may be increased to nine percent, provided that at least four of the above criteria are met. Modification of Definitions This bill amends the definition of commitment period for New Jersey studio partners under the program to be the period beginning with the commencement of the eligibility period and continuing for a minimum of 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term, as appropriate.  Under current law, the commitment period expires 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term. The bill also amends the definition of eligibility period, in the case of a taxpayer leasing a production facility, to mean the period beginning at the commencement of the lease term for the production facility leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and extending thereafter for a term of not less than 10 years.  Under current law, the term is limited to a maximum of 10 years. The bill includes within the definition of film, for a New Jersey studio partner, an ongoing television production that relocated to New Jersey and features news or current events, which may include sports themed current events programming, but shall not include a sports event, provided that the ongoing television production relocates to a New Jersey studio partner facility that is leased or owned by the New Jersey studio partner. The bill amends the definition of highly compensated individual to remove a distinction under current law that, for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, an individual who directly or indirectly receives compensation in excess of $500,000 for the performance of services used directly in a production.  Instead, for any taxpayer, the term means an individual who directly or indirectly receives compensation in excess of $750,000 for the performance of services used directly in a production. The bill amends the definition of New Jersey film-lease production company, in relevant part, to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of a combined group or any other entity in which the film-lease production company has a material ownership interest and has oversight of operations of the entity, as demonstrated by the control of at least one board of director position or other management responsibilities, or has a material operational role in the production, which taxpayer meets additional requirements.  Under current law, the term includes a taxpayer that is a member of a combined group or any other entity in which the film-lease production company has a material ownership interest and material operation role in the production, among additional requirements. The bill further amends the definition of a New Jersey film-lease production company to include any other member of a taxpayer's combined group, any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease production company has a material ownership interest, or an unrelated entity principally engaged in the production of a film or other commercial audiovisual product with whom a designated New Jersey film-lease production company contracts to perform film production services on its behalf such that the designated New Jersey film-lease production company:  (1) controls such film or product during preproduction, production, and postproduction; or (2) controls distribution rights for the resulting film or other commercial audiovisual product, provided that the New Jersey film-lease production company contracted with the unrelated entity prior to qualified film production expenses being incurred.  Under current law, this term includes an unrelated entity engaged in the production of a film or other commercial audiovisual product with whom a designated New Jersey film-lease production company contracts to perform film production services on its behalf such that the designated New Jersey film-lease production company controls such film or product during preproduction, production, and postproduction and all results and proceeds of such services constitute, from the moment of creation, works made for hire for the New Jersey film-lease production company pursuant to the provisions of the federal Copyright Act of 1976. The bill modifies the definition of qualified film production expenses, as it applies to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, to include: the total script costs of any script written within New Jersey; or the product of the total script costs of any script written outside New Jersey and the percentage of the principal photography shoot days in New Jersey relative to the total principal photography shoot days for the film.  Under current law, script costs are not included in qualified film production expenses.  A New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is permitted, under the bill, to include script costs, including the cost of script purchase. State Purchase of Tax Credits Under current law, the director is permitted to purchase unused tax credits awarded under various economic development programs established under the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, including the Aspire Program and the Cultural Arts Incentives Program. Under the bill, the director is required to purchase unused tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates awarded under the Aspire Program and the Cultural Arts Incentives Program in an amount equal to 85 percent of the value of the tax credit, provided that certain conditions are met.  The bill also requires that the director purchase unused tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates awarded under the film and digital media content production tax credit program in an amount equal to 95 percent of the value of the tax credit, provided that certain conditions are met.  In each case, the bill requires the issuance date of the tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate to have occurred at least one year prior to the date of application to the director.

The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000;

Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law to the contrary, if a film production company designated as a New Jersey studio partner ceases to qualify for its designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey film-lease production companies in each fiscal year by a corresponding amount pursuant to a formula established in rules adopted by the authority which shall consider the volume of applications submitted by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, the cumulative total amount of tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities in the prior fiscal year, the total square footage of facility space occupied in the State by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, and any other factors that the authority deems appropriate.  Award agreements between the authority and New Jersey studio partners shall include a requirement for each New Jersey studio partner to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period.  If a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period or otherwise fails to satisfy the conditions for designation as a New Jersey studio partner, except for the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner, the authority [shall] may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall [terminate] be reduced to eliminate the portion of the tax credits only available by virtue of such designation.  Notwithstanding any law, regulation, or rule to the contrary, in the event of a recapture of tax credits, the tax credits shall only be recaptured from the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  The authority shall establish a non-binding, administrative pre-certification process for potentially eligible projects.

If the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for taxable years or privilege periods commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000;

(cf: P.L.2025, c.2, s.9) 5.    (New section) a. A taxpayer that is a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company, upon approval of an application submitted pursuant to P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b et al.) by the authority and the director, shall be allowed an additional tax credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during a tax period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049, provided that: (1)   the application is accompanied by a plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey, which plan shall include at least two of the following criteria: (a)   the creation of a video at least three minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, a taxpayer shall provide a list of locations in New Jersey used for the film and relevant footage for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (b)   the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at publicly accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State. The social media posts shall originate from an official account of the taxpayer or the film, or as otherwise permitted by the authority.  To receive credit for this promotional criterion, the taxpayer shall provide the Internet website on which the post is publicly visible for use by the authority for promotional purposes; (c)   the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl and after contractual credit placement obligations; (d)   the film is set, at least in part, in New Jersey, and the State is referenced in the film; (e)   support for a workforce development program established by a college, including a community college, an apprentice program, or a university in this State, which program includes direct training or employment opportunities on the film for residents of this State; (f)   a film industry recruiting program established by the taxpayer providing paid internships or entry level employment opportunities in film crew positions for State residents of an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality as that term is defined in section 55 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323), or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; (g)   the taxpayer engages at least five vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey that employ at least one full-time employee at a physical location in an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality as that term is defined in section 55 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323), or on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; and (h)   any alternative criteria as the authority shall provide pursuant to subsection c. of this section; and (2)   the director and the authority have verified that the taxpayer met the goals outlined in the plan submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Unless the taxpayer a film that is eligible for an additional tax credit for a television series that relocated to New Jersey, pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) or paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), in addition to the credit provided pursuant to subsection a. of this section, a taxpayer that is a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company, upon approval of an application submitted pursuant to P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b et al.) by the authority and the director, shall be allowed an additional tax credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer incurred during a tax period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049, provided that the taxpayers plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey includes a total of at least four of the criteria in paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section. c.     The authority shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this section, including, at a minimum, alternative promotional criteria, approved social media platforms, and requirements for a vendors physical location. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to applications submitted after the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of the film and digital media content production tax credit program (program) administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Among other changes, the bill extends the programs availability until July 2049, ten years longer than it is available under current law. Increased Tax Credit Awards This bill increases the amount of tax credits that may be awarded to a New Jersey studio partner under the program, from 35 percent to 40 percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses during a tax period, when the expenses are incurred for services performed and tangible personal property purchased for use at a sound stage or other location within the State and within a 30-mile radius of the intersection of Eighth Avenue/Central Park West, Broadway, and West 59th Street/Central Park South, New York, New York. Incentive to Relocate Television Series to New Jersey This bill provides that a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is eligible for an additional tax credit in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of the taxpayers qualified film production expenses incurred during a taxable period commencing on or after July 1, 2025 but before July 1, 2049 for a film that is a television series that relocated to New Jersey.  The bill defines television series that relocated to New Jersey to mean a scripted television series of at least six episodes, with an average production budget of $2.5 million per episode, and for which all prior seasons of the series were filmed outside New Jersey. New Jersey Film-Lease Post-Production Company The bill defines a New Jersey film-lease post-production company to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of combined group or any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has a material ownership interest and a material operational role in the production, that otherwise complies with the eligibility requirements of the program, has made a commitment to lease or otherwise occupy production space in a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, and satisfies certain criteria set forth in the bill. If a New Jersey film-lease partner facility has not received a temporary or final certificate of occupancy, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company is required to have entered into a lease or sublease with the owner or developer of a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, which lease or sublease is for not less than three years of occupancy of the New Jersey film-lease partner facility and includes at least 36,000 square feet of gross rentable space.  For purposes of satisfying certain provisions in the bill, a New Jersey film-lease post-production company may include in an application the qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for post-production, including visual effects activities that are performed by the New Jersey film-lease post-production company or by a business entity in which the New Jersey film-lease post-production company has an ownership interest of at least 50 percent. Qualified Post-Production Company The bill replaces the definition of independent post-production company with a definition of qualified post-production company and replaces the former term with the latter throughout the bill.  Under the bill, "qualified post-production company" means a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity engaged in post-production, including visual effects activities on a film or films described in this section, including, but not limited to, a film or films that do not satisfy certain requirements under the bill. Under the program, a taxpayers expenses for visual effects services performed by a qualified post-production company may include qualified digital media content production expenses incurred for post-production, including visual effects activities performed by a business entity in which the qualified post-production company has an ownership interest of at least 51 percent. Application and Carry Forward of Credit The bill provides that a taxpayer, including the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate, may use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, the tax period in which it was issued, or in any tax period after the tax period for which it was issued, up to and including the next three successive tax periods after receipt by the purchaser, without the need to amend the return for the year for which the credit was issued. Maximum Credit Availability Under current law, in fiscal year 2024 and in each fiscal year thereafter until the conclusion of the program, the cumulative total awards are limited to $150 million for New Jersey studio partners.  However, the authority may, in its discretion, award an additional $400 million to New Jersey studio partners. This bill amends current law so that, beginning in fiscal year 2026, the maximum cumulative total awards is increased to $300 million for New Jersey studio partners.  In addition, the bill decreases the additional discretionary awards to $250 million for New Jersey studio partners beginning in fiscal year 2026. Recapture of Tax Credits Under current law, the approval of tax credits for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies is subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, the recapture of tax credits.  The bill provides that the recapture of tax credits may only apply to the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate. Current law also provides that if a New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility developed, purchased, or leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner for the duration of the commitment period, the authority is required to recapture certain portions of the tax credit.  This bill instead authorizes the authority to recapture certain portions of the tax credit in these instances.  However, the bill also provides an exception to this recapture provision in any circumstance in which the New Jersey studio partner fails to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner.  The bill includes similar exceptions for failure to occupy the required space for a New Jersey film-lease production or New Jersey film-lease post-production company. Deferred Compensation Under current law, a New Jersey studio partner that makes certain deferred compensation payments is permitted to file a supplemental report no later than two years after the date on which the production concludes.  This bill modifies current law to permit the submission of a supplemental report no later than four years after the date on which the production concludes. Additionally, the bill permits a New Jersey studio partner to include deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, including those payments for which tax was not withheld under the gross income tax, within qualified film production expenses, provided that the payments otherwise satisfy the requirements of the program. Current law permits a New Jersey studio partner that incurs $25 million or more in qualified film production expenses in the State to include within qualified film production expenses, in excess of amounts paid to highly compensated individuals, up to $72 million of certain wages or salaries.  This bill additionally permits a New Jersey studio partner that incurs $125 million or more in qualified film production expenses in the State for the production of a feature film to include within qualified film production expenses, in excess of the amounts paid to highly compensated individuals, amounts paid for scripts, and amounts paid or incurred for deferred compensation, to include up to $72 million of certain wages and salaries. Expansion of Transferred Tax Credit Applicability Under current law, tax credits awarded under the program may be applied against a taxpayers liability under the gross income tax or corporation business tax.  In addition, this bill authorizes the application of transferred credits against a taxpayers liability for an insurance premium tax. Credit for Diversity Plan Under current law, a taxpayer who is eligible for tax credits under the program may receive an additional credit in an amount equal to two percent of the qualified film production expenses or four percent of the digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer during a tax period if: (1) the application is accompanied by a diversity plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring minority persons and women; (2) the director and the authority have approved the plan as meeting the requirements established by the director and the authority; and (3) the director and the authority have verified that the applicant has met or made good faith efforts in achieving those goals. Current law provides that a tax credit for four percent of qualified film production expenses may be available to a taxpayer, rather than two percent, if the diversity plan includes specific goals that include hiring persons as performers in the film who are: (1) women or members of a minority group; (2) residents of New Jersey for at least 12 months preceding the beginning of filming or recording; and (3) members of a bona fide labor union representing film and television performers. This bill removes the additional requirements necessary for a taxpayer to receive a four percent tax credit, rather than two percent, and increases the bonus credit for all eligible applicants.  Under the bill, a taxpayer may earn a credit equal to four and one-half percent of qualified film production expenses for a diversity plan meeting the same criteria required for a credit equal to four percent of digital media content production expenses. In addition, this bill requires, instead of a diversity plan for hiring minority persons, and women, that an application for this additional credit be accompanied by a plan outlining specific goals, which may include advertising and recruitment actions, for hiring residents of an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality, or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005. New Jersey Promotion and Support Credit In addition to the amount of tax credits otherwise allowed under the program, the bill allows an additional promotional tax credit for certain film productions in an amount equal to four and one-half percent of a taxpayers qualified film production expenses or qualified digital media content production expenses under certain conditions. Specifically, a New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film lease production company may qualify for this additional credit by submitting, alongside an application to the authority and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury (director), a plan outlining specific goals to promote or invest in New Jersey.  Under the bill, a taxpayer is required to include at least two promotional criteria in the plan, and the authority and director are required to verify that the taxpayer has met the goals outlined in its plan. Specifically, a taxpayer is required to satisfy at least two of the following criteria to qualify for the additional promotional credit: (1)   the creation of a video at least three minutes in length of publicly accessible locations in New Jersey used for the film, with commentary on how and why each location was chosen, published on the Internet website promoting the film or in another form and manner approved by the authority; (2)   the creation of five public social media posts including commentary on positive experiences at publicly accessible New Jersey locations or positive experiences filming in the State; (3)   the placement of a New Jersey promotional logo provided by the authority for a two-second exposure, not displayed over content or on a shared card, and displayed before the below-the-line crew crawl and after contractual credit placement obligations; (4)   the film is set, at least in part, in New Jersey, and the State is referenced in the film; (5)   support for a workforce development program established by a college, including a community college, an apprentice program, or a university in this State, which program includes direct training or employment opportunities on the film for residents of this State; (6)   a film industry recruiting program established by the taxpayer providing paid internships or entry level employment opportunities in film crew positions for New Jersey residents of an economically disadvantaged New Jersey area, a distressed municipality, or land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; (7)   the taxpayer engages at least five vendors authorized to do business in New Jersey, each of which employs at least one full-time employee at a physical location in an economically disadvantaged area in the State, a distressed municipality, or on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005; and (8)   any alternative criteria as the authority may provide. However, unless a taxpayer is eligible for additional credit under the bill for a television series that relocated to New Jersey, the additional promotional credit allowed under the bill may be increased to nine percent, provided that at least four of the above criteria are met. Modification of Definitions This bill amends the definition of commitment period for New Jersey studio partners under the program to be the period beginning with the commencement of the eligibility period and continuing for a minimum of 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term, as appropriate.  Under current law, the commitment period expires 10 years following the issuance of a temporary certificate of occupancy or commencement of a lease term. The bill also amends the definition of eligibility period, in the case of a taxpayer leasing a production facility, to mean the period beginning at the commencement of the lease term for the production facility leased as a condition of designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and extending thereafter for a term of not less than 10 years.  Under current law, the term is limited to a maximum of 10 years. The bill includes within the definition of film, for a New Jersey studio partner, an ongoing television production that relocated to New Jersey and features news or current events, which may include sports themed current events programming, but shall not include a sports event, provided that the ongoing television production relocates to a New Jersey studio partner facility that is leased or owned by the New Jersey studio partner. The bill amends the definition of highly compensated individual to remove a distinction under current law that, for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, an individual who directly or indirectly receives compensation in excess of $500,000 for the performance of services used directly in a production.  Instead, for any taxpayer, the term means an individual who directly or indirectly receives compensation in excess of $750,000 for the performance of services used directly in a production. The bill amends the definition of New Jersey film-lease production company, in relevant part, to mean a taxpayer, including any taxpayer that is a member of a combined group or any other entity in which the film-lease production company has a material ownership interest and has oversight of operations of the entity, as demonstrated by the control of at least one board of director position or other management responsibilities, or has a material operational role in the production, which taxpayer meets additional requirements.  Under current law, the term includes a taxpayer that is a member of a combined group or any other entity in which the film-lease production company has a material ownership interest and material operation role in the production, among additional requirements. The bill further amends the definition of a New Jersey film-lease production company to include any other member of a taxpayer's combined group, any other entity in which the New Jersey film-lease production company has a material ownership interest, or an unrelated entity principally engaged in the production of a film or other commercial audiovisual product with whom a designated New Jersey film-lease production company contracts to perform film production services on its behalf such that the designated New Jersey film-lease production company:  (1) controls such film or product during preproduction, production, and postproduction; or (2) controls distribution rights for the resulting film or other commercial audiovisual product, provided that the New Jersey film-lease production company contracted with the unrelated entity prior to qualified film production expenses being incurred.  Under current law, this term includes an unrelated entity engaged in the production of a film or other commercial audiovisual product with whom a designated New Jersey film-lease production company contracts to perform film production services on its behalf such that the designated New Jersey film-lease production company controls such film or product during preproduction, production, and postproduction and all results and proceeds of such services constitute, from the moment of creation, works made for hire for the New Jersey film-lease production company pursuant to the provisions of the federal Copyright Act of 1976. The bill modifies the definition of qualified film production expenses, as it applies to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies, to include: the total script costs of any script written within New Jersey; or the product of the total script costs of any script written outside New Jersey and the percentage of the principal photography shoot days in New Jersey relative to the total principal photography shoot days for the film.  Under current law, script costs are not included in qualified film production expenses.  A New Jersey studio partner or New Jersey film-lease production company is permitted, under the bill, to include script costs, including the cost of script purchase. State Purchase of Tax Credits Under current law, the director is permitted to purchase unused tax credits awarded under various economic development programs established under the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, including the Aspire Program and the Cultural Arts Incentives Program. Under the bill, the director is required to purchase unused tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates awarded under the Aspire Program and the Cultural Arts Incentives Program in an amount equal to 85 percent of the value of the tax credit, provided that certain conditions are met.  The bill also requires that the director purchase unused tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates awarded under the film and digital media content production tax credit program in an amount equal to 95 percent of the value of the tax credit, provided that certain conditions are met.  In each case, the bill requires the issuance date of the tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate to have occurred at least one year prior to the date of application to the director.
