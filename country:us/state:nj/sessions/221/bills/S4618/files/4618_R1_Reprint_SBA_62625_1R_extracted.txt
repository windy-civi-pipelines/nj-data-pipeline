b. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362).  Approvals made to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies shall be subject to award agreements with the authority detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, recapture, forfeiture, and termination, except that in the event of a recapture of tax credits, the tax credits shall only be recaptured from the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection or other law to the contrary, if a film production company designated as a New Jersey studio partner ceases to qualify for its designation as a New Jersey film studio partner and becomes designated as a New Jersey film-lease partner facility, the authority shall reduce the cumulative total amount of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners in each fiscal year and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey film-lease production companies in each fiscal year by a corresponding amount pursuant to a formula established in rules adopted by the authority which shall consider the volume of applications submitted by New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities, the cumulative total amount of tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production facilities

designation as a New Jersey studio partner, except for the failure to occupy the production facility for any reason outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner, 1subject to any rules the authority may determine necessary to implement this provision, including, but not limited to, a definition of reasons outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner,1 the authority [shall] may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall [terminate] be reduced to eliminate the portion of the tax credits only available by virtue of such designation.  Notwithstanding any law, regulation, or rule to the contrary, in the event of a recapture of tax credits, the tax credits shall only be recaptured from the initial recipient of the tax credits, not the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  The authority shall establish a non-binding, administrative pre-certification process for potentially eligible projects. If the cumulative total amount of tax credits, and tax credit transfer certificates, allowed to taxpayers for taxable years or privilege periods commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that fiscal year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection a. of this section and subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available.

If the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for taxable years or privilege periods commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) exceeds the amount of tax credits available in that year, then taxpayers who have first applied for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate amount for that reason shall have their applications approved by the authority, provided the application otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, and shall be allowed the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b) are not in excess of the amount of credits available. Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are greater than $2,500, but less than $20,000; a review of 100 randomly selected non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items that are less than $2,500; a review of the qualified wages for the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages; and a review of the qualified wages for 35 randomly selected employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with qualified wages other than the 15 employees, independent contractors, or loan-out companies with the highest qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses shall be adjusted based on any discrepancies identified for the reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items and qualified wages.  The taxpayer's qualified film production expenses and digital media content production expenses also shall be adjusted based on the projection of any discrepancies identified based on the review of randomly selected expense items or wages pursuant to this subsection to the extent that the discrepancies exceed one percent of the total reviewed non-payroll qualified film production expense items, non-payroll digital media content production expense items, or qualified wages.  The determination shall be provided in writing to the taxpayer, and a copy of the written determination shall be included in the filing of a return that includes a claim for a tax credit allowed pursuant to this section. h.    A taxpayer shall withhold from each payment to a loan out company, to an independent contractor, or to a homeowner for the use of a personal residence an amount equal to 6.37 percent of the payment otherwise due.  The amounts withheld shall be deemed to be withholding of liability pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., and the taxpayer shall be deemed to have the rights, duties, and responsibilities of an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes.  The director shall allocate the amounts withheld for a taxable year to the accounts of the individuals who are employees of a loan out company in proportion to the employee's payment by the loan out company in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during the taxable year.  A loan out company that reports its payments to employees in connection with a trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this State or for the rendition of personal services performed in this State during a taxable year shall be relieved of its duties and responsibilities as an employer pursuant to chapter 7 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes for the taxable year for any payments relating to the payments on which the taxpayer withheld.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, qualified film production expenses and qualified digital media content production expenses shall include any payments made by the taxpayer to a loan out company for services performed in New Jersey by individuals who are employees of the loan out company and whose wages and salaries are subject to withholding, but not subject to tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., due to the provisions of a reciprocity agreement with another state.  Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union on behalf of an individual that performed services on a production that tax under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. was not withheld shall constitute qualified film production expenses, provided that the payment otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section. i.     As used in this section: "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.
