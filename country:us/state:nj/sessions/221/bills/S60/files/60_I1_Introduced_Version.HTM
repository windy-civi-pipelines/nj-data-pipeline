If the county board of health determines that the establishment or venue has submitted insufficient documentation for a determination of eligibility, then the establishment or venue shall have seven days from the date of the boards notice of insufficient information to provide the necessary documentation. c.     If a regions activity level of coronavirus disease 2019 increases above low but no higher than moderate, as determined in the Department of Healths COVID-19 Activity Report, and an establishment or venue complies with the certification and other requirements established under paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section, all establishments or venues within the region shall maintain their indoor operations to a maximum of 50 percent capacity of the establishment or venues capacity. d.    Any person may report a suspected violation of this act to the appropriate county board of health.  The board of health or county health department to which the violation was reported shall investigate the alleged violation.  If it is determined that the establishment or venue violated the provisions of this act, the county board of health shall have the discretion to reduce the capacity of the establishment or venue until the violation is remediated to the satisfaction of the county board of health.  As an alternative to a reduction in capacity, a county board of health may issue a stop-work order to an establishment or venue in violation of this act.  The order shall remain in effect until the county board of health issues an order releasing the stop-work order upon finding that the establishment or venue is in compliance with this act. e.     The Department of Health shall routinely update and publish its COVID-19 Activity Level Report and distribute the report, as updated, to all the county boards of health in a timely manner.  The department shall post this information on its website and report its findings to each county on a monthly basis. f.     Nothing in this act shall be construed to relieve a food or beverage establishment, or a banquet or wedding venue, of any requirement established by any other law or regulation. g.    Notwithstanding the provisions of this act, if the Governor issues an executive order permitting food or beverage establishments, or banquet or wedding venues, to operate at a higher capacity indoors without compliance with the requirements of this act, the requirements of this act shall not prohibit such establishments or venues from operating in accordance with the Governors executive order. h.    The Commissioner of Health, in consultation with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, shall establish rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of this act.  A county board of health may request assistance from the Departments of Health and Labor and Workforce Development, or appropriate political subdivisions of the State, in implementing the provisions of this act. i.     As used in this act, and notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, food or beverage establishment includes restaurants, cafeterias, dining establishments, and food courts, with or without a liquor license, bars, and all other holders of a liquor license with retail consumption privileges. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall expire on the later of: a.     the date of expiration, termination, or rescission of any and all executive or administrative orders issued by the Governor or Commissioner of Health establishing occupancy or customer seating restrictions related to coronavirus disease 2019 that are applicable to food or beverage establishments or venues; or b.    the first day of the seventh month next following the date on which the Governor declares that the state of emergency declared in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has ended. STATEMENT The bill establishes certain requirements concerning the indoor operation of food or beverage establishments and of banquet and weddings venues during the public health emergency declared in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  The bill defines the term food or beverage establishment to include restaurants, cafeterias, dining establishments, and food courts, with or without a liquor license, bars, and all other holders of a liquor license with retail consumption privileges. Under the bill, the default indoor capacity percentage for food or beverage establishments and banquet and wedding venues will be the maximum capacity authorized by the Governor by executive order.  In areas with a COVID-19 activity level of low, as determined by the Department of Health (DOH), food or beverage establishments and banquet or wedding venues, will be authorized to operate at full capacity, provided they meet the requirements of the bill.  In areas with a COVID-19 activity level higher than low, but no higher than moderate, the indoor capacity percentage will be 50 percent.  In the event the Governor authorizes a higher capacity than is authorized under the bill, and does not require compliance with the requirements of the bill, the provisions of the bill will not apply to that increased capacity. Specifically, under the bill, within regions of the State that have a low level of COVID-19 activity, an establishment or venue may provide indoor service to a number of persons at full capacity if the establishment or venue institutes: (1)  employee protocols to monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19; (2)  a policy requiring the business to suspend operations immediately for cleaning and disinfection if someone with COVID-19 is on the premises; (3)  a sick leave policy; (4)  a six feet social distancing policy; (5)  a policy to erect physical barriers if it is not possible to maintain a six feet social distancing policy; (6)  a limit to the number of persons that may be seated together at the same time; (7)  an employee hand-washing policy; (8)  the installation of hand-sanitizer dispensers or stations at the entrance to, and throughout, the establishment or venue; (9)  a mask policy; (10)  ventilation protocols; (11)  cleaning and disinfection protocols; (12)  signage protocols; and (13)  communication and training protocols. The establishment or venue will also be required to install barriers between each table; limit parties dining together to 10 or fewer individuals; inform the county board of health of the establishments or venues capacity; and shut down immediately to clean and disinfect upon identifying an employee, guest, visitor, or vendor who is presumptive positive or tests positive for COVID-19. Additionally, the bill requires an establishment or venue to conduct contact tracing upon identifying a dine-in customer with a presumptive positive case or a positive case of COVID-19.  This requirement would not apply to customers who order takeout or delivery from an establishment or venue. The county board of health has the ability to order a reduction in capacity or to shut down establishments or venues that are in violation of the requirements established under the bill. An establishment or venue may submit an application to operate at 50 percent or full capacity indoors at any time to the county board of health, which will review and determine eligibility to operate at 50 percent or full capacity, as applicable based on the local COVID-19 activity level, within 14 days of receipt of the application.  If the county board of health determines that the establishment or venue has submitted insufficient documentation for a determination of eligibility, then the establishment or venue will have seven days to provide the necessary documentation. The bill provides that county boards of health may seek assistance from State officials or appropriate political subdivisions to help implement the provisions of the bill. The bill requires the DOH to routinely update and publish its COVID-19 Activity Level Report and distribute the report, as updated, to all the county boards of health in a timely manner.  The DOH will be required to post this information on its website and report its findings to each county on a monthly basis. Nothing in the bill is to be construed to relieve an establishment or venue of any requirement established by any other law or regulation.
