(4)   Where the certification is for the death, miscarriage, or stillbirth of the child, the certification need only state the date of death, miscarriage, or stillbirth, whichever is appropriate. In any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that an employee obtain an opinion regarding the serious health condition from a second health care provider designated or approved, but not employed on a regular basis, by the employer.  If the second opinion differs from the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the employer and the employee concerning the serious health condition.  The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employer and the employee. f.     In any case in which the necessity for leave under this act is foreseeable, based upon placement of a child into foster care an expected birth or placement of the child for adoption, the employee shall provide the employer with prior notice of the expected birth or placement of the child for adoption or foster care in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). g.    No employee shall, during any period of leave taken pursuant to this section, perform services on a full-time basis for any person for whom the employee did not provide those services immediately prior to commencement of the leave. h.    An employer may deny family leave to the employee if: (1)   The employee is a salaried employee who is among the highest paid 5% of the employer's employees or the seven highest paid employees of the employer, whichever is greater; (2)   The denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the employer's operations; and (3)   The employer notifies the employee of its intent to deny the leave at the time the employer determines that the denial is necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when, in the event of a state of emergency declared by the Governor or when indicated to be needed by the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority, the family leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease. i.     In any case in which the leave has already commenced at the time of the notification pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection h. of this section, the employee shall return to work within 10 working days of the date of notification. j.     In the case of leave taken due to an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the leave may be taken intermittently if: (1) the covered individual provides the employer with prior notice of the leave as soon as practicable; and (2) the covered individual makes a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer and, if possible, provide the employer, prior to the commencement of the intermittent leave, with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent leave will be taken.

(4)   Where the certification is for the death, miscarriage, or stillbirth of the child, the certification need only state the date of death, miscarriage, or stillbirth, whichever is appropriate. In any case in which the employer has reason to doubt the validity of the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that an employee obtain an opinion regarding the serious health condition from a second health care provider designated or approved, but not employed on a regular basis, by the employer.  If the second opinion differs from the certification provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employer may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated or approved jointly by the employer and the employee concerning the serious health condition.  The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered to be final and shall be binding on the employer and the employee. f.     In any case in which the necessity for leave under this act is foreseeable, based upon placement of a child into foster care an expected birth or placement of the child for adoption, the employee shall provide the employer with prior notice of the expected birth or placement of the child for adoption or foster care in the manner specified by the provisions of section 11 of P.L.2008, c.17 (C.43:21-39.2). g.    No employee shall, during any period of leave taken pursuant to this section, perform services on a full-time basis for any person for whom the employee did not provide those services immediately prior to commencement of the leave. h.    An employer may deny family leave to the employee if: (1)   The employee is a salaried employee who is among the highest paid 5% of the employer's employees or the seven highest paid employees of the employer, whichever is greater; (2)   The denial is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the employer's operations; and (3)   The employer notifies the employee of its intent to deny the leave at the time the employer determines that the denial is necessary. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply when, in the event of a state of emergency declared by the Governor or when indicated to be needed by the Commissioner of Health or other public health authority, the family leave is for an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to a communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of a communicable disease. i.     In any case in which the leave has already commenced at the time of the notification pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection h. of this section, the employee shall return to work within 10 working days of the date of notification. j.     In the case of leave taken due to an epidemic of a communicable disease, a known or suspected exposure to the communicable disease, or efforts to prevent spread of the communicable disease, the leave may be taken intermittently if: (1) the covered individual provides the employer with prior notice of the leave as soon as practicable; and (2) the covered individual makes a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer and, if possible, provide the employer, prior to the commencement of the intermittent leave, with a regular schedule of the day or days of the week on which the intermittent leave will be taken.

When determining the "average weekly wage" with respect to a period of family temporary disability leave for an individual who has a period of family temporary disability immediately after the individual has a period of disability for the individual's own disability, the period of disability is deemed to have commenced at the beginning of the period of disability for the individual's own disability, not the period of family temporary disability. (k)   "Child" means a biological, adopted, or foster child, stepchild or legal ward of a covered individual, child of a domestic partner of the covered individual, or child of a civil union partner of the covered individual, including a child who becomes the child of a parent pursuant to a valid written agreement between the parent and a gestational carrier.
