A3399 ASSEMBLY, No. 3399 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 1, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JAY WEBBER District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Waives certain inspection fees for municipally owned affordable housing developments. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act waiving certain inspection fees for municipally owned affordable housing developments and amending P.L.1967, c.76. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 13 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  (a)   Each multiple dwelling and each hotel shall be inspected  for the purpose of determining the extent to which each hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder.  The commissioner shall establish by regulation the frequency of inspections, which shall be conducted as follows: (1)   each hotel shall be inspected at least once every five years; and (2)   each multiple dwelling shall be categorized into the following tiers based upon the number of reinspections required to abate the violations that were served upon the owner following an initial inspection: (i)    a multiple dwelling in which no violations are found or all violations have been abated by the first reinspection shall be placed in the highest tier and shall next be inspected in seven years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (ii)   a multiple dwelling in which all violations have been abated by the second or third reinspection shall be placed in the middle tier and shall next be inspected in five years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (iii)   a multiple dwelling in which all violations have not been abated by the third reinspection shall be placed in the lowest tier and shall next be inspected in two years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time. (3)   notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section to the contrary, if the commissioner determines that tiered inspection schedules do not adequately protect the health and safety of residents of multiple dwellings, the commissioner may, by regulation, require that cyclical inspections for multiple dwellings occur once every five years. (b)   Within 30 days of the most recent inspection, the owner of each hotel shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows: $15 per unit of dwelling space for the first 20 units of dwelling space in any building or project, $12 per unit of dwelling space for the 21st through 100th unit in any building or project, $8 per unit of dwelling space for the 101st through 250th unit in any building or project, and $5 per unit of dwelling space for all units over 250 in any building or project, except that in the case of hotels open and operating less than six months in each year the fee shall be one-half that which would otherwise be required, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for hotels in the amount of $10 for each dwelling unit reinspected or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Within 30 days of the most recent inspection of any multiple dwelling occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more persons living independently of each other, the owner of each such multiple dwelling shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee of $33 per unit of dwelling space for the first 7 units in any building or project, $21 per unit of dwelling space for the 8th through the 24th unit in any building or project, $18 per unit for the 25th through the 48th unit in any building or project, and $12 per unit of dwelling space for all units of dwelling space over 48 in any building or project, provided that the maximum total fee for owner-occupied three-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $65 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, and the maximum total fee for owner-occupied four-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $80 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.  A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for multiple dwellings in the amount of $40 for each dwelling unit reinspected, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, but only after the first reinspection. The commissioner may waive the inspection fee for any unit upon a finding that the unit has been thoroughly inspected within the previous 12-month period under a municipal ordinance requiring inspection upon change of occupancy in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and has received a municipal certificate of occupancy as a result of that inspection. If the commissioner finds that (1) a building has been thoroughly inspected prior to resale since the most recent inspection in accordance with this section, (2) the inspection prior to resale was conducted by the municipality in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and (3) a municipal certificate of occupancy was issued as a result of that inspection, the commissioner may accept the inspection done prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection under this section.  If the commissioner accepts an inspection prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection, no fee shall be charged for any inspection done by the commissioner within the years remaining in the applicable inspection cycle after the date of the inspection so accepted. The commissioner shall waive the inspection fee for the first inspection conducted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section with respect to a multiple dwelling which is owned by a municipality or an agency or instrumentality thereof, including any municipal authority, and each unit of which is dedicated as very low income housing, low income housing, or moderate income housing, as those terms are defined in section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). (c)   If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof, upon receipt of the application and fee as required by subsection (b) of this section, a certificate of inspection.  Any owner to whom a certificate of inspection is issued shall keep said certificate posted in a conspicuous location in the hotel or multiple dwelling to which the certificate applies.  The certificate of inspection shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, upon finding a consistent pattern of compliance with the maintenance standards established under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) in at least 20 percent of the units in a building or project, issue a certificate of inspection for the building or project, in which case the inspection fee shall be charged on the basis of the number of units inspected. The commissioner may by rule establish standards for self-inspection by condominium associations exercising control over buildings of not more than three stories, constructed after 1976, and certified by the local enforcing agency having jurisdiction as being in compliance with the Uniform Fire Code promulgated pursuant to P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), in which at least 80 percent of the dwelling units are occupied by the unit owners.  The commissioner shall issue a certificate of acceptance, which shall be in lieu of a certificate of inspection, upon acceptance of any such self-inspection and upon payment of a fee of $25. (d)   If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a written notice stating the manner in which any such hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder. Said notice shall fix such date, not less than 60 days nor more than 180 days, on or before which any such hotel or multiple dwelling must comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is not made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall not issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section, and shall enforce the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) against the owner thereof. (e)   The commissioner shall annually review the cost of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), including the cost to municipalities of carrying out inspections pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-21), and shall establish by rule, not more frequently than once every three years, such fees as may be necessary to cover the costs of such implementation and enforcement; provided, however, that any increase or decrease shall be applied as a uniform percentage to each category of fee established herein, and provided, further, that the percentage amount of any increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in salaries paid to State employees since the then current fee schedule was established.  The commissioner shall provide by rule to owners the option of paying inspection fees in installments in the form of an annual fee. The commissioner shall annually prepare and file with the presiding officers of the Senate and General Assembly and the legislative committees having jurisdiction in housing matters a report setting forth the amounts of fees and penalties received by the Bureau of Housing Inspection, the cost to the bureau of enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and information concerning the productivity of the bureau.  Copies of the report shall also be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New Jersey Register.  If in any State fiscal year the fee revenue received by the bureau exceeds the cost of enforcement of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), the excess revenue shall be distributed pro rata to persons who paid inspection fees during that fiscal year. Such distribution shall be made within three months after the end of the fiscal year. (f)   Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of P.L.1991, c.179 (C.55:13A-26.1), the fees established by or pursuant to the provisions of this section are dedicated to meeting the costs of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and shall not be used for any other purpose.  All receipts in excess of $2,200,000 are hereby appropriated for the purposes of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2019, c.202, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to January 1, 2017. STATEMENT This bill would waive the fees for the initial five-year inspection under the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) for municipally owned affordable housing developments.  To qualify for this fee waiver, a multiple dwelling would have to be owned by a municipality and every unit in the building would have to be dedicated as affordable housing.  This bill would help limit the costs borne by municipalities, and ultimately property taxpayers, in the production of affordable housing.
