<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 13 of P.L.1967,
c.76 (C.55:13A-13) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  (a)   Each multiple
dwelling and each hotel shall be inspected  for the purpose of determining the
extent to which each hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of
P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder.  The
commissioner shall establish by regulation the frequency of inspections, which
shall be conducted as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   each hotel shall be
inspected at least once every five years; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   each multiple dwelling
shall be categorized into the following tiers based upon the number of
reinspections required to abate the violations that were served upon the owner
following an initial inspection:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    a multiple dwelling in
which no violations are found or all violations have been abated by the first
reinspection shall be placed in the highest tier and shall next be inspected in
seven years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   a multiple dwelling in
which all violations have been abated by the second or third reinspection shall
be placed in the middle tier and shall next be inspected in five years, and the
inspection fee shall be due at that time;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)   a multiple dwelling in
which all violations have not been abated by the third reinspection shall be
placed in the lowest tier and shall next be inspected in two years, and the
inspection fee shall be due at that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (2) of this section to the contrary, if the
commissioner determines that tiered inspection schedules do not adequately
protect the health and safety of residents of multiple dwellings, the
commissioner may, by regulation, require that cyclical inspections for multiple
dwellings occur once every five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Within 30 days of the
most recent inspection, the owner of each hotel shall file with the
commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a
certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as
the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said
application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows: $15 per unit of dwelling
space for the first 20 units of dwelling space in any building or project, $12
per unit of dwelling space for the 21st through 100th unit in any building or
project, $8 per unit of dwelling space for the 101st through 250th unit in any
building or project, and $5 per unit of dwelling space for all units over 250
in any building or project, except that in the case of hotels open and
operating less than six months in each year the fee shall be one-half that
which would otherwise be required, or, as the case may be, the fees established
by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A
certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more
often than once each inspection cycle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, there shall be
reinspection fees for hotels in the amount of $10 for each dwelling unit
reinspected or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of
the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 30 days of the most
recent inspection of any multiple dwelling occupied or intended to be occupied
by three or more persons living independently of each other, the owner of each
such multiple dwelling shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by
the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said
application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe
to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied
by a fee of $33 per unit of dwelling space for the first 7 units in any
building or project, $21 per unit of dwelling space for the 8th through the
24th unit in any building or project, $18 per unit for the 25th through the
48th unit in any building or project, and $12 per unit of dwelling space for
all units of dwelling space over 48 in any building or project, provided that
the maximum total fee for owner-occupied three-unit multiple dwellings shall be
limited to $65 for owners having a household income that is less than 80
percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in
which the multiple dwelling is located, and the maximum total fee for
owner-occupied four-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $80 for owners
having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for
households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is
located, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the
foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.  A certificate of
inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once
each inspection cycle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, there shall be
reinspection fees for multiple dwellings in the amount of $40 for each dwelling
unit reinspected, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule pursuant
to subsection (e) of this section, but only after the first reinspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may waive the
inspection fee for any unit upon a finding that the unit has been thoroughly
inspected within the previous 12-month period under a municipal ordinance
requiring inspection upon change of occupancy in accordance with the
maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76
(C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and has received a municipal certificate of occupancy as
a result of that inspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the commissioner finds that
(1) a building has been thoroughly inspected prior to resale since the most
recent inspection in accordance with this section, (2) the inspection prior to
resale was conducted by the municipality in accordance with the maintenance
standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et
seq.), and (3) a municipal certificate of occupancy was issued as a result of
that inspection, the commissioner may accept the inspection done prior to
resale in lieu of a current inspection under this section.  If the commissioner
accepts an inspection prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection, no fee

remaining in the applicable inspection cycle after the date of the inspection
so accepted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The commissioner shall
waive the inspection fee for the first inspection conducted pursuant to
subsection (a) of this section with respect to a multiple dwelling which is
owned by a municipality or an agency or instrumentality thereof, including any
municipal authority, and each unit of which is dedicated as very low income
housing, low income housing, or moderate income housing, as those terms are
defined in section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.).</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   If the commissioner
determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple
dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or
multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et
seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder, then the commissioner shall issue
to the owner thereof, upon receipt of the application and fee as required by
subsection (b) of this section, a certificate of inspection.  Any owner to whom
a certificate of inspection is issued shall keep said certificate posted in a
conspicuous location in the hotel or multiple dwelling to which the certificate
applies.  The certificate of inspection shall be in such form as may be
prescribed by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may, upon
finding a consistent pattern of compliance with the maintenance standards
established under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) in at least 20 percent of
the units in a building or project, issue a certificate of inspection for the
building or project, in which case the inspection fee shall be charged on the
basis of the number of units inspected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may by rule
establish standards for self-inspection by condominium associations exercising
control over buildings of not more than three stories, constructed after 1976,
and certified by the local enforcing agency having jurisdiction as being in
compliance with the Uniform Fire Code promulgated pursuant to P.L.1983, c.383
(C.52:27D-192 et seq.), in which at least 80 percent of the dwelling units are
occupied by the unit owners.  The commissioner shall issue a certificate of
acceptance, which shall be in lieu of a certificate of inspection, upon
acceptance of any such self-inspection and upon payment of a fee of $25.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   If the commissioner
determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple
dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or
multiple dwelling does not comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76
(C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder, then the
commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a written notice stating the
manner in which any such hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with
P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder. 
Said notice shall fix such date, not less than 60 days nor more than 180 days,
on or before which any such hotel or multiple dwelling must comply with the
provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated
thereunder.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the
provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated
thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner
shall issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in
subsection (c) of this section.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is not
made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and

then the commissioner shall not issue to the owner thereof a certificate of
inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section, and shall enforce
the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) against the owner
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The commissioner shall
annually review the cost of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76
(C.55:13A-1 et seq.), including the cost to municipalities of carrying out
inspections pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-21), and shall
establish by rule, not more frequently than once every three years, such fees
as may be necessary to cover the costs of such implementation and enforcement;
provided, however, that any increase or decrease shall be applied as a uniform
percentage to each category of fee established herein, and provided, further,
that the percentage amount of any increase shall not exceed the percentage
increase in salaries paid to State employees since the then current fee
schedule was established.  The commissioner shall provide by rule to owners the
option of paying inspection fees in installments in the form of an annual fee. 
The commissioner shall annually prepare and file with the presiding officers of
the Senate and General Assembly and the legislative committees having
jurisdiction in housing matters a report setting forth the amounts of fees and
penalties received by the Bureau of Housing Inspection, the cost to the bureau
of enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and information concerning
the productivity of the bureau.  Copies of the report shall also be submitted
to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New Jersey
Register.  If in any State fiscal year the fee revenue received by the bureau
exceeds the cost of enforcement of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), the
excess revenue shall be distributed pro rata to persons who paid inspection
fees during that fiscal year. Such distribution shall be made within three
months after the end of the fiscal year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   Except as otherwise
provided in section 2 of P.L.1991, c.179 (C.55:13A-26.1), the fees established
by or pursuant to the provisions of this section are dedicated to meeting the
costs of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and
shall not be used for any other purpose.  All receipts in excess of $2,200,000
are hereby appropriated for the purposes of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would waive the fees
for the initial five-year inspection under the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling
Law,&quot; P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) for municipally owned affordable
housing developments.  To qualify for this fee waiver, a multiple dwelling
would have to be owned by a municipality and every unit in the building would
have to be dedicated as affordable housing.  This bill would help limit the
costs borne by municipalities, and ultimately property taxpayers, in the
production of affordable housing.</p>
