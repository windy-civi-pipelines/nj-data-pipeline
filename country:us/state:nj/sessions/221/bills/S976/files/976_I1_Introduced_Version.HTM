Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.     Section 1 of P.L.2003,
c.206 (C.2C:14-9) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  An actor commits a
crime of the fourth degree if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to
do so, and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would know that
another may expose intimate parts or may engage in sexual penetration or sexual
contact, he observes another person without that person's consent and under
circumstances in which a reasonable person would not expect to be observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  An actor commits a
crime of the third degree if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to
do so, he photographs, films, videotapes, records, or otherwise reproduces in
any manner, the image of another person whose intimate parts are exposed or who
is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact, without that
person's consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would not
expect to be observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An actor commits a crime
of the fourth degree if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do
so, he photographs, films, videotapes, records, or otherwise reproduces in any
manner, the image of the undergarment-clad intimate parts of another person,
without that person's consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable
person would not expect to have his undergarment-clad intimate parts observed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     An actor commits a
crime of the third degree if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to
do so, he discloses any photograph, film, videotape, recording or any other
reproduction of the image, taken in violation of subsection b. of this section,
<u>or any deceptive audio or visual media,</u> of: (1) another person who is
engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact; (2) another person
whose intimate parts are exposed; or (3) another person's undergarment-clad
intimate parts, unless that person has consented to such disclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of this
subsection: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) disclose means sell,
manufacture, give, provide, lend, trade, mail, deliver, transfer, publish,
distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, advertise, offer, share,
or make available via the Internet or by any other means, whether for pecuniary
gain or not; <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) intimate parts has the
meaning ascribed to it in N.J.S.2C:14-1<u>; and </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(3) deceptive audio or
visual media means any video recording, motion picture film, sound recording,
electronic image, or photograph, or any technological representation of speech
or conduct substantially derivative thereof that appears to authentically depict
any speech or conduct of a person who did not in fact engage in the speech or
conduct and the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical
means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally
impersonate the person</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the provisions
of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, a fine not to exceed $30,000 may be imposed
for a violation of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is an affirmative
defense to a crime under this section that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the actor posted or
otherwise provided prior notice to the person of the actor's intent to engage
in the conduct specified in subsection a., b., or c., and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the actor acted with a
lawful purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  (1)  It shall not be a
violation of subsection a. or b. to observe another person in the access way,
foyer or entrance to a fitting room or dressing room operated by a retail
establishment or to photograph, film, videotape, record or otherwise reproduce
the image of such person, if the actor conspicuously posts at the entrance to
the fitting room or dressing room prior notice of his intent to make the
observations, photographs, films, videotapes, recordings or other
reproductions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   It shall be a violation
of subsection c. to disclose in any manner any such photograph, film, videotape
or recording of another person using a fitting room or dressing room except
under the following circumstances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   to law enforcement
officers in connection with a criminal prosecution;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   pursuant to subpoena or
court order for use in a legal proceeding; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   to a co-worker, manager
or supervisor acting within the scope of his employment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It shall be a violation
of subsection a. or b. to observe another person in a private dressing stall of
a fitting room or dressing room operated by a retail establishment or to
photograph, film, videotape, record or otherwise reproduce the image of another
person in a private dressing stall of a fitting room or dressing room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    For purposes of this
act, a law enforcement officer, or a corrections officer or guard in a
correctional facility or jail, who is engaged in the official performance of
his duties shall be deemed to be licensed or privileged to make and to disclose
observations, photographs, films, videotapes, recordings or any other
reproductions. </p>

in, or who is caused to engage in, a prohibited sexual act or simulation of a
prohibited sexual act or portrayed in a sexually suggestive manner is under the

artificial intelligence with the intent of making it appear, as realistically
as possible, that the person being depicted has engaged in activity that did
not actually occur.  Deepfakes have been intentionally used to embarrass or
