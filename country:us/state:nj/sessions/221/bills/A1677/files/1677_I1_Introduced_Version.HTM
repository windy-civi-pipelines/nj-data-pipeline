(e)   Construct, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a building with the federal government, the State, a political subdivision thereof or any other individual or entity properly authorized to do business in the State;

(g)   Establish with an individual or entity authorized to do business in the State a tenancy in common, condominium, horizontal property regime or other joint ownership arrangement on a site contributed by the school district; provided the following conditions are met: (1)   The individual or entity agrees to construct on the site, or provide for the construction thereon, a building or buildings for use of the board of education separately or jointly with the individual or entity, which shall be subject to the joint ownership arrangement; (2)   The provision of the building shall be at no cost or at a reduced cost to the board of education; (3)   The school district shall not make any payment for use of the building other than its pro rata share of costs of maintenance and improvements; (4)   The noneducational uses of the building are compatible with the establishment and operation of a school, as determined by the Commissioner of Education; (5)   The portion of the building to be used as a school, and the site, meet regulations of the Department of Education; and (6)   Any such agreement shall be approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs; (h)   Acquire through sale and lease-back textbooks and non-consumable instructional materials provided that the sale price and principal amount of the lease-back do not exceed the fair market value of the textbooks and instructional materials and that the interest rate applied in the lease-back is consistent with prevailing market rates or is less. (cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.7) 4.    Section 42 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-91) is amended to read as follows: 42.  a.  Pursuant to the provisions of sections 42 through 45 of this act, a government aggregator may obtain:  electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities or with other government aggregators; and a government aggregator that is a county or municipality may contract for the provision of electric generation service or gas supply service, either separately or bundled, for the business and residential customers within the territorial jurisdiction of the government aggregator.  Such a government aggregator may combine the need for its own facilities for electric generation service or gas supply service with that of business and residential customers. b.    A government aggregator shall purchase electric generation service and gas supply service only from licensed electric power suppliers and licensed gas suppliers. c.     The government aggregator shall enter into the contract for electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service for its own facilities or with other government aggregators under the provisions of the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., the "County College Contracts Law," P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.1 et seq.), or the "Interlocal Services Act," P.L.1973, c.208 (C.40:8A-1 et seq.), as applicable. d.    Nothing in this act shall preclude the State government or any State independent authority or State college from exercising authority to obtain electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities on an aggregated basis. e.     Nothing in this section shall preclude a government aggregator from aggregating its own accounts for regulated utility services, including basic generation or gas service. f.     Nothing in this act shall preclude any interstate authority or agency from exercising authority to obtain electric generation service or gas supply service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities in this State, including tenants in this State and other utility customers in this State at such facilities, on an aggregated basis. By exercising such authority, no interstate authority or agency shall be deemed to be a public utility pursuant to R.S. 48:1-1 et seq.; provided, however, that nothing in this act shall be construed to exempt such authority or agency from the payment of the market transition charge or its equivalent, imposed pursuant to section 13 of this act, the transition bond charge or its equivalent, imposed pursuant to section 18 of this act and any societal benefits charge or its equivalent, which may be imposed pursuant to section 12 of this act, to the same extent that other customers of an electric public utility pay such charges in conjunction with any transmission and distribution service provided by an electric public utility to the authority or agency. g.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, a private aggregator that is a private institution of higher education may enter into a contract with a licensed electric power supplier other than a municipal system or rural electric cooperative for the provision of electric generation service or electric related service, either separately or bundled, including any private aggregator that is a four-year private institution of higher education which is located within the jurisdiction of a municipal system, or within the franchise area of a rural electric cooperative, as the case may be.  The right hereunder of a four-year private institution of higher education to enter into a contract with a licensed electric power supplier other than the municipal system or rural electric cooperative shall be subject to the condition that the municipal system or rural electric cooperative shall have the right of first refusal to offer a competitive, market-based price for electric power.  For the purposes of this subsection, "municipal system" means a municipality that provides light, heat or power pursuant to the provisions of R.S.40:62-12 et seq. h.    The "New Jersey School Boards Association," established pursuant to N.J.S.18A:6-45, is authorized to serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, in accordance with the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., for members of the association who wish to voluntarily participate.  For purposes of this subsection, electric related service includes electric school buses and related goods and services, including construction projects directly related to those goods and services either individually or in combination. i.     Notwithstanding any provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board shall initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, after notice, provision of the opportunity for comment, and public hearing, interim standards governing government energy aggregation programs. Such standards shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act." j.     No government aggregator shall implement the provisions of section 42, 43, 44, or 45 of this act, as appropriate, prior to the starting date of retail competition pursuant to section 5 of this act, or the date on which the board adopts interim standards pursuant to subsection i. of this section, whichever is earlier. (cf: P.L.2003, c.248, s.2) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill authorizes a board of education to use competitive contracting and enter into extended contracts and lease terms for electric school buses.  The bill also permits the New Jersey School Boards Association to serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric school buses and related goods and services. Under current law a school district may utilize competitive contracting in lieu of public bidding for the procurement of certain listed specialized goods and services that exceed the bid threshold.  This bill authorizes a board of education to utilize competitive contracting for the purchase of electric school buses, on-site charging infrastructure for electric school buses, and on-site or off-site related electric school bus and charging infrastructure operation and maintenance services, or any combination thereof. Current law permits a school district to enter into a contract for the leasing of school buses for a term not exceeding in the aggregate 10 years.  The bill provides that a school district may enter into a contract for the leasing of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services for a term not in excess of the service life of the electric school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year contract term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses. Also under existing law, a school district may enter into a lease purchase agreement for the acquisition of a school bus for a term not in excess of 10 years.  This bill extends the term of a lease purchase agreement in the case of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services to the service life of the electric school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year lease purchase agreement term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses. Finally, the bill amends the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al), to provide that the New Jersey School Boards Association may serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric school buses and related goods and services, including construction projects directly related to those goods and services either individually or in combination.

(d)   Borrow money therefor, with or without mortgage; in the case of a type II district without a board of school estimate, when authorized so to do at any annual or special school election; and in the case of a type II district having a board of school estimate, when the amount necessary to be provided therefor shall have been fixed, determined and certified by the board of school estimate; and in the case of a type I district, when an ordinance authorizing expenditures for such purpose is finally adopted by the governing body of a municipality comprised within the district; provided, however, that no such election shall be held nor shall any such resolution of a school estimate board or ordinance of a municipal governing body be introduced to authorize any lease of any building for a term exceeding one year, until the proposed terms of such lease have been reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs; (e)   Construct, purchase, lease or otherwise acquire a building with the federal government, the State, a political subdivision thereof or any other individual or entity properly authorized to do business in the State; provided that: (1) the noneducational uses of the building are compatible with the establishment and operation of a school, as determined by the Commissioner of Education; (2) the portion of the building to be used as a school meets regulations of the Department of Education; (3) the board of education has complied with the provisions of law and regulations relating to the selection and approval of sites; and (4) in the case of a lease, that any lease in excess of five years shall be approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs; (f)   Acquire, with the approval of either the commissioner, or voters or board of school estimate, as applicable, improvements or additions to school buildings through lease purchase agreements not in excess of five years.  The agreement shall be recorded as an expenditure of the General Fund of the district.  The commissioner shall approve the agreement only upon a demonstration by the district that the lease purchase payments and any operating expenses related to the agreement can be included within the district's tax levy growth limitation and will not result in the need for approval by the voters or board of school estimate, as appropriate, of additional spending proposals to maintain existing instructional programs and extracurricular activities.  If the commissioner cannot approve the agreement, the board of education may frame a separate question to authorize the lease purchase agreement and obtain voter or board of school estimate approval to enter into the agreement.  A district may, without separate prior approval of the commissioner, also acquire equipment through a lease purchase agreement not in excess of five years or in the case of a lease purchase agreement entered into for the acquisition of fossil fuel school buses not in excess of 10 years and in the case of a lease purchase agreement entered into for the acquisition of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services not in excess of the service life of the electric school buses, provided that the amount of the first installment and each subsequent installment for the lease purchase payments is included in the budget that is advertised and submitted for approval to the voters of the district or the board of school estimate, as appropriate.  As used herein, a "lease purchase agreement" refers to any agreement which gives the board of education as lessee the option of purchasing the leased equipment or improvements or additions to existing school buildings during or upon termination of the lease, with credit toward the purchase price of all or part of rental payments which have been made by the board of education in accordance with the lease.  As part of such a transaction, the board of education may transfer or lease land or rights in land, including any building thereon, after publicly advertising for proposals for the transfer for nominal or fair market value, to the party selected by the board of education, by negotiation or otherwise, after determining that the proposal is in the best interest of the taxpayers of the district, to construct or to improve and to lease or to own or to have ownership interests in the site and the school building to be leased pursuant to such lease purchase agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary.  The land and any building thereon which is described in a lease purchase agreement entered into pursuant to this amendatory act, shall be deemed to be and treated as property of the school district, used for school purposes pursuant to R.S.54:4-3.3, and shall not be considered or treated as property leased to another whose property is not exempt, and shall not be assessed as real estate pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1949, c.177 (C.54:4-2.3).  Any lease purchase agreement authorized by this section shall contain a provision making payments thereunder subject to the annual appropriation of funds sufficient to meet the required payments or shall contain an annual cancellation clause and shall require all construction contracts let by public school districts or let by developers or owners of property used for school purposes to be competitively bid, pursuant to N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq.; (g)   Establish with an individual or entity authorized to do business in the State a tenancy in common, condominium, horizontal property regime or other joint ownership arrangement on a site contributed by the school district; provided the following conditions are met: (1)   The individual or entity agrees to construct on the site, or provide for the construction thereon, a building or buildings for use of the board of education separately or jointly with the individual or entity, which shall be subject to the joint ownership arrangement; (2)   The provision of the building shall be at no cost or at a reduced cost to the board of education; (3)   The school district shall not make any payment for use of the building other than its pro rata share of costs of maintenance and improvements; (4)   The noneducational uses of the building are compatible with the establishment and operation of a school, as determined by the Commissioner of Education; (5)   The portion of the building to be used as a school, and the site, meet regulations of the Department of Education; and (6)   Any such agreement shall be approved by the Commissioner of Education and the Local Finance Board in the Department of Community Affairs; (h)   Acquire through sale and lease-back textbooks and non-consumable instructional materials provided that the sale price and principal amount of the lease-back do not exceed the fair market value of the textbooks and instructional materials and that the interest rate applied in the lease-back is consistent with prevailing market rates or is less. (cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.7) 4.    Section 42 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-91) is amended to read as follows: 42.  a.  Pursuant to the provisions of sections 42 through 45 of this act, a government aggregator may obtain:  electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities or with other government aggregators; and a government aggregator that is a county or municipality may contract for the provision of electric generation service or gas supply service, either separately or bundled, for the business and residential customers within the territorial jurisdiction of the government aggregator.  Such a government aggregator may combine the need for its own facilities for electric generation service or gas supply service with that of business and residential customers. b.    A government aggregator shall purchase electric generation service and gas supply service only from licensed electric power suppliers and licensed gas suppliers. c.     The government aggregator shall enter into the contract for electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service for its own facilities or with other government aggregators under the provisions of the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., the "County College Contracts Law," P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.1 et seq.), or the "Interlocal Services Act," P.L.1973, c.208 (C.40:8A-1 et seq.), as applicable. d.    Nothing in this act shall preclude the State government or any State independent authority or State college from exercising authority to obtain electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities on an aggregated basis. e.     Nothing in this section shall preclude a government aggregator from aggregating its own accounts for regulated utility services, including basic generation or gas service. f.     Nothing in this act shall preclude any interstate authority or agency from exercising authority to obtain electric generation service or gas supply service, either separately or bundled, for its own facilities in this State, including tenants in this State and other utility customers in this State at such facilities, on an aggregated basis. By exercising such authority, no interstate authority or agency shall be deemed to be a public utility pursuant to R.S. 48:1-1 et seq.; provided, however, that nothing in this act shall be construed to exempt such authority or agency from the payment of the market transition charge or its equivalent, imposed pursuant to section 13 of this act, the transition bond charge or its equivalent, imposed pursuant to section 18 of this act and any societal benefits charge or its equivalent, which may be imposed pursuant to section 12 of this act, to the same extent that other customers of an electric public utility pay such charges in conjunction with any transmission and distribution service provided by an electric public utility to the authority or agency. g.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this act to the contrary, a private aggregator that is a private institution of higher education may enter into a contract with a licensed electric power supplier other than a municipal system or rural electric cooperative for the provision of electric generation service or electric related service, either separately or bundled, including any private aggregator that is a four-year private institution of higher education which is located within the jurisdiction of a municipal system, or within the franchise area of a rural electric cooperative, as the case may be.  The right hereunder of a four-year private institution of higher education to enter into a contract with a licensed electric power supplier other than the municipal system or rural electric cooperative shall be subject to the condition that the municipal system or rural electric cooperative shall have the right of first refusal to offer a competitive, market-based price for electric power.  For the purposes of this subsection, "municipal system" means a municipality that provides light, heat or power pursuant to the provisions of R.S.40:62-12 et seq. h.    The "New Jersey School Boards Association," established pursuant to N.J.S.18A:6-45, is authorized to serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric generation service, electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either separately or bundled, in accordance with the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., for members of the association who wish to voluntarily participate.  For purposes of this subsection, electric related service includes electric school buses and related goods and services, including construction projects directly related to those goods and services either individually or in combination. i.     Notwithstanding any provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the board shall initiate a proceeding and shall adopt, after notice, provision of the opportunity for comment, and public hearing, interim standards governing government energy aggregation programs. Such standards shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the board in accordance with the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act." j.     No government aggregator shall implement the provisions of section 42, 43, 44, or 45 of this act, as appropriate, prior to the starting date of retail competition pursuant to section 5 of this act, or the date on which the board adopts interim standards pursuant to subsection i. of this section, whichever is earlier. (cf: P.L.2003, c.248, s.2) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill authorizes a board of education to use competitive contracting and enter into extended contracts and lease terms for electric school buses.  The bill also permits the New Jersey School Boards Association to serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric school buses and related goods and services. Under current law a school district may utilize competitive contracting in lieu of public bidding for the procurement of certain listed specialized goods and services that exceed the bid threshold.  This bill authorizes a board of education to utilize competitive contracting for the purchase of electric school buses, on-site charging infrastructure for electric school buses, and on-site or off-site related electric school bus and charging infrastructure operation and maintenance services, or any combination thereof. Current law permits a school district to enter into a contract for the leasing of school buses for a term not exceeding in the aggregate 10 years.  The bill provides that a school district may enter into a contract for the leasing of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services for a term not in excess of the service life of the electric school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year contract term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses. Also under existing law, a school district may enter into a lease purchase agreement for the acquisition of a school bus for a term not in excess of 10 years.  This bill extends the term of a lease purchase agreement in the case of electric school buses and related charging equipment and services to the service life of the electric school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year lease purchase agreement term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses. Finally, the bill amends the Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al), to provide that the New Jersey School Boards Association may serve as a government aggregator to obtain electric school buses and related goods and services, including construction projects directly related to those goods and services either individually or in combination.
