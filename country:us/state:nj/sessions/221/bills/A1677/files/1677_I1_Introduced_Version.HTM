election; and in the case of a type II district having a board of school
estimate, when the amount necessary to be provided therefor shall have been

school, as determined by the Commissioner of Education; (2) the portion of the
building to be used as a school meets regulations of the Department of

commissioner shall approve the agreement only upon a demonstration by the
district that the lease purchase payments and any operating expenses related to
the agreement can be included within the district's tax levy growth limitation
and will not result in the need for approval by the voters or board of school
estimate, as appropriate, of additional spending proposals to maintain existing
instructional programs and extracurricular activities.  If the commissioner
cannot approve the agreement, the board of education may frame a separate question
to authorize the lease purchase agreement and obtain voter or board of school

board of education as lessee the option of purchasing the leased equipment or
improvements or additions to existing school buildings during or upon
termination of the lease, with credit toward the purchase price of all or part
of rental payments which have been made by the board of education in accordance
with the lease.  As part of such a transaction, the board of education may
transfer or lease land or rights in land, including any building thereon, after
publicly advertising for proposals for the transfer for nominal or fair market
value, to the party selected by the board of education, by negotiation or
otherwise, after determining that the proposal is in the best interest of the
taxpayers of the district, to construct or to improve and to lease or to own or
to have ownership interests in the site and the school building to be leased
pursuant to such lease purchase agreement, notwithstanding the provisions of
any other law to the contrary.  The land and any building thereon which is
described in a lease purchase agreement entered into pursuant to this
amendatory act, shall be deemed to be and treated as property of the school
district, used for school purposes pursuant to R.S.54:4-3.3, and shall not be
considered or treated as property leased to another whose property is not
exempt, and shall not be assessed as real estate pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.1949, c.177 (C.54:4-2.3).  Any lease purchase agreement authorized by this
section shall contain a provision making payments thereunder subject to the
annual appropriation of funds sufficient to meet the required payments or shall
contain an annual cancellation clause and shall require all construction
contracts let by public school districts or let by developers or owners of

facilities or with other government aggregators; and a government aggregator
that is a county or municipality may contract for the provision of electric
generation service or gas supply service, either separately or bundled, for the
business and residential customers within the territorial jurisdiction of the
government aggregator.  Such a government aggregator may combine the need for

shall preclude the State government or any State independent authority or State
college from exercising authority to obtain electric generation service,
electric related service, gas supply service or gas related service, either
separately or bundled, for its own facilities on an aggregated basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Nothing in this section

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law a school
district may utilize competitive contracting in lieu of public bidding for the
procurement of certain listed specialized goods and services that exceed the

competitive contracting for the purchase of electric school buses, on-site
charging infrastructure for electric school buses, and on-site or off-site
related electric school bus and charging infrastructure operation and
maintenance services, or any combination thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law permits a school
district to enter into a contract for the leasing of school buses for a term
not exceeding in the aggregate 10 years.  The bill provides that a school
district may enter into a contract for the leasing of electric school buses and
related charging equipment and services for a term not in excess of the service
life of the electric school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year
contract term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Also under existing law, a
school district may enter into a lease purchase agreement for the acquisition
of a school bus for a term not in excess of 10 years.  This bill extends the
term of a lease purchase agreement in the case of electric school buses and
related charging equipment and services to the service life of the electric
school bus.  The bill also clarifies that the 10-year lease purchase agreement
term limit continues to apply to fossil fuel school buses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill amends the
Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et
al), to provide that the New Jersey School Boards Association may serve as a
government aggregator to obtain electric school buses and related goods and

services either individually or in combination. </p>
