Prior to the board considering an application submitted by a developer for a project restricted under subparagraph (g) of this paragraph, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury whether the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the developer.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that all factual assertions made in the developer's application are true under the penalty of perjury.  If at any time the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the award of credits and the authority shall recapture any tax credits awarded to the developer. (4)   A developer may apply to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and the chief executive officer of the authority for a tax credit transfer certificate, if the developer is awarded a tax credit pursuant to paragraph (2) or paragraph (3) of this subsection, covering one or more years, in lieu of the developer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the developer.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part, to any other person who may have a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.  The certificate provided to the developer shall include a statement waiving the developer's right to claim that amount of the credit against the taxes that the developer has elected to sell or assign.  The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this paragraph shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the developer of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value that may be permitted.  Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions that apply to the use of the credit by the developer who originally applied for and was allowed the credit. c.     All administrative costs associated with the incentive grant shall be assessed to the applicant and be retained by the State Treasurer from the annual incentive grant payments. d.    The incremental revenue for the revenues listed in subsection a. of this section shall be calculated as the difference between the amount collected in any fiscal year from any eligible revenue source included in the State redevelopment incentive grant agreement, less the revenue increment base for that eligible revenue. e.     The municipality is authorized to collect any information necessary to facilitate grants under this program and remit that information in order to assist in the calculation of incremental revenue. (cf: P.L.2022, c.75, s.2) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2022, c.75 (C.52:27D-489i1) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Notwithstanding any provision of the "New Jersey Economic Stimulus Act of 2009," P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.) to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to a mixed use parking project that is restricted under categories (vi) or (viii) of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (3) of subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-489f) and undertaken by a municipal redeveloper after the effective date of P.L.2022, c.75 (C.52:27D-489i1 et al.), for which a redevelopment incentive grant is awarded: a.     A municipal redeveloper shall submit a temporary certificate of occupancy for such proposed mixed use parking project no later than June 30, [2026] 2028. b.    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a redevelopment incentive grant award shall be equal to 100 percent of the total project costs allocated to the parking component of the project and 40 percent of the total project costs allocated to the non-parking component of a proposed mixed use parking project. (2)   A redevelopment incentive grant award shall be equal to 100 percent of the total project costs allocated to the parking component of the project and 80 percent of the total project costs allocated to the non-parking component of the mixed use parking project if the mixed use parking project is: (a)   constructed upon all or a portion of a project site that was previously the subject of an award of tax credits pursuant to the "Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit Act," P.L.2007, c. 346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) or the "New Jersey Economic Stimulus Act of 2009," P.L.2009, c. 90 (C.52:27D-489a et al.), but the tax credits were not issued; (b)   an entertainment venue with seating capacity in excess of 5,000; or (c)   constructed to be utilized by a visitor center or youth center within or adjacent to a national historic park. c.     The terms of any approval, granted by the authority, for a proposed mixed use parking project undertaken by a municipal redeveloper, which has not yet commenced construction activities other than demolition or site work, may be modified to reflect the terms established pursuant to P.L.2022, c.75 (C.52:27D-489i1 et al.), upon application to the authority for review and approval; provided, however, the developer shall not be required to pay any fee that may be established under law or regulation related to the application for modification.  All dates of required action by a municipal redeveloper contained in an approval, granted by the authority, shall be automatically extended by the thirty-month period corresponding to the temporary certificate of occupancy submission date established by subsection a. of this section. d.    All proposed mixed use parking projects shall comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, to the extent that the United States Green Building Council shall have promulgated standards for the project type proposed. (cf: P.L.2022, c.75, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately.
