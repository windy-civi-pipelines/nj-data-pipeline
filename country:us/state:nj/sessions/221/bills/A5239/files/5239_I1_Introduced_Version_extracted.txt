Under the bill, a State voters guide must be distributed by the Secretary of State no later than 45 days prior to a primary or general election to every residence wherein a registered voter resides whenever at least one Statewide elective office is scheduled to appear on the primary or general election ballot.  The format and layout of the State voters guide will be determined by the Secretary of State. The bill provides that the voters guide must also be provided in electronic form.  The bill also provides the minimum requirements for information contained in the voters guide, including minimum requirements for information regarding public questions. The Secretary of State will develop guidelines and procedures for the submission of candidate statements and photographs for inclusion in the voters guide.  The deadline for submission must be at least 11 days after the nominating petition deadlines established by law.  Candidate statements cannot include the name of any person or incorporated association of New Jersey unless their written consent is filed with the statement. Whenever a county clerk elects to publish and distribute a local voters guide, the bill requires that the guide comply with the provisions of this bill regarding the State voters guide. The bill also provides that, whenever applicable, the county clerk must send, by mail or electronically, the State and local voters guides to any military service or overseas voter registered in the jurisdiction who has requested them. Any person who publishes or distributes any campaign material that is substantively similar to a voters guide that obstructs or suppresses, or intends to obstruct or suppress, a person from exercising the right to vote will be liable to: (1) a civil penalty of not less than $5 for each copy of the substantively similar material distributed, or $10,000, whichever is greater, and (2) any legal expenses and additional costs resulting from the violation incurred by the State.
