Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.    Child and adolescent obesity has reached epidemic levels in the United States and poor diet combined with the lack of physical activity negatively impacts students health and their ability and motivation to learn. b.    In New Jersey, the current obesity rate for children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 is 14.8 percent, which is the 28th highest child and adolescent obesity rate in the nation. c.    Over the past 15 years, policymakers have taken significant steps to implement new approaches through the National School Lunch Program and federal School Breakfast Program in order to address child and adolescent obesity. d.    Federally subsided meal programs, which include the National School Lunch and federal School Breakfast Program, are required to have nutrition standards that meet specific dietary guidelines.
