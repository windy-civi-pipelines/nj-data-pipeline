The SDA provides grant funding to non-SDA districts, also known as regular operating school districts. These grants, referred to as section 15 grants, are provided to address health and safety issues and other critical needs.  Under this bill, the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf would be eligible to apply for a one-time section 15 grant.
