For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the board is hereby allocated within the Department of Transportation, but, notwithstanding that allocation, the board shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department or by any body or officer thereof. The board is hereby constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The board shall be comprised of nine public members with experience in transportation finance and policy. The Governor shall appoint three of the members with the advice and consent of the Senate, two of whom shall be experts that perform academic research in the areas of transportation and public transportation policy, planning, or engineering, and one of whom shall be an expert in the area of transportation capital finance.

If the capital program and its financing are found to be in compliance, the first annual certification required by this paragraph shall be submitted by February 1, 2008, after the certification is concurred with by the members of the authority, and by February 1 of each year thereafter. The board shall advise the commissioner and the authority on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the authority is not in compliance with the bonding requirements as provided in certification standard a. of the section, and that a corrective action plan is needed. The authority shall submit a corrective action plan that would reduce its future bond sales to offset the amount of excess bonding or to reduce future debt service payments, or both, as the case may be. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, the certification shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program. The board shall advise the commissioner on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the Department of Transportation has exceeded the limitation for the amount of authority funds spent on permitted maintenance pursuant to certification standard b. of this section, or for the amount authorized to be appropriated for project costs pursuant to certification standard c. of this section and that a corrective action plan is needed. The department shall submit a corrective action plan that would offset the excess amount spent, or the excess amount appropriated, in the prior year with less funding for permitted maintenance or for projects, as the case may be, in the proposed capital budget request. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, a certification as to these matters shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.57, s.14) 8.    (New section)  a.  In addition to the registration fees imposed pursuant to Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes: (1) beginning July 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2025, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $250 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (2) beginning July 1, 2025 and ending June 30, 2026, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $260 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (3) beginning July 1, 2026 and ending June 30, 2027, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $270 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (4) beginning July 1, 2027 and ending June 30, 2028, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $280 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; and (5) beginning July 1, 2028, and for each year thereafter, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $290 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered. b.    The fee established pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall accrue and shall be collectible upon each zero emission vehicle under the same circumstances and shall be payable in the same manner and times as apply to vehicle registrations under the provisions of Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes; provided, the fee shall be paid in full for the then current year at the time any zero emission vehicle is first registered in a calendar year. c.     Fees collected pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be credited to the "Transportation Trust Fund Account," established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20), in accordance with the provisions of subsection e. of section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20). d.    As used in this section, "zero emission vehicle" means a vehicle certified as a zero emission vehicle pursuant to the California Air Resources Board zero emission vehicle standards for the applicable model year, but shall not include any other type of vehicle that may be delivered by a manufacturer for sale or lease to satisfy the zero emission vehicle requirement established by the California Air Resources Board in lieu of a vehicle that qualifies as a pure zero emission vehicle. 9.    Section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) is repealed. 10.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority Act of 1984 to make changes necessary to support the States Annual Transportation Capital Program for Fiscal Years 2025 through 2029.  These changes also revise the rate of tax imposed on highway fuels under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax and establish an additional annual fee for zero emission vehicles from which all revenues would be dedicated to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). Transportation Trust Fund Authority Renewal The bill extends and increases the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authoritys (authority) existing authorization to issue transportation program bonds.  Under current law, the authority is authorized to issue such transportation program bonds as are necessary to fund the Annual Transportation Capital Program, in an amount not to exceed $12 billion, through June 30, 2024.  The bill extends this authorization through June 30, 2029 and increases the authoritys existing aggregate bonding capacity to $15.6 billion. The bill authorizes $10.367 billion in capital program expenditures for a five-year period from Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029.  Specifically, this bill allows for an average annual capital program size of $2 billion from Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029.  However, during Fiscal Years 2027, 2028, and 2029, the bill requires certain amounts appropriated in excess of $2 billion to be allocated to counties, municipalities, the Department of Transportation, and the New Jersey Transit Corporation for transportation projects. Under current law, the authority is required to count premiums, and not bond discounts, against its authorized bonding capacity for transportation program bonds.  This bill provides that for Fiscal Year 2016 and thereafter, any net premiums received by the authority in connection with the issuance of transportation program bonds are to be counted against the authoritys authorized bonding capacity.  This change allows the authority to account for the value of remaining bond premiums after subtracting the value of bond discounts in blended bond issuances when adjusting its bonding capacity after issuing transportation program bonds. Revision to Rate-Setting Procedure for Determining PPGRT Rate Under current law, the rate of tax imposed under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT) is annually adjusted by the State Treasurer to ensure that the State realizes a statutorily prescribed revenue target, more commonly referred to as the highway fuel cap, based on 2016 collections of highway fuel taxes.  The cap amount is based on the Fiscal Year 2016 sum of:  (1) the taxes collected on the 12.48 percent and four cent tax rates for highway fuels taxes, (2) the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the four cent motor fuel tax, and (3) the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the motor fuel tax at a rate of 23 cents per gallon.  All revenues collected are deposited into the TTF to support transportation infrastructure projects and debt service on transportation bonds.  This annual adjustment mechanism is currently set to expire at the conclusion of State Fiscal Year 2026. The bill would modify this mechanism, beginning with Fiscal Year 2025, to gradually raise the highway fuel cap amount through Fiscal Year 2029.  The amount of revenue required to be collected on highway fuel would be as follows:  $2,032,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2025; $2,115,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2026; $2,199,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2027; $2,282,000,000 in Fiscal year 2028; and $2,366,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2029.  If the actual revenues generated fall above or below the highway fuel cap amount set for the fiscal year, the rate of tax would be adjusted accordingly to ensure the highway fuel cap amount is realized. The bill also provides that after the State Treasurer has determined the rate of tax pursuant to the bill, the new rate would take effect on January 1 of Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029 rather than October 1, as is done under current law. Abolishment of the Review Council The bill would also abolish the three-member review council tasked with monitoring the implementation of the PPGRT.  The review council is currently composed of the State Treasurer, the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, and a public member jointly selected by the other two members.  Under current law, following any legislative action that halts, delays, or reverses implementation of changes to the PPGRT as enacted in 2016, the review council is required to certify whether the scheduled implementation of the 2016 changes to the tax have been impeded. Additional Fee for Zero Emission Vehicles The bill also institutes an additional fee for zero emission vehicles registered in the State.  The fee would be collected by the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission at the same time the vehicle is initially registered or renewed, as the case may be.  Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of the fee would be $250 and increase by $10 on July 1 of each year until 2028.  After that time, the amount of the fee would be set at $290. A zero emission vehicle is defined under the bill as a vehicle certified by the California Air Resources Board or a vehicle that satisfies zero emission vehicle standards for the applicable model year.  Vehicles that are produced in lieu of satisfying zero emission vehicle requirements would not be subject to the additional fee. These additional fees would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to support transportation projects. However, the bill specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF.

Transportation program bonds authorized to be issued for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2012 may be issued prior to July 1, 2012. Commencing on the day that Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of 2015, a constitutional amendment to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 4 of the New Jersey Constitution, takes effect, and ending June 30, [2024] 2029, the authority shall not issue transportation program bonds in excess of [$12,000,000,000] $15,600,000,000. Any increase in this limitation shall only occur if so provided for by law.

For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the board is hereby allocated within the Department of Transportation, but, notwithstanding that allocation, the board shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department or by any body or officer thereof. The board is hereby constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the board of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. The board shall be comprised of nine public members with experience in transportation finance and policy. The Governor shall appoint three of the members with the advice and consent of the Senate, two of whom shall be experts that perform academic research in the areas of transportation and public transportation policy, planning, or engineering, and one of whom shall be an expert in the area of transportation capital finance. The remaining members shall be appointed by the Governor as follows: two upon the recommendation of the President of the Senate, one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the Senate, two upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the General Assembly, and one upon the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the General Assembly.

The standards are: a. The bonding limitation as provided in subsection i. of section 9 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-9). b. For the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2007, the amount expended from the revenues and other funds of the authority for permitted maintenance shall not exceed the amount expended for permitted maintenance in the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2006. c. The total amount authorized to be appropriated from the revenues and other funds of the authority for project costs commencing with the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 through the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2015 shall not exceed $1,600,000,000 annually, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2016 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2023 shall not exceed an aggregate $16,000,000,000 over that eight-year period, and for the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2024 through the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2028 shall not exceed an aggregate $10,367,000,000 over that five-year period.

The certifications shall be based on the board's review of the State's fiscal year final expenditures from the preceding fiscal year, including bonding and expenditures from the annual independent audit of the authority, and the amount of authority funds programmed for permitted maintenance. If the capital program and its financing are found to be in compliance, the first annual certification required by this paragraph shall be submitted by February 1, 2008, after the certification is concurred with by the members of the authority, and by February 1 of each year thereafter. The board shall advise the commissioner and the authority on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the authority is not in compliance with the bonding requirements as provided in certification standard a. of the section, and that a corrective action plan is needed. The authority shall submit a corrective action plan that would reduce its future bond sales to offset the amount of excess bonding or to reduce future debt service payments, or both, as the case may be. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, the certification shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program. The board shall advise the commissioner on February 1, 2008 and on each succeeding February 1, if the board finds that the Department of Transportation has exceeded the limitation for the amount of authority funds spent on permitted maintenance pursuant to certification standard b. of this section, or for the amount authorized to be appropriated for project costs pursuant to certification standard c. of this section and that a corrective action plan is needed. The department shall submit a corrective action plan that would offset the excess amount spent, or the excess amount appropriated, in the prior year with less funding for permitted maintenance or for projects, as the case may be, in the proposed capital budget request. Upon approval of the corrective action plan by the board, a certification as to these matters shall be issued with certain conditions. The Annual Transportation Capital Program submitted to the Legislature for the forthcoming year shall be in compliance with the provisions of the corrective action plan. If the board does not approve the corrective action plan, the authority shall submit a financial plan showing bonding only for existing projects, noting that no bonds shall be issued for new projects shown in the department's Annual Transportation Capital Program.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.57, s.14) 8.    (New section)  a.  In addition to the registration fees imposed pursuant to Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes: (1) beginning July 1, 2024 and ending June 30, 2025, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $250 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (2) beginning July 1, 2025 and ending June 30, 2026, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $260 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (3) beginning July 1, 2026 and ending June 30, 2027, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $270 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; (4) beginning July 1, 2027 and ending June 30, 2028, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $280 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered; and (5) beginning July 1, 2028, and for each year thereafter, the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission shall impose and collect an additional annual fee of $290 upon every zero emission vehicle to be registered. b.    The fee established pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall accrue and shall be collectible upon each zero emission vehicle under the same circumstances and shall be payable in the same manner and times as apply to vehicle registrations under the provisions of Article 2 of chapter 3 of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes; provided, the fee shall be paid in full for the then current year at the time any zero emission vehicle is first registered in a calendar year. c.     Fees collected pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be credited to the "Transportation Trust Fund Account," established pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20), in accordance with the provisions of subsection e. of section 20 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-20). d.    As used in this section, "zero emission vehicle" means a vehicle certified as a zero emission vehicle pursuant to the California Air Resources Board zero emission vehicle standards for the applicable model year, but shall not include any other type of vehicle that may be delivered by a manufacturer for sale or lease to satisfy the zero emission vehicle requirement established by the California Air Resources Board in lieu of a vehicle that qualifies as a pure zero emission vehicle. 9.    Section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) is repealed. 10.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authority Act of 1984 to make changes necessary to support the States Annual Transportation Capital Program for Fiscal Years 2025 through 2029.  These changes also revise the rate of tax imposed on highway fuels under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax and establish an additional annual fee for zero emission vehicles from which all revenues would be dedicated to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF). Transportation Trust Fund Authority Renewal The bill extends and increases the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund Authoritys (authority) existing authorization to issue transportation program bonds.  Under current law, the authority is authorized to issue such transportation program bonds as are necessary to fund the Annual Transportation Capital Program, in an amount not to exceed $12 billion, through June 30, 2024.  The bill extends this authorization through June 30, 2029 and increases the authoritys existing aggregate bonding capacity to $15.6 billion. The bill authorizes $10.367 billion in capital program expenditures for a five-year period from Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029.  Specifically, this bill allows for an average annual capital program size of $2 billion from Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029.  However, during Fiscal Years 2027, 2028, and 2029, the bill requires certain amounts appropriated in excess of $2 billion to be allocated to counties, municipalities, the Department of Transportation, and the New Jersey Transit Corporation for transportation projects. Under current law, the authority is required to count premiums, and not bond discounts, against its authorized bonding capacity for transportation program bonds.  This bill provides that for Fiscal Year 2016 and thereafter, any net premiums received by the authority in connection with the issuance of transportation program bonds are to be counted against the authoritys authorized bonding capacity.  This change allows the authority to account for the value of remaining bond premiums after subtracting the value of bond discounts in blended bond issuances when adjusting its bonding capacity after issuing transportation program bonds. Revision to Rate-Setting Procedure for Determining PPGRT Rate Under current law, the rate of tax imposed under the Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax (PPGRT) is annually adjusted by the State Treasurer to ensure that the State realizes a statutorily prescribed revenue target, more commonly referred to as the highway fuel cap, based on 2016 collections of highway fuel taxes.  The cap amount is based on the Fiscal Year 2016 sum of:  (1) the taxes collected on the 12.48 percent and four cent tax rates for highway fuels taxes, (2) the amount derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the four cent motor fuel tax, and (3) the amount that would have been derived from taxing the gallonage of highway fuel subject to the motor fuel tax at a rate of 23 cents per gallon.  All revenues collected are deposited into the TTF to support transportation infrastructure projects and debt service on transportation bonds.  This annual adjustment mechanism is currently set to expire at the conclusion of State Fiscal Year 2026. The bill would modify this mechanism, beginning with Fiscal Year 2025, to gradually raise the highway fuel cap amount through Fiscal Year 2029.  The amount of revenue required to be collected on highway fuel would be as follows:  $2,032,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2025; $2,115,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2026; $2,199,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2027; $2,282,000,000 in Fiscal year 2028; and $2,366,000,000 in Fiscal Year 2029.  If the actual revenues generated fall above or below the highway fuel cap amount set for the fiscal year, the rate of tax would be adjusted accordingly to ensure the highway fuel cap amount is realized. The bill also provides that after the State Treasurer has determined the rate of tax pursuant to the bill, the new rate would take effect on January 1 of Fiscal Year 2025 through Fiscal Year 2029 rather than October 1, as is done under current law. Abolishment of the Review Council The bill would also abolish the three-member review council tasked with monitoring the implementation of the PPGRT.  The review council is currently composed of the State Treasurer, the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, and a public member jointly selected by the other two members.  Under current law, following any legislative action that halts, delays, or reverses implementation of changes to the PPGRT as enacted in 2016, the review council is required to certify whether the scheduled implementation of the 2016 changes to the tax have been impeded. Additional Fee for Zero Emission Vehicles The bill also institutes an additional fee for zero emission vehicles registered in the State.  The fee would be collected by the Chief Administrator of the Motor Vehicle Commission at the same time the vehicle is initially registered or renewed, as the case may be.  Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount of the fee would be $250 and increase by $10 on July 1 of each year until 2028.  After that time, the amount of the fee would be set at $290. A zero emission vehicle is defined under the bill as a vehicle certified by the California Air Resources Board or a vehicle that satisfies zero emission vehicle standards for the applicable model year.  Vehicles that are produced in lieu of satisfying zero emission vehicle requirements would not be subject to the additional fee. These additional fees would be credited to the Transportation Trust Fund Account - Subaccount for Capital Reserves to support transportation projects. However, the bill specifies that these collections may not be used to pay debt service on transportation system bonds, transportation program bonds, or any other bonds, notes or other obligations, including subordinated obligations of the authority until such time as these revenues may be constitutionally dedicated to the TTF.
