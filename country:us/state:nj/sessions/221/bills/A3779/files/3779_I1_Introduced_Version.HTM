If a vacancy occurs in the office of a trustee, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner as the office was previously filled. e.     The trustees shall serve without compensation, but they shall be reimbursed by the State for all necessary expenses that they may incur through service on the board.  No employee member shall suffer loss of salary through the serving on the board. f.     Except as otherwise herein provided, no member of the board of trustees shall have any direct interest in the gains or profits of any investments of the retirement system; nor shall any member of the board of trustees directly or indirectly, for himself or as an agent in any manner use the moneys of the retirement system, except to make such current and necessary payments as are authorized by the board of trustees; nor shall any member of the board of trustees become an endorser or surety, or in any manner an obligor for moneys loaned to or borrowed from the retirement system. g.    Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote in the board.  A majority vote of all trustees shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of said board. h.    Subject to the limitations of this act, the board of trustees shall annually establish rules and regulations for the administration of the funds created by this act and for the transactions of the board's and committee's business. Such rules and regulations shall be consistent with those adopted by the other pension funds within the Division of Pensions and Benefits in order to permit the most economical and uniform administration of all such retirement systems.  The committee shall adopt such regulations as provided in subsection o. of this section. i.     The actuary of the fund shall be selected by the Retirement Systems Actuary Selection Committee established by P.L.1992, c.125.

The provisions of subsections c. through g., inclusive, of this section shall apply to the committee and its members, as appropriate.  The committee shall keep a record of all of its proceedings which shall be open to public inspection. Upon the convening of any meeting of the committee, the members shall consider a motion to assume the authority provided in this subsection and shall proceed only if a majority of the members of the committee vote in the affirmative on that motion. The committee may contract with such actuaries or consultants, or both, in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-6 et seq.), as the committee may deem necessary to perform its duties, when the system has attained the target funded ratio. When the retirement system has attained the target funded ratio as defined in section 27 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-16), the committee shall have the discretionary authority for the system to (1) modify the: member contribution rate; formula for calculation of final compensation or final salary; age at which a member may be eligible for and the benefits for service or special retirement; and benefits provided for disability retirement; and (2) activate the application of the "Pension Adjustment Act," P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-1 et seq.) for retirees for the period that the system is at or above the target funded ratio and modify the basis for the calculation of the adjustment and set the duration and extent of the activation.  The committee shall give priority consideration to subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.  The committee shall not have the authority to change the years of creditable service required for vesting. The committee may consider a matter described above and render a decision notwithstanding that the provisions of the statutory law may set forth a specific requirement on that matter. The committee may consider a matter described above and render a decision notwithstanding that the provisions of the statutory law do not set forth a specific requirement on the considered aspect of that matter or address that matter at all. The members of the committee shall have the same duty and responsibility to the retirement system as do the members of the board of trustees.  No decision of the committee shall be implemented if the direct or indirect result of the decision will be that the system's funded ratio falls below the target funded ratio in any valuation period during the 30 years following the implementation of the decision.  The actuary of the fund shall make a determination of the result in that regard and submit that determination in a written report to the committee and the board prior to the implementation of the decision. If any matter before the committee receives at least five votes in the affirmative, the board of trustees shall approve and implement the committee's decision. If any matter regarding benefits before the committee receives four votes in the affirmative and four votes in the negative or the committee otherwise reaches an impasse on a decision, the provisions of section 33 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-17) shall be followed. A final action of the committee shall be made by the adoption of a regulation that shall identify the modifications to the system by reference to statutory section.  The regulations shall also specify the effective date of the modification and the system members, including beneficiaries and retirees, to whom the modification applies.  Regulations of the committee are considered to be part of the plan document for the system.  A regulation adopted by the committee may be modified by regulation in order to comply with the requirements of this section. p.    No member of the board, committee, employee of the board, or employee of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury shall accept from any person, whether directly or indirectly and whether by himself or through his spouse or any member of his family, or through any partner or associate, any gift, favor, service, employment or offer of employment, or any other thing of value, including contributions to the campaign of a member or employee as a candidate for elective public office, which he knows or has reason to believe is offered to him with intent to influence him in the performance of his public duties and responsibilities.  As used in this subsection, "person" means an (1) individual or business entity, or officer or employee of such an entity, who is seeking, or who holds, or who held within the prior three years, a contract with the board; (2) an active or retired member, or beneficiary, of the retirement system; or (3) an entity, or officer or employee of such an entity, in which the assets of the retirement system have been invested.  A board or committee member or employee violating this prohibition shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree. (cf: P.L.2011, c.78, s.5) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill changes the membership requirements for the board of trustees of the State Police Retirement System (SPRS).  Under the bill, two members appointed by the Governor will no longer be required to be private citizens who are neither an active nor retired member of the system. The SPRS board of trustees currently consists of two active or retired members of SPRS, two private citizens appointed by the Governor, and the State Treasurer.  The board of trustees is responsible for the operations of the SPRS in accordance with current law and administrative regulations.
