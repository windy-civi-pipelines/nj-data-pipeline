the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    N.J.S.2C:36A-1 is
amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:36A-1.  Conditional
discharge for certain first offenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under section 20 of P.L.1970,
c.226 (C.24:21-20), or a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense
defined in chapter 35 or 36 of this title or, subsequent to the effective date
of this title, under any law of the United States, this State or any other
state relating to marijuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs,
and who has not<u>, except as provided in subsection e. of this section,</u>
previously participated in a program of supervisory treatment pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:43-12 or conditional dismissal pursuant to P.L.2013, c.158
(C.2C:43-13.1 et al.), or a Veterans Diversion Program pursuant to P.L.2017,
c.42 (C.2C:43-23 et al.), is charged with or convicted of any disorderly
persons offense or petty disorderly persons offense under chapter 35 or 36 of
this title, the court upon notice to the prosecutor and subject to subsection
c. of this section, may on motion of the defendant or the court:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Suspend further
proceedings and with the consent of the person after reference to the State
Bureau of Identification criminal history record information files, place him
under supervisory treatment upon such reasonable terms and conditions as it may
require; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   After a plea of guilty
or finding of guilty, and without entering a judgment of conviction, and with
the consent of the person after proper reference to the State Bureau of
Identification criminal history record information files, place him on
supervisory treatment upon reasonable terms and conditions as it may require,
or as otherwise provided by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In no event shall the
court require as a term or condition of supervisory treatment under this
section, referral to any residential treatment facility for a period exceeding
the maximum period of confinement prescribed by law for the offense for which
the individual has been charged or convicted, nor shall any term of supervisory
treatment imposed under this subsection exceed a period of three years. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon violation of a term or
condition of supervisory treatment the court may enter a judgment of conviction
and proceed as otherwise provided, or where there has been no plea of guilty or
finding of guilty, resume proceedings. Upon fulfillment of the terms and
conditions of supervisory treatment the court shall terminate the supervisory
treatment and dismiss the proceedings against him. Termination of supervisory
treatment and dismissal under this section shall be without court adjudication
of guilt and shall not be deemed a conviction for purposes of disqualifications
or disabilities, if any, imposed by law upon conviction of a crime or
disorderly persons offense but shall be reported by the clerk of the court to
the State Bureau of Identification criminal history record information files.
Termination of supervisory treatment and dismissal under this section may occur
only once with respect to any person.  Imposition of supervisory treatment
under this section shall not be deemed a conviction for the purposes of
determining whether a second or subsequent offense has occurred under section
29 of P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-29), chapter 35 or 36 of this title or any law
of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Proceedings under this
section shall not be available to any defendant unless the court in its
discretion concludes that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The defendant's
continued presence in the community, or in a civil treatment center or program,
will not pose a danger to the community; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the terms and
conditions of supervisory treatment will be adequate to protect the public and
will benefit the defendant by serving to correct any dependence on or use of
controlled substances which he may manifest; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The person has not
previously received supervisory treatment under section 27 of P.L.1970, c.226
(C.24:21-27), N.J.S.2C:43-12, or the provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A person seeking
conditional discharge pursuant to this section shall pay to the court a fee of
$75 which shall be paid to the Treasurer of the State of New Jersey for deposit
in the General Fund.  The defendant shall also be required to pay restitution,
costs and other assessments as provided by law. A person may apply for a waiver
of this fee, by reason of poverty, pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts
of the State of New Jersey, or the court may permit the defendant to pay the
conditional discharge fee and other assessments in installments or may order
other alternatives pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2009, c.317 (C.2B:12-23.1).  </p>

a Veterans Diversion Program pursuant to P.L.2017, c.42 (C.2C:43-23 et al.), shall
be eligible for supervisory treatment under this section if the previous
supervisory treatment concerned crimes or offenses involving manufacturing,
distributing, or dispensing, or possessing or having under control with intent
to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, marijuana or hashish in violation of
paragraph (12) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:35-5; or obtaining, possessing,

marijuana or hashish as described herein and a violation of N.J.S.2C:36-2 for
using or possessing with intent to use drug paraphernalia with that marijuana
or hashish, alone or in combination with each other; or any disorderly persons

that supervisory treatment should ordinarily be limited to persons who have not
previously been convicted of any criminal offense under the laws of New Jersey,
or under any criminal law of the United States, or any other state when
supervisory treatment would:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Provide applicants, on
an equal basis, with opportunities to avoid ordinary prosecution by receiving
early rehabilitative services or supervision, when such services or supervision
can reasonably be expected to deter future criminal behavior by an applicant,
and when there is apparent causal connection between the offense charged and
the rehabilitative or supervisory need, without which cause both the alleged
offense and the need to prosecute might not have occurred; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Provide an alternative
to prosecution for applicants who might be harmed by the imposition of criminal
sanctions as presently administered, when such an alternative can be expected
to serve as sufficient sanction to deter criminal conduct; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Provide a mechanism for
permitting the least burdensome form of prosecution possible for defendants
charged with &quot;victimless&quot; offenses, other than defendants who were
public officers or employees charged with offenses that involved or touched
their office or employment; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Provide assistance to
criminal calendars in order to focus expenditure of criminal justice resources
on matters involving serious criminality and severe correctional problems; or</p>

purposes of this subparagraph, a crime or offense involves violence or the
threat of violence if the victim sustains serious or significant bodily injury
as defined in subsection b. or d. of N.J.S.2C:11-1, or the actor is armed with

to challenge the decision of the prosecutor or program director not to
recommend enrollment in a program of supervisory treatment the proceedings

conducive to change through his participation in supervisory treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   The needs and interests
of the victim and society;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   The extent to which the
applicant's crime constitutes part of a continuing pattern of anti-social
behavior;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The applicant's record
of criminal and penal violations and the extent to which he may present a
substantial danger to others;</p>

is of such a nature that the value of supervisory treatment would be outweighed
by the public need for prosecution;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15) Whether or not the
applicant's involvement with other people in the crime charged or in other

eligible servicemember, or the servicemember's own legal counsel may make an
application to the prosecutor to participate in the Veterans Diversion Program. 
The prosecutor may approve or conditionally approve an eligible servicemember's
admission into the Veterans Diversion Program. An eligible servicemember may be
conditionally approved for admission into the program pending verification of
the person's veteran or servicemember status, review of the person's criminal
history, and consideration of the findings of a clinical assessment of the
person's mental health. Once admitted to the program, the prosecutor may move
before the court to postpone proceedings while an eligible servicemember
obtains a mental health assessment or participates in case management and
mental health services. The court may grant the postponement of proceedings and
release the servicemember on the persons' own recognizance subject to
compliance with the conditions specified in the prosecutor's diversion
agreement.  If the prosecutor's review of the person's records and the clinical
assessment reveals that the person does not qualify for the program or if the
servicemember does not comply with the requirements of the diversion agreement,
the prosecutor may notify the court that the State is prepared to proceed with
the prosecution of the offense and the court shall schedule court proceedings
as appropriate.</p>

(C.2C:43-23 et al.) after consideration of the nature of the eligible offense,
the causative relationship between the person's diagnosed or apparent mental
illness and the commission of the offense, the amenability of the servicemember
to participation in the services of the program, the availability of case
management and mental health services, the desires of any victim, the person's
history of prior convictions, and the probability that diversion will promote
the servicemember's recovery, prevent future criminal behavior, and protect public
safety. A prosecutor may also consider and approve other diversion alternatives

previously arrested for certain marijuana offenses who participated in
conditional discharge, supervisory treatment, or another diversion program for
first offenders would be eligible to participate in a diversion program again
if participation in the program the first time was for a marijuana offense that
is no longer unlawful. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>RECENT ENACTMENTS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2021, c.19, enacted
February 22, 2021, decriminalized the possession of up to six ounces of
marijuana, or up to 170 grams of hashish.  The enactment provides that there
are no criminal or civil penalties for such possession. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The enactment also
decriminalized a first offense of manufacturing, distributing, or possessing
with intent to distribute one ounce or less of marijuana, or five grams or less
of hashish.  A first offender is subject to a written warning, which also
indicates that a subsequent offense of manufacturing, distributing, or
possessing with intent to distribute this amount of marijuana or hashish
constitutes a crime of the fourth degree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     P.L.2021, c.16, also enacted
February 22, 2021, legalized the manufacture, purchase, and sale of regulated
cannabis. The enactment also established the Cannabis Regulatory Commission.
Under P.L.2021, c.16, regulated cannabis will be lawful in this State when the
commission promulgates regulations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>ATTORNEY GENERAL DIRECTIVE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In light of the enactment of
P.L.2021, c.16 and c.19, the New Jersey Attorney General issued Directive No.
2021-1 on  February 22, 2021. It directed all prosecutors in the State to
dismiss any pending marijuana cases where the underlying offense had been
legalized. The directive further indicated that the Administrative Office of
the Courts would vacate by operation of law any guilty verdict, plea, placement
in a diversionary program, or other entry of guilt on a matter where the
conduct occurred prior to February 22, 2021. Also vacated would be any
conviction, remaining sentence, ongoing supervision, or unpaid court-ordered
financial assessment of any person serving a sentence of incarceration,
probation, parole or other form of community supervision as a result of the
persons conviction for the offenses that had been legalized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>DIVERSIONARY PROGRAMS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill applies to the
following diversionary programs:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     --- Conditional discharge,
N.J.S.A.2C:36A-1;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     --- Pretrial Intervention
(PTI), N.J.S.A.2C:43-12;</p>

municipal court, N.J.S.A.2C:43-13.1 et al.; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     --- The Veterans Diversion
Program, N.J.S.A.2C:43-23 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, these
programs require that the person wishing to participate not have been a
previous participant in that particular program or in another diversionary
program.  Under the bill, previous participation in a diversionary program
would no longer bar participation on a second occasion if the first
participation was for a marijuana or hashish offense that was subsequently
decriminalized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>EFFECTIVE DATE</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would take effect on

2021, the effective date of P.L.2021, c.19.</p>
