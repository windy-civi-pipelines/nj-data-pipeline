<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill reinstates the
criminal penalty for underage possession and consumption of alcoholic
beverages, cannabis, marijuana, and hashish as a disorderly person offense.  A
disorderly person offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment for up to six
months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.  This bill also re-establishes a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The New Jersey Cannabis
Regulatory, Enforcement, Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act
(CREAMMA), P.L.2021, c.16, established a penalty for underage possession and
consumption of cannabis and marijuana equivalent to the penalty for underage
alcohol.  Shortly after CREAMMA was enacted, the criminal penalties for underage
alcohol and cannabis were replaced with a system of non-punitive written
warnings, under P.L.2021, c.25, and P.L.2021, c.38.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors view that
the written warning scheme has proven ineffectual in curbing underage use and
abuse of alcohol and cannabis, as demonstrated by a sharp rise in 2022 and 2023
in the number of police complaints regarding underage parties where alcohol and
cannabis were found, particularly in the beach communities along the Jersey
Shore.  It is the sponsors intent to control underage alcohol and cannabis use
and abuse by reinstating the threat of criminal prosecution, as well as
drivers license suspension.</p>
