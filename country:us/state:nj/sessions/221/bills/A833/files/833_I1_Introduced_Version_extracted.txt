The underage person who received medical assistance also shall be immune from prosecution under this section. g.    For purposes of this section, an alcoholic beverage includes powdered alcohol as defined by R.S.33:1-1, a cannabis item includes any item available for lawful consumption pursuant to the "New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act," P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.), and the terms "marijuana" and "hashish" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:35-2, and the terms "drug paraphernalia" and "cannabis paraphernalia" have the same meaning as set forth in N.J.S.2C:36-1 and section 3 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-33), respectively. h.    Whenever an offense under this section is committed in a motor vehicle, the court shall, in addition to the sentence authorized for the offense, suspend or postpone for six months the driving privilege of the defendant.  Upon the conviction of any person under this section, the court shall forward a report to the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission stating the first and last day of the suspension or postponement period imposed by the court pursuant to this section.  If a person at the time of the imposition of a sentence is less than 17 years of age, the period of license postponement, including a suspension or postponement of the privilege of operating a motorized bicycle, shall commence on the day the sentence is imposed and shall run for a period of six months after the person reaches the age of 17 years. If a person at the time of the imposition of a sentence has a valid drivers license issued by this State, the court shall immediately collect the license and forward it to the commission along with the report.  If for any reason the license cannot be collected, the court shall include in the report the complete name, address, date of birth, eye color, and sex of the person as well as the first and last date of the license suspension period imposed by the court. The court shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person is convicted of operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension or postponement, the person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in R.S.39:3-40.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the written notice in writing. Failure to receive a written notice or failure to acknowledge in writing the receipt of a written notice shall not be a defense to a subsequent charge of a violation of R.S.39:3-40. If the person convicted under this section is not a New Jersey resident, the court shall suspend or postpone, as appropriate, the non-resident driving privilege of the person based on the age of the person and submit to the commission the required report.  The court shall not collect the license of a non-resident convicted under this section.  Upon receipt of a report by the court, the commission shall notify the appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction of the suspension or postponement. i.     In addition to the general penalty prescribed for a disorderly persons offense, the court may require any person who violates this act to participate in an alcohol or drug abuse education or treatment program, authorized by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services, for a period not to exceed the maximum period of confinement prescribed by law for the offense for which the individual has been convicted. (cf: P.L.2021, c.447, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reinstates the criminal penalty for underage possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages, cannabis, marijuana, and hashish as a disorderly person offense.  A disorderly person offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment for up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.  This bill also re-establishes a minimum fine of $500 and re-establishes the penalty of a six month suspension of driving privileges. The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement, Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), P.L.2021, c.16, established a penalty for underage possession and consumption of cannabis and marijuana equivalent to the penalty for underage alcohol.  Shortly after CREAMMA was enacted, the criminal penalties for underage alcohol and cannabis were replaced with a system of non-punitive written warnings, under P.L.2021, c.25, and P.L.2021, c.38. It is the sponsors view that the written warning scheme has proven ineffectual in curbing underage use and abuse of alcohol and cannabis, as demonstrated by a sharp rise in 2022 and 2023 in the number of police complaints regarding underage parties where alcohol and cannabis were found, particularly in the beach communities along the Jersey Shore.  It is the sponsors intent to control underage alcohol and cannabis use and abuse by reinstating the threat of criminal prosecution, as well as drivers license suspension.

If a person at the time of the imposition of a sentence has a valid drivers license issued by this State, the court shall immediately collect the license and forward it to the commission along with the report.  If for any reason the license cannot be collected, the court shall include in the report the complete name, address, date of birth, eye color, and sex of the person as well as the first and last date of the license suspension period imposed by the court. The court shall inform the person orally and in writing that if the person is convicted of operating a motor vehicle during the period of license suspension or postponement, the person shall be subject to the penalties set forth in R.S.39:3-40.  A person shall be required to acknowledge receipt of the written notice in writing.

If the person convicted under this section is not a New Jersey resident, the court shall suspend or postpone, as appropriate, the non-resident driving privilege of the person based on the age of the person and submit to the commission the required report.  The court shall not collect the license of a non-resident convicted under this section.  Upon receipt of a report by the court, the commission shall notify the appropriate officials in the licensing jurisdiction of the suspension or postponement. i.     In addition to the general penalty prescribed for a disorderly persons offense, the court may require any person who violates this act to participate in an alcohol or drug abuse education or treatment program, authorized by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services, for a period not to exceed the maximum period of confinement prescribed by law for the offense for which the individual has been convicted. (cf: P.L.2021, c.447, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reinstates the criminal penalty for underage possession and consumption of alcoholic beverages, cannabis, marijuana, and hashish as a disorderly person offense.  A disorderly person offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment for up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.  This bill also re-establishes a minimum fine of $500 and re-establishes the penalty of a six month suspension of driving privileges. The New Jersey Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement, Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act (CREAMMA), P.L.2021, c.16, established a penalty for underage possession and consumption of cannabis and marijuana equivalent to the penalty for underage alcohol.  Shortly after CREAMMA was enacted, the criminal penalties for underage alcohol and cannabis were replaced with a system of non-punitive written warnings, under P.L.2021, c.25, and P.L.2021, c.38. It is the sponsors view that the written warning scheme has proven ineffectual in curbing underage use and abuse of alcohol and cannabis, as demonstrated by a sharp rise in 2022 and 2023 in the number of police complaints regarding underage parties where alcohol and cannabis were found, particularly in the beach communities along the Jersey Shore.  It is the sponsors intent to control underage alcohol and cannabis use and abuse by reinstating the threat of criminal prosecution, as well as drivers license suspension.
