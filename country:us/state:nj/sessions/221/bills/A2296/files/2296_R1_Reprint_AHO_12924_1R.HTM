all State funds appropriated for affordable housing purposes, including, but
not limited to, the proceeds from the receipts of the additional fee collected
pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49

housing elements have received substantive certification from the council, in
municipalities receiving State aid pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et
