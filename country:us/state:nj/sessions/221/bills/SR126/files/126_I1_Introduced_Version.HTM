SR126 SENATE RESOLUTION No. 126 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 3, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  TROY SINGLETON District 7 (Burlington) Senator  NICHOLAS P. SCUTARI District 22 (Somerset and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Cryan and Vitale SYNOPSIS Condemns U.S. House of Representatives for passage of budget resolution cutting $1.5 trillion from federal budget and urges U.S. Senate to reject House resolution. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Senate Resolution condemning U.S. House of Representatives for passage of budget resolution cutting $1.5 trillion from federal budget and urging U.S. Senate to reject House resolution. Whereas, On February 25, 2025, the United States House of Representatives passed a budget resolution seeking to cut a minimum of $1.5 trillion over ten years from the federal budget; and Whereas, The budget resolution specifically targets $880 billion in cuts from the House Energy and Commerce Committee which regulates public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, $330 billion from the Education and Workforce Committee which routinely legislates matters on education funding, and $230 billion from the Agriculture Committee whose purview includes the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); and Whereas, Given the size and scope of the desired funding cuts, as well as budget documents circulated by House leadership, policy experts believe that these cuts are aimed at or will ultimately fall on critical safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP; and Whereas, In New Jersey, approximately 1.8 million low- and moderate-income people rely on NJ FamilyCare, which  encompasses the State Medicaid program and the Childrens Health Insurance Program, to cover their healthcare needs; and Whereas, According to estimates provided by the Department of Human Services (DHS), which administers NJ FamilyCare, the House budget resolution could reduce federal matching funds for NJ FamilyCare by up to $5.2 billion, nearly 22 percent of the programs current budget; and Whereas, The DHS further projects that proposed restrictions on existing healthcare funding streams, such as provider taxes and directed payments, would put an additional $4.2 billion in Medicaid funding at risk; and Whereas, Funding reductions of this size would have severe consequences for the State residents who rely on NJ FamilyCare for healthcare, as well as the provider community who deliver these critical services; and Whereas, The DHS warns that the States hospital systems alone could lose up to $4.9 billion in Medicaid funding under the various proposals circulating to achieve the House budget resolution reductions; and Whereas, Approximately 830,000 low-income residents in New Jersey receive SNAP benefits, which provides them with the resources needed to feed their families; and Whereas, It is anticipated that federal funding cuts to SNAP under the House budget resolution would be realized by limiting benefits, restricting eligibility, or some combination of both of these actions; thereby significantly reducing the number of residents in the State who receive support from this program; and Whereas, As inflation and the impact of bird flu cause food prices to rise, the people of New Jersey rely on essential SNAP benefits to remain food secure; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper for the Senate to defend the States most vulnerable residents from these drastic federal funding reductions by condemning the U.S. House of Representatives for their actions and urging the U.S. Senate to reject this funding proposal; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House condemns the United States House of Representatives for passage of a budget resolution, on February 25, 2025, cutting $1.5 trillion from the federal budget over ten years and respectfully urges the United States Senate to reject this House resolution. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and every member of the United States Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This Senate Resolution condemns the United States House of Representatives for passage of a budget resolution, on February 25, 2025, cutting $1.5 trillion over ten years from the federal budget and respectfully urges the United States Senate to reject this House resolution.  The budget resolution specifically targets $880 billion in cuts from the House Energy and Commerce Committee which regulates public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, $330 billion from the Education and Workforce Committee which routinely legislates matters on education funding, and $230 billion from the Agriculture Committee whose purview includes the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  Given the size and scope of the desired cuts, as well as budget documents circulated by House leadership, policy experts believe that these cuts are aimed at or will ultimately fall on critical safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP. In New Jersey, approximately 1.8 million low- and moderate- income people rely on NJ FamilyCare, which encompasses the Medicaid Program and the Childrens Health Insurance Program, to cover their healthcare needs.  Funding reductions of this size would have severe consequences for these enrollees, as well as the provider community who deliver the critical healthcare services under the program. Approximately 830,000 low-income residents in New Jersey receive SNAP benefits, which provides them with the resources needed to feed their families.  It is anticipated that federal funding cuts to SNAP under the House budget resolution would be realized by limiting benefits, restricting eligibility, or some combination of both of these actions; thereby, significantly reducing the number of residents who receive support from this program.
