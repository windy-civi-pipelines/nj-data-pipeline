<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, designated as the
Road to Tax Relief Act, provides various forms of tax relief to certain
businesses and employees who are adversely impacted by a public highway
project, such as the ongoing repair of Interstate 80 in Morris County after the
discovery of numerous sinkholes and voids along the roadway. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, a retail
business establishment that operates within an impacted construction zone would
be entitled to claim a refundable credit against the remittance required under
the Sales and Use Tax Act, P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) in the amount of
taxes collected at the establishment during each month in which the public
highway project remains ongoing, less the portion of the tax that is
constitutionally dedicated to the Property Tax Relief Fund.  To claim the
credit, the retail business establishment would be required to submit an
application to the Director of the Division of Taxation (director) to verify
that the retail business establishment operates within an impacted construction
zone.  Upon approval of the application, the retail business establishment
would be permitted to claim a refundable credit against the requirement to
remit any tax collections for which the credit is claimed, subject to the
appropriation of funds for this purpose.  The bill also appropriates such
amounts as are necessary to defray the costs of the credits against sales tax
remittances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an impacted
construction zone is defined as any area immediately surrounding a public
highway project within which area the occurrence of the public highway project
impedes or blocks the normal and reasonable flow of traffic or otherwise
restricts access to business establishments located within the area.  The bill
also defines a retail business establishment to include any small business,
with no more than 50 full-time employees, that maintains a fixed permanent
location where goods are exhibited or services are offered on an appointment or
walk-in basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides gross income tax and corporate income tax credits to retail business
establishments operating within an impacted construction zone in the amount of
the revenue losses experienced by the establishment as a result of the public
highway project.  To claim the credit, the retail business establishment would
be required to apply to the director for a certification of the establishments
revenue loss for the applicable tax period.  Under the bill, the retail
business establishments revenue loss would be calculated based on the
difference between: (1) the baseline receipts, which include the average sum
of the actual receipts, in dollars, received in compensation for goods and
services sold at the establishment during the dates comprising the applicable
relief period in the four prior years; and (2) the actual receipts, which
include the sum of the actual receipts, in dollars, received in compensation
for goods and services sold at a retail business establishment located within
an impacted construction zone during the relief period.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After approval of the
certificate of revenue loss, the retail business establishment would be
permitted to claim the tax credit.  However, the bill also permits the retail
business establishment to apply for a tax credit transfer certificate so that
part or all of the credit awarded may be sold or assigned in the tax period
during which the tax credit transfer certificate is received.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill also provides
gross income tax credits to the employees of retail business establishments operating
within an impacted construction zone based on the amount of lost wages
experienced by the employee as a result of a modification or reduction to their
work schedule due to the impacts of a public highway project.  To claim the
credit, the employee would be required to apply to the director for a
certification of lost wages for the applicable tax period.  Under the bill, the
employees lost wages would be calculated based on the difference between: (1)
the baseline wages, which include the compensation that an employee would
have otherwise received during the relief period for services rendered at a
business establishment had the employees work schedule not been modified or
reduced as a result of the impacts of a public highway project; and (2) the
actual wages, which include the actual compensation received by an employee
during the relief period for services rendered at a business establishment.</p>
