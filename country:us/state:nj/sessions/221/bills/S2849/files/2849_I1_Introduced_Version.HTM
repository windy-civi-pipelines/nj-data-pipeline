<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
establishing the Autism Education Council and supplementing Title 18A of the
New Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the &quot;New Jersey Autism Education Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Autism spectrum
disorders, neurological disorders that cause mild to severe social,
communication and other impairments in an individual, generally appear during
the first three years of life and continue over a lifetime, resulting in
significant and long-term emotional and financial distress to both the autistic
individual and the family members who care for him;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The cost of caring for
individuals with autism spectrum disorders is tremendous, particularly since
many autistic individuals must reside in specialized settings such as group
homes throughout most of their lives.  One estimate reports that the cost of
autism in the State exceeds one billion dollars each year;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Although the exact
prevalence of autism spectrum disorders is unknown, it is estimated by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that 2
 to 6 per 1,000 children have an autism spectrum disorder.  The disorders are
four times more likely to occur in boys than in girls and are more common among
children than many better known disabilities, such as diabetes and Down
syndrome;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There is no known cure
for autism spectrum disorders although specialized educational therapies and
approaches are available that may help manage its symptoms.  It is therefore
imperative that the parents of an affected child work collaboratively with the
school district to arrange the most appropriate education for their child;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     However, a history of
inattention to autism spectrum disorders by the education community coupled
with a sharp increase in the number of new diagnoses of the condition has
resulted in a situation in which the educational needs of autistic children
greatly exceed both the range of autism education services currently available
and the capacity of the workforce that is qualified to provide them; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The parents, school
districts, and local taxpayers across the State who struggle to finance costly
education programs for autistic children would benefit from an Autism Education
Council which seeks to better develop the capacity of the autism education workforce
in this State and broaden the array of services available to students with
autism in the public schools. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Autism&quot; means
autism spectrum disorders to the extent determined by the council to be
appropriate;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Council&quot; means the
Autism Education Council created pursuant to this act.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  There is established
an Autism Education Council in, but not of, the Department of Education.  The
council shall consist of seven members including the Commissioner of Education,
or his designee, who shall serve ex officio, and six public members to be
appointed by the Governor, including two public school teachers and one
representative of each of the following organizations: Parents of Autistic
Children, The New Jersey Center for Outreach Services for the Autism Community,
The Family Resource Network, and ASPEN.  To the greatest extent practicable,
consideration shall be given to the appointment of members from these
organizations who possess some teaching experience.  The two public school
teachers appointed to the council shall have a Master's Degree in Education or
other relevant subject area, certification as a Board Certified Behavior
Analyst by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board, and a minimum of five
years' experience as a teacher. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner or his
designee shall serve as chairman of the council. The two teachers on the
council shall serve for two-year terms and all other members shall serve for
three-year terms.  Each member shall hold office for the term of appointment
and until a successor is appointed and qualified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Vacancies in the membership of
the commission shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointments
are made and a member may be eligible for reappointment.  Vacancies occurring
other than by expiration of a term shall be filled for the unexpired term.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The members of the council
shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for the reasonable
expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties within the
limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the council for its
purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The council shall
organize no later than 30 days after the appointment of its members and shall
meet periodically at the call of the chairman, but not less than six times in
each year.  A majority of the members of the council shall constitute a quorum,
but a lesser number may hold hearings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The chairman shall
appoint a salaried administrator for the council and shall provide the council
with additional administrative staff and support as may be necessary to enable
the council to carry out its functions. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:
always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    It shall be the duty of
the council to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     establish a five-member
Educational Advisory Committee whose members shall serve at the pleasure of the
council.  Three members of the committee shall be appointed by the chairman of
the council and shall include one director of special education in a public
school district and two chairpersons, coordinators, or other individuals in
charge of teacher preparation programs for special education teachers.  Two
members of the committee shall be appointed by a majority vote of the council. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The committee shall identify
and make recommendations to the council regarding the most effective use of
grant funds to improve the quality and availability of public school services
and programs for children with autism.  The committee shall identify potential
grant recipients who represent a variety of research-based approaches to
educating children with autism.</p>
