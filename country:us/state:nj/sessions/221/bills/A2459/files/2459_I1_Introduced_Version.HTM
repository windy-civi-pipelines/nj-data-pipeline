Presumption of Revocation; Brief Incarceration in Lieu of Permanent Revocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Any person who is
ineligible for probation due to a conviction for a crime which is subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole
ineligibility may be sentenced to a term of special probation in accordance
with this section, and may not apply for drug and alcohol treatment pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:45-1.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a person
who is eligible for probation in accordance with N.J.S.2C:45-1 due to a
conviction for an offense which is not subject to a presumption of
incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole ineligibility from
applying for drug or alcohol treatment as a condition of probation pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:45-1; provided, however, that a person in need of treatment as defined
in subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2) shall be
sentenced in accordance with that section.  Notwithstanding the presumption of
incarceration pursuant to the provisions of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:44-1,
whenever a drug or alcohol dependent person who is subject to sentencing under
this section is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for an offense, other
than one described in subsection b. of this section, the court, upon notice to
the prosecutor, may, on motion of the person, or on the court's own motion,
place the person on special probation, which shall be for a term of five years,
provided that the court finds on the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person has undergone
a professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person is drug or alcohol dependent and would benefit from treatment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the person is a drug or
alcohol dependent person within the meaning of N.J.S.2C:35-2 and was drug or
alcohol dependent at the time of the commission of the present offense; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the present offense was
committed while the person was under the influence of a controlled dangerous
substance, controlled substance analog or alcohol or was committed to acquire
property or monies in order to support the person's drug or alcohol dependency;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   substance use disorders
treatment and monitoring will serve to benefit the person by addressing the
person's drug or alcohol dependency and will thereby reduce the likelihood that
the person will thereafter commit another offense; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the person did not
possess a firearm at the time of the present offense and did not possess a
firearm at the time of any pending criminal charge; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   the person has not been
previously convicted on two or more separate occasions of crimes of the first
or second degree, other than those listed in paragraph (7); or the person has
not been previously convicted on two or more separate occasions, where one of
the offenses is a crime of the third degree, other than crimes defined in
N.J.S.2C:35-10, and one of the offenses is a crime of the first or second
degree; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   the person has not been
previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent for, and does not have a pending
charge of murder, aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault, or a similar crime under
the laws of any other state or the United States; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   a suitable treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services is able and has agreed to provide
appropriate treatment services in accordance with the requirements of this
section; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   no danger to the
community will result from the person being placed on special probation
pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In determining whether to
sentence the person pursuant to this section, the court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, and shall take judicial notice of any evidence,
testimony or information adduced at the trial, plea hearing or other court proceedings,
and shall also consider the presentence report and the results of the
professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent the
person is drug or alcohol dependent and would benefit from treatment.  The
court shall give priority to a person who has moved to be sentenced to special
probation over a person who is being considered for a sentence to special
probation on the court's own motion or in accordance with the provisions of
section 2 of P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a condition of special
probation, the court shall order the person to enter a residential treatment
program at a facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health
and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services or a program of nonresidential
treatment by a licensed and approved treatment provider, which program may
include the use of medication-assisted treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of
subsection f. of this section, to comply with program rules and the
requirements of the course of treatment, to cooperate fully with the treatment
provider, and to comply with such other reasonable terms and conditions as may
be required by the court or by law, pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1, and which shall
include periodic urine testing for drug or alcohol usage throughout the period
of special probation.  In determining whether to order the person to
participate in a nonresidential rather than a residential treatment program,
the court shall follow the procedure set forth in subsection j. of this
section. Subject to the requirements of subsection d. of this section, the
conditions of special probation may include different methods and levels of
community-based or residential supervision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person shall not be
eligible for special probation pursuant to this section if the person is
convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a crime of the first
degree, <u>except as provided in section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill)</u>;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a crime of the first or
second degree enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117
(C.2C:43-7.2), other than a crime of the second degree involving N.J.S.2C:15-1
(robbery) or N.J.S.2C:18-2 (burglary);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a crime, other than that
defined in section 1 of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7), for which a mandatory
minimum period of incarceration is prescribed under chapter 35 of this Title or
any other law; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   an offense that involved
the distribution or the conspiracy or attempt to distribute a controlled
dangerous substance or controlled substance analog to a juvenile near or on
school property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.2012, c.23)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Except as otherwise
provided in subsection j. of this section, a person convicted of or adjudicated
delinquent for a crime of the second degree or of a violation of section 1 of
P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7), or who previously has been convicted of or
adjudicated delinquent for an offense under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 or a
similar offense under any other law of this State, any other state or the
United States, who is placed on special probation under this section shall be
committed to the custody of a residential substance use disorders treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services in the Department of Human Services.  Subject to the authority of the
court to temporarily suspend imposition of all or any portion of the term of
commitment to a residential treatment facility pursuant to subsection j. of this
section, the person shall be committed to the residential treatment facility
immediately, unless the facility cannot accommodate the person, in which case
the person shall be incarcerated to await commitment to the residential
treatment facility.  The term of such commitment shall be for a minimum of six
months, or until the court, upon recommendation of the treatment provider,
determines that the person has successfully completed the residential treatment
program, whichever is later, except that no person shall remain in the custody
of a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section for a period in
excess of five years.  Upon successful completion of the required residential
treatment program, the person shall complete the period of special probation,
as authorized by subsection a. of this section, with credit for time served for
any imprisonment served as a condition of probation and credit for each day
during which the person satisfactorily complied with the terms and conditions
of special probation while committed pursuant to this section to a residential
treatment facility.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection l. of this
section, the person shall not be eligible for early discharge of special
probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-2, or any other provision of the law.  The
court, in determining the number of credits for time spent in residential
treatment, shall consider the recommendations of the treatment provider.  A
person placed into a residential treatment facility pursuant to this section
shall be deemed to be subject to official detention for the purposes of
N.J.S.2C:29-5 (escape).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The probation
department or other appropriate agency designated by the court to monitor or
supervise the person's special probation shall report periodically to the court
as to the person's progress in treatment and compliance with court-imposed
terms and conditions.  The treatment provider shall promptly report to the
probation department or other appropriate agency all significant failures by
the person to comply with any court imposed term or condition of special
probation or any requirements of the course of treatment, including but not
limited to a positive drug or alcohol test, which shall only constitute a
violation for a person using medication-assisted treatment as defined in
paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the positive test is
unrelated to the person's medication-assisted treatment, or the unexcused
failure to attend any session or activity, and shall immediately report any act
that would constitute an escape.  The probation department or other appropriate
agency shall immediately notify the court and the prosecutor in the event that
the person refuses to submit to a periodic drug or alcohol test or for any
reason terminates the person's participation in the course of treatment, or
commits any act that would constitute an escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  (1)  Upon a first
violation of any term or condition of the special probation authorized by this
section or of any requirements of the course of treatment, the court in its
discretion may permanently revoke the person's special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon a second or
subsequent violation of any term or condition of the special probation
authorized by this section or of any requirements of the course of treatment,
the court shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g. of this
section, permanently revoke the person's special probation unless the court
finds on the record that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will
successfully complete the treatment program if permitted to continue on special
probation, and the court is clearly convinced, considering the nature and
seriousness of the violations, that no danger to the community will result from
permitting the person to continue on special probation pursuant to this
section.  The court's determination to permit the person to continue on special
probation following a second or subsequent violation pursuant to this paragraph
may be appealed by the prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   In making its determination
whether to revoke special probation, and whether to overcome the presumption of
revocation established in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court shall
consider the nature and seriousness of the present infraction and any past
infractions in relation to the person's overall progress in the course of
treatment, and shall also consider the recommendations of the treatment
provider.  The court shall give added weight to the treatment provider's
recommendation that the person's special probation be permanently revoked, or
to the treatment provider's opinion that the person is not amenable to
treatment or is not likely to complete the treatment program successfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If the court permanently
revokes the person's special probation pursuant to this subsection, the court
shall impose any sentence that might have been imposed, or that would have been
required to be imposed, originally for the offense for which the person was
convicted or adjudicated delinquent.  The court shall conduct a de novo review
of any aggravating and mitigating factors present at the time of both original
sentencing and resentencing.  If the court determines or is required pursuant
to any other provision of this chapter or any other law to impose a term of
imprisonment, the person shall receive credit for any time served in custody
pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1 or while awaiting placement in a treatment facility
pursuant to this section, and for each day during which the person
satisfactorily complied with the terms and conditions of special probation
while committed pursuant to this section to a residential treatment facility. 
The court, in determining the number of credits for time spent in a residential
treatment facility, shall consider the recommendations of the treatment
provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Following a violation,
if the court permits the person to continue on special probation pursuant to
this section, the court shall order the person to comply with such additional
terms and conditions, including but not limited to more frequent drug or alcohol
testing, as are necessary to deter and promptly detect any further violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Notwithstanding any
other provision of this subsection, if the person at any time refuses to
undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol usage as provided in subsection a. of
this section, the court shall, subject only to the provisions of subsection g.
of this section, permanently revoke the person's special probation. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the person at any time
while committed to the custody of a residential treatment facility pursuant to
this section commits an act that would constitute an escape, the court shall
forthwith permanently revoke the person's special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An action for a
violation under this section may be brought by a probation officer or
prosecutor or on the court's own motion.  Failure to complete successfully the
required treatment program shall constitute a violation of the person's special
probation. In the case of the temporary or continued management of a person's
drug or alcohol dependency by means of medication-assisted treatment as defined
herein, whenever supported by a report from the treatment provider of existing
satisfactory progress and reasonably predictable long-term success with or
without further medication-assisted treatment, the person's use of the
medication-assisted treatment, even if continuing, shall not be the basis to
constitute a failure to complete successfully the treatment program.  A person
who fails to comply with the terms of the person's special probation pursuant
to this section and is thereafter sentenced to imprisonment in accordance with
this subsection shall thereafter be ineligible for entry into the Intensive
Supervision Program, provided however that this provision shall not affect the
person's eligibility for entry into the Intensive Supervision Program for a
subsequent conviction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this section, the
term &quot;medication-assisted treatment&quot; means the use of any medications
approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration to treat substance use
disorders, including extended-release naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine,
in combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to provide a
whole-patient approach to the treatment of substance use disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    When a person on special
probation is subject to a presumption of revocation on a second or subsequent
violation pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section, or when
the person refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing pursuant to paragraph (6)
of subsection f. of this section, the court may, in lieu of permanently
revoking the person's special probation, impose a term of incarceration for a
period of not less than 30 days nor more than six months, after which the
person's term of special probation pursuant to this section may be reinstated. 
In determining whether to order a period of incarceration in lieu of permanent
revocation pursuant to this subsection, the court shall consider the
recommendations of the treatment provider with respect to the likelihood that
such confinement would serve to motivate the person to make satisfactory
progress in treatment once special probation is reinstated.  This disposition
may occur only once with respect to any person unless the court is clearly convinced
that there are compelling and extraordinary reasons to justify reimposing this
disposition with respect to the person.  Any such determination by the court to
reimpose this disposition may be appealed by the prosecution.  Nothing in this
subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the court at any time
during the period of special probation to order a person on special probation
who is not subject to a presumption of revocation pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subsection f. of this section to be incarcerated over the course of a weekend,
or for any other reasonable period of time, when the court in its discretion
determines that such incarceration would help to motivate the person to make
satisfactory progress in treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The court, as a condition
of its order, and after considering the person's financial resources, shall
require the person to pay that portion of the costs associated with the
person's participation in any residential or nonresidential treatment program
imposed pursuant to this section which, in the opinion of the court, is
consistent with the person's ability to pay, taking into account the court's
authority to order payment or reimbursement to be made over time and in
installments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The court shall impose,
as a condition of the special probation, any fine, penalty, fee or restitution
applicable to the offense for which the person was convicted or adjudicated
delinquent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Where the court finds
that a person has satisfied all of the eligibility criteria for special probation
and would otherwise be required to be committed to the custody of a residential
substance use disorders treatment facility pursuant to the provisions of
subsection d. of this section, the court may temporarily suspend imposition of
all or any portion of the term of commitment to a residential treatment
facility and may instead order the person to enter a nonresidential treatment
program, provided that the court finds on the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person conducting
the diagnostic assessment required pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a.
of this section has recommended in writing that the proposed course of
nonresidential treatment services is clinically appropriate and adequate to
address the person's treatment needs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   no danger to the community
would result from the person participating in the proposed course of
nonresidential treatment services; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a suitable treatment
provider is able and has agreed to provide clinically appropriate
nonresidential treatment services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the prosecutor objects to
the court's decision to suspend the commitment of the person to a residential
treatment facility pursuant to this subsection, the sentence of special
probation imposed pursuant to this section shall not become final for ten days
in order to permit the appeal by the prosecution of the court's decision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After a period of six months
of nonresidential treatment, if the court, considering all available
information including but not limited to the recommendation of the treatment
provider, finds that the person has made satisfactory progress in treatment and
that there is a substantial likelihood that the person will successfully
complete the nonresidential treatment program and period of special probation,
the court, on notice to the prosecutor, may permanently suspend the commitment
of the person to the custody of a residential treatment program, in which event
the special monitoring provisions set forth in subsection k. of this section
shall no longer apply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to limit the authority of the court at any time during the
term of special probation to order the person to be committed to a residential
or nonresidential treatment facility if the court determines that such
treatment is clinically appropriate and necessary to address the person's
present treatment needs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  (1)  When the court
temporarily suspends the commitment of the person to a residential treatment
facility pursuant to subsection j. of this section, the court shall, in
addition to ordering participation in a prescribed course of nonresidential
treatment and any other appropriate terms or conditions authorized or required
by law, order the person to undergo urine testing for drug or alcohol use not
less than once per week unless otherwise ordered by the court.  The
court-ordered testing shall be conducted by the probation department or the
treatment provider.  The results of all tests shall be reported promptly to the
court and to the prosecutor.  If the person is involved with a program that is providing
the person medication-assisted treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of
subsection f. of this section, only a positive urine test for drug or alcohol
use unrelated to the medication-assisted treatment shall constitute a violation
of the terms and conditions of special probation.  In addition, the court shall
impose appropriate curfews or other restrictions on the person's movements, and
may order the person to wear electronic monitoring devices to enforce such
curfews or other restrictions as a condition of special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The probation department
or other appropriate agency shall immediately notify the court and the
prosecutor in the event that the person fails or refuses to submit to a drug or
alcohol test, knowingly defrauds the administration of a drug test, terminates
the person's participation in the course of treatment, or commits any act that
would constitute absconding from parole.  If the person at any time while
entered in a nonresidential treatment program pursuant to subsection j. of this
section knowingly defrauds the administration of a drug test, goes into hiding,
or leaves the State with a purpose of avoiding supervision, the court shall
permanently revoke the person's special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     If the court finds that
the person has made exemplary progress in the course of treatment, the court
may, upon recommendation of the person's supervising probation officer or on
the court's own motion, and upon notice to the prosecutor, grant early
discharge from a term of special probation provided that the person: (1) has
satisfactorily completed the treatment program ordered by the court; (2) has
served at least two years of special probation; (3) within the preceding 12
months, did not commit a substantial violation of any term or condition of
special probation, including but not limited to a positive urine test, which
shall only constitute a violation for a person using medication-assisted
treatment as defined in paragraph (7) of subsection f. of this section if the
positive test is unrelated to the person's medication-assisted treatment; and
(4) is not likely to relapse or commit an offense if probation supervision and
related services are discontinued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.  (1)  The Superior Court
may order the expungement of all records and information relating to all prior
arrests, detentions, convictions, and proceedings for any offense enumerated in
Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes upon successful discharge from a term of
special probation as provided in this section, regardless of whether the person
was sentenced to special probation under this section, section 2 of P.L.2012,
c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2), or N.J.S.2C:45-1, if the person satisfactorily completed a
substance abuse treatment program as ordered by the court and was not convicted
of any crime, or adjudged a disorderly person or petty disorderly person,
during the term of special probation. The provisions of N.J.S.2C:52-7 through
N.J.S.2C:52-14 shall not apply to an expungement pursuant to this paragraph and
no fee shall be charged to a person eligible for relief pursuant to this
paragraph.  The court shall grant the relief requested unless it finds that the
need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having
the person freed from any disabilities associated with their availability, or
it finds that the person is otherwise ineligible for expungement pursuant to
paragraph (2) of this subsection.  An expungement under this paragraph shall
proceed in accordance with rules and procedures developed by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A person shall not be
eligible for expungement under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the records
include a conviction for any offense barred from expungement pursuant to
subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2. It shall be the obligation of the
prosecutor to notify the court of any disqualifying convictions or any other
factors related to public safety that should be considered by the court when
deciding to grant an expungement under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The Superior Court shall
provide a copy of the expungement order granted pursuant to paragraph (1) of
this subsection to the prosecutor and to the person and, if the person was
represented by the Public Defender, to the Public Defender. The person or, if
the person was represented by the Public Defender, the Public Defender on
behalf of the person, shall promptly distribute copies of the expungement order
to appropriate agencies who have custody and control of the records specified
in the order so that the agencies may comply with the requirements of
N.J.S.2C:52-15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   If the person whose
records are expunged pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection is convicted
of any crime following discharge from special probation, the full record of
arrests and convictions may be restored to public access and no future
expungement shall be granted to such person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A person who, prior to
the effective date of P.L.2015, c.261, was successfully discharged from a term
of special probation as provided in this section, regardless of whether the
person was sentenced to special probation under this section, section 2 of
P.L.2012, c.23 (C.2C:35-14.2), or N.J.S.2C:45-1, may seek an expungement of all
records and information relating to all arrests, detentions, convictions, and
proceedings for any offense enumerated in Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes
that existed at the time of discharge from special probation by presenting an
application to the Superior Court in the county in which the person was
sentenced to special probation, which contains a duly verified petition as
provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 for each crime or offense sought to be expunged.  The
petition for expungement shall proceed pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-1 et seq. except
that the requirements related to the expiration of the time periods specified in
N.J.S.2C:52-2 through section 1 of P.L.1980, c.163 (C.2C:52-4.1) shall not
apply. A person who was convicted of any offense barred from expungement
pursuant to subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2, or who has been convicted of
any crime or offense since the date of discharge from special probation shall
not be eligible to apply for an expungement under this paragraph.  In addition,
no application for expungement shall be considered until any pending charges
are disposed.  It shall be the obligation of the prosecutor to notify the court
of any disqualifying convictions or any other factors related to public safety
that should be considered by the court when deciding to grant an expungement
under this paragraph.  The Superior Court shall consider the person's verified
petition and may order the expungement of all records and information relating
to all arrests, detentions, convictions, and proceedings of the person that
existed at the time of discharge from special probation as appropriate.  The
court shall grant the relief requested unless it finds that the need for the
availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having the person
freed from any disabilities associated with their availability, or it finds
that the person is otherwise ineligible for expungement pursuant to this
paragraph.  No fee shall be charged to a person eligible for relief pursuant to
this paragraph.</p>

penalties for certain crimes involving heroin and fentanyl. The bill also
establishes new crimes addressing two types of heroin mixtures: heroin
mixtures with fentanyl, and heroin mixtures without fentanyl.  A heroin mixture
as defined in the bill is heroin mixed with at least one other controlled
dangerous substance.</p>

Heroin Mixtures Containing CDS other Than Fentanyl</span>.  Currently, it is a
crime of the first degree to manufacture, distribute, or dispense heroin or its
analog in a quantity of five ounces or more including any adulterants or
dilutants. The defendant must also be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of
one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, during which the defendant is
ineligible for parole, and a fine of up to $500,000.  It is a crime of the
second degree if the quantity of heroin or its analog is one-half ounce or more
but less than five ounces including any adulterants or dilutants.  It is a
crime of the third degree if the quantity is less than one-half ounce including
any adulterants or dilutants.  The penalty for the third degree crime includes
an increased fine of up to $75,000.</p>

be a crime of the second degree to manufacture, distribute, or dispense heroin
or its analog including adulterants or dilutants in a quantity of five grams or
more but less than 10 grams.  If the quantity is less than five grams it would
be a crime of the third degree, with an increased fine of up to $75,000.</p>

ounce, except that an increased fine of up to $75,000 may be imposed.  Under
the bill, it would be a crime of the first degree to unlawfully manufacture, distribute,

Definitions</span>.  The bill adds definitions of the terms heroin mixture
and adulterants or dilutants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a heroin
mixture is a substance containing heroin, or its analog, and at least one
other controlled dangerous substance classified as a narcotic drug or its
analog that have been combined by any means so that the injection, inhalation,
or ingestion of the mixture would result in the consumption of two or more
controlled dangerous substances or analogs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Adulterants or dilutants
are substances which are mixed or combined with a controlled dangerous
substance and any medium which is used to carry a controlled dangerous
substance, if the controlled dangerous substance is not readily removable from
the medium. The terms include, but are not limited to, blotter paper, stamps or
cigarettes.</p>

or alcohol dependent person convicted of certain offenses may be placed on a
five-year term of special probation (drug court) in lieu of incarceration. As a
condition of special probation, the court will order the person to enter a
residential treatment program at a licensed facility or a program of
nonresidential treatment by a licensed and approved treatment provider. 
Persons convicted of a crime of the first degree are ineligible to be sentenced
to special probation under the current statute.  Under the bill, certain
categories of such persons would be eligible to be sentenced to special
probation.</p>

under N.J.S.2C:35-14 but for having been convicted of the crime of the first
degree, and further provided that the court is clearly convinced and finds on
the record that the defendant has established that he is not a drug profiteer
