(1) An owner proposing a roadside right-of-way solar energy project shall submit an application to the board before constructing, installing, or operating the project.  The board shall consult with the commissioner in the review and approval of all roadside right-of-way solar energy projects under the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program.  In reviewing and making decisions on roadside right-of-way solar energy projects, the board and Commissioner shall give consideration to criteria including, but not limited to: (a) proposals for monitoring the traffic volume, accident count, and safety of the adjacent roadway; (b) the incentive level sought by the applicant; (c) geographic location; (d) interconnection planning; (e) proposals for minimizing negative impacts to roadways; (f) proposals to address decommissioning; (g) proposals for addressing stormwater runoff, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and other environmental issues; (h) technical feasibility; (i) technical innovation; (j) the quality of any research committed to during the evaluation period; and (k) any other criteria as may be deemed advisable by the board. The review shall also consider whether the selected projects are of varying sizes.  The board, in consultation with the commissioner, shall, within 180 days after receipt, approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions, an application submitted pursuant to this section. (2) An owner who receives approval from the board pursuant to this section shall obtain all necessary permits and other approvals as may be required pursuant to federal, State, or local law, rule, regulation, or ordinance, prior to the construction of the roadside right-of-way solar energy project. e.     The commissioner may request that the board suspend or revoke an approval issued pursuant to this section for a violation of any term or condition of the approval or any provision of this section. f.     The Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program shall continue for 36 months after the adoption of the rules and regulations required pursuant to subsection a. of this section, except that the board may extend the pilot program by no more than two additional 12-month periods if the board, in consultation with the commissioner, determines that such extensions are necessary to adequately evaluate the performance of the projects selected for construction as part of the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program.  If the board extends the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program, it may increase the total capacity limit of all projects under the program by no more than 50 megawatts, as measured in direct current, per additional 12-month period. g.    Notwithstanding any law, ordinance, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a roadside right-of-way solar energy project approved pursuant to this section shall be a permitted use within every municipality. h.    No later than 36 months, or no later than 48 or 60 months if applicable due to extensions of the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program pursuant to subsection f. of this section, after adoption of the rules and regulations required pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the board, in consultation with the commissioner, shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to convert the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program to a permanent program as part of the successor to the solar incentive program established pursuant to P.L.2021, c.169 (C.48:3-114 et al.).   The rules and regulations for the permanent program shall set forth standards for roadside right-of-way solar energy projects that take into account the results of the pilot program and any research studies on the efficacy of roadside right-of-way solar energy in New Jersey, and shall include, but not be limited to: (1) a capacity limit for individual roadside right-of-way solar energy projects; (2) a total annual capacity limit; (3) provisions to reduce or offset emissions from New Jersey's road systems, and provisions to protect driver safety; (4) standards for: installation and decommissioning techniques that minimize negative impacts to traffic, which may include the posting of a performance bond for decommissioning; impervious coverage; emissions management; and stormwater management; (5) siting criteria and restrictions, which may differ from those established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2021, c.169 (C.48:3-119) to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Roadside Right-of-Way Solar Energy Pilot Program; and (6) an application process, including such fees, escrows, or deposits as shall be determined by the board. 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow an owner of a solar energy generator to construct, install, and operate a roadside right-of-way solar energy project on the right-of-way area, subject to certain conditions set forth in the bill.  The bill defines roadside right-of-way energy project as energy generation facilities, structures, and equipment for the production of less than 10 megawatts of electric power from solar photovoltaic panels located on land in roadside right-of-way areas that allow the uninterrupted traffic patterns of roadways and highway systems below or adjacent to the panels. To be eligible under the bill, the owner or developer of the right-of-way solar development would be required to obtain approval of the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and other approvals that may be required pursuant to federal, State or local regulations, prior to the construction of the roadside right-of-way solar energy project. Prior to constructing, installing, and operating a roadside right-of-way solar energy facility, the owner or developer would be required to apply to the BPU for approval.  The BPU, in consultation with the DOT, would be required to review and, within 180 days after receipt, approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions the application. The bill directs the BPU, in consultation with the DOT, to adopt rules and regulations, including, but not limited to: the process by which an owner may apply for the approval required by the bill; the establishment of reasonable application fees to pay for the cost of review of the application; and provisions prescribing standards concerning impervious cover which may be permitted in connection with roadside right-of-way solar energy projects. The bill also establishes criteria by which the BPU and DOT would review these applications, including proposals for monitoring traffic volume, the size of the project, accident count, and driver safety, incentives available to applicants, geographic location, interconnection planning, negative impacts to roadways, decommissioning processes, proposals to address stormwater runoff, emissions reduction, and other environmental issues, technical feasibility and innovation, the quality of research committed during the evaluation period, and any other criteria as deemed advisable by the BPU.
