exemptions for urban aid municipalities and amending P.L.1985, c.222.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The New Jersey Supreme
Court, through its rulings in South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67
N.J. 151 (1975) and South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158
(1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a
constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a
realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective needs
for housing for low and moderate income families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the second Mount
Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods
for satisfying this constitutional obligation &quot;is better left to the
Legislature,&quot; that the court has &quot;always preferred legislative to
judicial action in their field,&quot; and that the judicial role in upholding
the Mount Laurel doctrine &quot;could decrease as a result of legislative and
executive action.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The interest of all
citizens, including low and moderate income families in need of affordable
housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a
comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional
obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There are a number of
essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response,
including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and
standards, the initial determination of fair share by officials at the
municipal level and the preparation of a municipal housing element, State
review of the local fair share study and housing element, and continuous State
funding for low and moderate income housing to replace the federal housing
subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State can maximize
the number of low and moderate income units provided in New Jersey by allowing
its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their
fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an
appropriate fair share of the regional need for low and moderate income housing
as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and other relevant court
decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The State can also
maximize the number of low and moderate income units by creating new affordable
housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State. 
Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46
(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in harmony with
the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share obligations
among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and appropriate
to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to foster the
rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Since the urban areas
are vitally important to the State, <u>the</u> construction, conversion<u>,</u>
and rehabilitation of housing in our urban centers <b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>should be encouraged<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>shall be
an essential part of achieving the fair share of the regional need for low and
moderate income housing</u>.  However, the provision of housing in urban areas
must be balanced with the need to provide housing throughout the State for the
free mobility of citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The Supreme Court of New
Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use
regulations affirmatively afford a reasonable opportunity for a variety and
choice of housing including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of
people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction of
that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not
mandated to expend their own resources to help provide low and moderate income
housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Certain amendments to
the enabling act of the Council on Affordable Housing are necessary to provide
guidance to the council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent,
while at the same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its
rulemaking.  Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the
Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its rulemaking,
the Legislature retains its power and obligation to clarify and amend the
enabling act from which the council derives its rulemaking power, from time to
time, in order to better guide the council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The Legislature finds
that the use of regional contribution agreements, which permits municipalities
to transfer a certain portion of their fair share housing obligation outside of
the municipal borders, should no longer be utilized as a mechanism for the
creation of affordable housing by the council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>k.    To minimize undue
burdens on individual municipalities, reduce urban sprawl, and direct
development to areas that already have extensive infrastructure in place and
can more cost-effectively accommodate new development, each urban municipality

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Municipal determination
of its present and prospective fair share of the housing need in a given region
which shall be computed for a 10-year period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Municipal fair share shall be
determined after crediting on a one-to-one basis each current unit of low and
moderate income housing of adequate standard, including any such housing
constructed or acquired as part of a housing program specifically intended to
provide housing for low and moderate income households<u>; provided, however,
that the council shall not exempt an urban municipality from any fair share
obligation based exclusively on current units of low and moderate income
housing</u>.  Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a municipality
shall be entitled to a credit for a unit if it demonstrates that (a) the
municipality issued a certificate of occupancy for the unit, which was either
newly constructed or rehabilitated between April 1, 1980 and December 15, 1986;
(b) a construction code official certifies, based upon a visual exterior
survey, that the unit is in compliance with pertinent construction code
standards with respect to structural elements, roofing, siding, doors and
windows; (c) the household occupying the unit certifies in writing, under
penalty of perjury, that it receives no greater income than that established
pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-304) to qualify for moderate
income housing; and (d) the unit for which credit is sought is affordable to
low and moderate income households under the standards established by the
council at the time of filing of the petition for substantive certification. 
It shall be sufficient if the certification required in subparagraph (c) is
signed by one member of the household.  A certification submitted pursuant to
this paragraph shall be reviewable only by the council or its staff and shall
not be a public record;</p>

shall affect the validity of substantive certification granted by the council
prior to November 21, 1994, or of a judgment of compliance entered by any court
of competent jurisdiction prior to that date.  Additionally, any municipality
that received substantive certification or a judgment of compliance prior to
November 21, 1994 and filed a motion prior to November 21, 1994 to amend
substantive certification or a judgment of compliance for the purpose of
obtaining credits, shall be entitled to a determination of its right to credits
pursuant to the standards established by the Legislature prior to P.L.1995,
c.81.  Any municipality that filed a motion prior to November 21, 1994 for the
purpose of obtaining credits, which motion was supported by the results of a
completed survey performed pursuant to council rules, shall be entitled to a
determination of its right to credits pursuant to the standards established by

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In its discretion,
place a limit, based on a percentage of existing housing stock in a
municipality and any other criteria including employment opportunities which
the council deems appropriate, upon the aggregate number of units which may be
allocated to a municipality as its fair share of the region's present and
prospective need for low and moderate income housing.  No municipality shall be
required to address a fair share of housing units affordable to households with
a gross household income of less than 80% of the median gross household income
beyond 1,000 units within ten years from the grant of substantive
certification, unless it is demonstrated, following objection by an interested
party and an evidentiary hearing, based upon the facts and circumstances of the
affected municipality that it is likely that the municipality through its
zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low and
moderate income units within that ten-year period.  For the purposes of this
section, the facts and circumstances which shall determine whether a
municipality's fair share shall exceed 1,000 units, as provided above, shall be
a finding that the municipality has issued more than 5,000 certificates of
occupancy for residential units in the ten-year period preceding the petition
for substantive certification in connection with which the objection was filed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purpose of crediting
low and moderate income housing units in order to arrive at a determination of present
and prospective fair share, as set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of
this section, housing units comprised in a community residence for the
developmentally disabled, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.448
(C.30:11B-2), shall be fully credited pursuant to rules promulgated or to be
promulgated by the council, to the extent that the units are affordable to
persons of low and moderate income and are available to the general public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The council, with respect to
any municipality seeking substantive certification, shall require that a
minimum percentage of housing units in any residential development resulting
from a zoning change made to a previously non-residentially-zoned property,
where the change in zoning precedes or follows the application for residential
development by no more than 24 months, be reserved for occupancy by low or
moderate income households, which percentage shall be determined by the council
based on economic feasibility with consideration for the proposed density of development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In carrying out the above
duties, including, but not limited to, present and prospective need estimations
the council shall give appropriate weight to pertinent research studies,
government reports, decisions of other branches of government, implementation
of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan prepared pursuant to sections 1
through 12 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et seq.) and public comment.  To
assist the council, the State Planning Commission established under that act
shall provide the council annually with economic growth, development and
decline projections for each housing region for the next ten years.  The
council shall develop procedures for periodically adjusting regional need based
upon the low and moderate income housing that is provided in the region through
any federal, State, municipal or private housing program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No housing unit subject to the
provisions of section 5 of P.L.2005, c.350 (C.52:27D-123.15) and to the
provisions of the barrier free subcode adopted by the Commissioner of Community
Affairs pursuant to the &quot;State Uniform Construction Code Act,&quot;
P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.) shall be eligible for inclusion in the
municipal fair share plan certified by the council unless the unit complies with
the requirements set forth thereunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
&quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), to prohibit
any categorical affordable housing obligation exemption for municipalities that
are eligible for the Municipal (Urban) Aid Program.  Prior rules of the Council
on Affordable Housing excluded these municipalities from providing any contribution
toward a regions affordable housing need.  Those exemptions, however, can lead
to undue development burdens on the other municipalities in the region. 
Additionally, directing more affordable housing development to urban
municipalities would help minimize urban sprawl and would direct development to
areas that already have extensive infrastructure in place, allowing for more
cost-effective accommodation of new development. </p>
