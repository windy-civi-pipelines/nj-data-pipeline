Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 2 of P.L.1961,
c.49 (C.52:14-17.26) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in P.L.1961,
c.49 (C.52:14-17.26 et seq.):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The term
&quot;State&quot; means the State of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The term
&quot;commission&quot; means the State Health Benefits Commission, created by
section 3 of P.L.1961, c.49 <br>
(C.52:14-17.27).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   (1) The term
&quot;employee&quot; means an appointive or elective officer, a full-time
employee of the State of New Jersey, or a full-time employee of an employer
other than the State who appears on a regular payroll and receives a salary or
wages for an average of the number of hours per week as prescribed by the
governing body of the participating employer which number of hours worked shall
be considered full-time, determined by resolution, and not less than 20.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   After the effective date
of P.L.2010, c.2, the term &quot;employee&quot; means: (i) a full-time
appointive or elective officer whose hours of work are fixed at 35 or more per
week, a full-time employee of the State, or a full-time employee of an employer
other than the State who appears on a regular payroll and receives a salary or
wages for an average of the number of hours per week as prescribed by the
governing body of the participating employer which number of hours worked shall
be considered full-time, determined by resolution, and not less than 25; (ii)
an appointive or elective officer, an employee of the State, or an employee of
an employer other than the State who has or is eligible for health benefits
coverage provided under P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.) or sections 31
through 41 of P.L.2007, c.103 (C.52:14-17.46.1 et seq.) on that effective date
and continuously thereafter, provided the officer or employee is covered by the
definition in paragraph (1) of this subsection; or (iii) every commissioner
appointed to the New Jersey Maritime Pilot and Docking Pilot Commission
pursuant to R.S.12:8-1.  Any hour or part thereof, during which an employee
does not work due to the employee's participation in a voluntary or mandatory
furlough program shall not be deducted in determining if a person's hours of
work are fixed at fewer than 35 or 32 per week, as appropriate, for the purpose
of eligibility for health benefits coverage provided under P.L.1961, c.49
(C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), provided the employee continues to pay contributions
for coverage during the period of furlough.  If the pay of a furloughed
employee is insufficient to withhold the entirety of the employee's
contribution, then the employee shall remit the portion of the contribution not
withheld from the employee's pay to the Division of Pensions and Benefits in
the Department of the Treasury in a manner determined by the division, except
that no deduction for the payment of such contributions shall be made from the
unemployment compensation benefits of the employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(3) After the effective
date of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill),
the term employee shall include a member of the Legislature.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this act,
an employee of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, shall be deemed to
be an employee of the State, and an employee of the New Jersey Institute of
Technology shall be considered to be an employee of the State during such time
as the Trustees of the Institute are party to a contractual agreement with the
State Treasurer for the provision of educational services.  The term
&quot;employee&quot; shall further mean, for purposes of this act, a former
employee of the South Jersey Port Corporation, who is employed by a subsidiary
corporation or other corporation, which has been established by the Delaware River
Port Authority pursuant to subdivision (m) of Article I of the compact creating
the Delaware River Port Authority (R.S.32:3-2), as defined in section 3 of
P.L.1997, c.150 (C.34:1B-146), and who is eligible for continued membership in
the Public Employees' Retirement System pursuant to subsection j. of section 7
of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this act
the term &quot;employee&quot; shall not include persons employed on a
short-term, seasonal, intermittent or emergency basis, persons compensated on a
fee basis, persons having less than two months of continuous service or persons
whose compensation from the State is limited to reimbursement of necessary
expenses actually incurred in the discharge of their official duties, provided,
however, that the term &quot;employee&quot; shall include persons employed on
an intermittent basis to whom the State has agreed to provide coverage under
P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.) in accordance with a binding collective
negotiations agreement.  An employee paid on a 10-month basis, pursuant to an
annual contract, will be deemed to have satisfied the two-month waiting period
if the employee begins employment at the beginning of the contract year.  The
term &quot;employee&quot; shall also not include retired persons who are otherwise
eligible for benefits under this act but who, although they meet the age or
disability eligibility requirement of Medicare, are not covered by Medicare
Hospital Insurance, also known as Medicare Part A, and Medicare Medical
Insurance, also known as Medicare Part B.  A determination by the commission
that a person is an eligible employee within the meaning of this act shall be
final and shall be binding on all parties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) (1) The term
&quot;dependents&quot; means an employee's spouse, partner in a civil union couple
or an employee's domestic partner as defined in section 3 of P.L.2003, c.246
(C.26:8A-3), and the employee's unmarried children under the age of 23 years
who live with the employee in a regular parent-child relationship. 
&quot;Children&quot; shall include stepchildren, legally adopted children and
