The appraisal process shall include an examination of previous transactions in the municipality or municipalities, as the case may be, and shall reflect what a willing buyer, under no pressure to buy, would pay a willing seller, under no pressure to sell, for a plenary retail consumption license in that municipality or municipalities, as the case may be.  One half of the amount of the application fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be paid upon the issuance of the license and the other half of that amount shall be paid one year later.  The director shall establish an annual fee for the license which shall not exceed the fee which may be imposed by a municipality for a plenary retail consumption license pursuant to R.S.33:1-12. g.    The fee for the initial issuance of the license shall be distributed in the following manner: (1)   Fifty percent shall be paid to the eligible municipality in which the license is issued; and (2)   Fifty percent shall be paid to the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. h.    If the individual corporation or entity holding the license determines to sell a license issued pursuant to this section, the license shall be sold for the sum paid pursuant to subsection f. of this section. i.     The director shall not issue a special concessionaire permit for any location or premises which is eligible to obtain a license to serve alcoholic beverages under the provisions of this act. j.     Pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), the director shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of seventh month next following the date of enactment, except the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage control may take anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill authorizes the issuance of special licenses in certain municipalities with shopping malls. Under the bill, the Director of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control, upon approval of an eligible municipality, may issue one special license for each plenary retail consumption license that is sited in a premises within a shopping mall located in the municipality. The license may be issued to one or more individual corporations or other types of legal entities operating a premises not located in a shopping mall, where alcoholic beverages are intended to be served. The license authorizes the sale of alcoholic beverages for immediate consumption on the operator's premises. The bill defines an eligible municipality as one in which at least one shopping mall is located and the number of plenary retail consumption licenses issued has reached the population limitation. A shopping mall is defined in the bill as an enclosed walkway or hall area under common ownership or control, that is open to the public and connects with or provides access to separate retail establishments, including at least one restaurant or other establishment that serves alcoholic beverages pursuant to a plenary retail consumption license. Current law provides that one plenary retail consumption license may be issued per 3,000 residents of a municipality. It has become increasingly common that plenary retail consumption licenses in municipalities with shopping malls are obtained, upon becoming available, by businesses located within the shopping malls, making it difficult for local businesses in downtowns and other areas of the municipalities to compete. This bill is intended to provide an alternate method for a business, such as a bar or restaurant, not located within a shopping mall to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
