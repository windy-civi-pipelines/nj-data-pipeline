(3)   A county, municipality, or board of education, or agency or instrumentality thereof, may apply to the Commissioner of Community Affairs for a reimbursement of the expense of a diaper changing table installation. e.     The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) in order to effectuate the purposes of this section.  The rules and regulations shall include, but not be limited to, standards for the placement of a baby diaper changing station, standards for the placement and appearance of the required signage, and the frequency and criteria of public access that shall cause a space to be designated as open to the public. f.     As used in this section: Group A or M occupancy means an Assembly Group A occupancy or a Mercantile Group M occupancy, as defined in chapter 3 of the 2015 New Jersey International Building Code or its successor, with the exception of a casino, nightclub, tavern, or bar. Public building means a group A or M occupancy owned by any entity of State or local government, including but not limited to a board of education, public institution of higher education, or an agency or instrumentality of county or municipal government. Substantial renovation means a construction or renovation project requiring a building permit and where the value of the renovation to the restroom exceeds $5,000. 2.  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a nonlapsing fund for the purpose of providing grants to applicants seeking reimbursement pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 3.

STATEMENT This bill would require baby diaper changing stations in any newly constructed men or women's public restroom maintained on any publicly-accessible floor of a group A or M occupancy within the State.  It would also require any group A or M occupancy to install changing stations during renovations to existing restrooms, costing $5,000 or more.  The bill would further require the owner or operator of a group A or M occupancy to post signage to direct visitors to baby diaper changing station-equipped restrooms, when newly-constructed or renovated. Additionally, the bill would require public buildings, that contain group A or M occupancies, to install baby diaper changing tables in each accessible floor of each group A or M occupancy on or before the first day of the 37th month following enactment.  If, however, the public building is a K-12 school, the bill would only require one changing table accessible to men and women per campus within the 37-month deadline.  A county, municipality, or board of education would be permitted to apply to the Department of Community Affairs (department) for a reimbursement of the expense of installation.  The bill establishes a nonlapsing fund in the department to reimburse certain applicants for this expense, and appropriates $500,000 from the general fund to this nonlapsing fund. Failure to comply with the provisions of this bill would result in liability for a penalty of not more than $500 for each violation. Under the bill, group A or M occupancy means an Assembly Group A occupancy or a Mercantile Group M occupancy, as defined in chapter 3 of the 2015 New Jersey International Building Code.  More specifically, the terms encompass the following: (1)  assembly group A occupancies include but are not limited to theaters, banquet halls and restaurants, amusement arcades, art galleries, bowling allies, community halls, courtrooms, dance halls, libraries, places of religious worship, waiting areas in transportation terminals, bleachers and grandstands, and arenas and stadiums; and (2)  mercantile group M occupancies include but are not limited to department stores, drug stores, markets, motor-fuel dispensing facilities, retail or wholesale stores, and sales rooms. Under the bill, casinos, nightclubs, taverns, and bars are excluded from the group A or M occupancy definition.
