(cf: P.L.2013, c.51, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill expands the reach of the statute by including those individuals who receive a financial benefit from participating in human trafficking without necessarily being an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager of the enterprise or scheme. Under the current law, a person commits the crime of human trafficking if he: (1)  knowingly holds, recruits, lures, entices, harbors, transports, provides or obtains, by any means, another, to engage in unlawful sexual activity or to provide labor or services:    by threats of serious bodily harm or physical restraint against the person or any other person;    by means of any scheme, plan or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that the person or any other person would suffer serious bodily harm or physical restraint;    by criminal coercion; or    by destroying, concealing, removing, confiscating, or possessing any passport, immigration-related document or other government document; or    by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of the law or legal process; or (2)  receives anything of value from participation as an organizer, supervisor, financier or manager in a scheme or course of conduct which violates paragraph (1) of this subsection.
