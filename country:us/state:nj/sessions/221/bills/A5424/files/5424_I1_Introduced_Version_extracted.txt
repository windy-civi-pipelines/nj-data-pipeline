A5424 ASSEMBLY, No. 5424 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 6, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  YVONNE LOPEZ District 19 (Middlesex) Assemblyman  REGINALD W. ATKINS District 20 (Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Moen SYNOPSIS Promotes housing availability and prevents speculation by imposing fee for institutional ownership of certain unproductive residential property. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning institutional investor ownership related to residential property and supplementing chapter 3 of Title 46 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  The demand for housing in New Jersey has steadily increased, with New Jersey experiencing the 10th fastest growth rate of all states and the fastest population growth of those states in the Northeast Region; b.  Conversely, the inventory of single-family homes continues to decline, with nearly 10 percent fewer homes available in January 2025 compared to January 2024, leading to an increase in median home prices of nearly 12 percent; c.  Complicating concerns related to supply and demand, institutional investors wield a tremendous amount of market power at significantly lower market shares; d.  The unique structure of the housing market enables institutional investors, through their purchasing behavior, to manipulate supply and demand in the markets for single-family home sales and single-family home rentals; e.  The reduced availability of real property and single-family homes is well-documented in an October 2022 study entitled "Buying New Jersey: The Rise of Institutional Ownership of Residential Properties," produced by the Office of Policy and External Affairs in the Department of Community Affairs, which examines recent trends in institutional ownership and the impact of the rise of institutional ownership on changes in residential sale prices and sales volume in this State; f.  While the study observes that approximately six percent, or one in seventeen residential properties, were institutionally owned as of 2020, over 71 percent of these properties are owned by corporate or business entities, and 22 percent were owned by trusts, such as real estate investment trusts; g.  As a result, State and local governments have attempted to address the reduced availability of real property and single-family homes, caused by institutional ownership and speculation by institutional investors, through various means; h.    While some methods appear to be effective where implemented, it is critical to allocate revenues generated in a manner most responsive to the needs of the State and the housing region; and i.  Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to promote housing availability and prevent land speculation by imposing a fee for institutional ownership of unproductive real property zoned for residential use to incentivize the productive use of real property, reduce land speculation, increase the availability of land and single-family homes, address the States housing shortage at a time when New Jerseys population continues to grow, and to use the revenues generated to best respond to the needs of the State, the States housing regions, New Jerseys municipalities, individual home purchasers, and renters. 2.  As used in P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Abandoned" or "vacant" means, with respect to real property: (1)  that at least two of the following conditions exist with respect to the property: (a)   overgrown or neglected vegetation; (b)  the accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers, or mail on the property; (c)   disconnected gas, electric, or water utility services to the property; (d)  the accumulation of hazardous, noxious, or unhealthy substances or materials on the property; (e)   the accumulation of junk, litter, trash, or debris on the property; (f)   the absence of window treatments such as blinds, curtains, or shutters; (g)  the absence of furnishings and personal items; (h)  statements of neighbors, delivery persons, representatives of an association of a planned real estate development, or government employees indicating that the residence is abandoned or vacant; (i)   windows or entrances to the property that are boarded up or closed off or multiple window panes that are damaged, broken, and unrepaired; (j)   doors to the property that are smashed through, broken off, unhinged, or continuously unlocked; (k)  a risk to the health, safety, or welfare of the public, or any adjoining or adjacent property owners, exists due to acts of vandalism, loitering, criminal conduct, or the physical destruction or deterioration of the property; (l)   an uncorrected violation of a municipal building, housing, or similar code during the preceding year, or an order by municipal authorities declaring the property to be unfit for occupancy and to remain vacant and unoccupied; (m) a written statement issued by the most recent owner expressing a clear intent to abandon the property; or (n)  any other reasonable indicia of abandonment.
