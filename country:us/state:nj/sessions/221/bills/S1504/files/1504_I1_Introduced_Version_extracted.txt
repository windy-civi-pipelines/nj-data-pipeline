(cf: P.L.1999, c.260, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would increase the minimum income threshold at which a person becomes liable for New Jersey gross income tax and is required to file a return. Currently, a single taxpayer, an estate or trust, or a married person filing separately with a gross income of $10,000 or less is not subject to the gross income tax or required to file a return.  A married coupled filing a joint return or an individual filing as head of household or as surviving spouse for federal income tax purposes with a gross income of $20,000 or less is not subject to the gross income tax or required to file a return. Under this bill, beginning in tax year 2022, these income thresholds would be increased from $10,000 to $12,000 and from $20,000 to $24,000.  These income thresholds have not been increased since tax year 2001.
