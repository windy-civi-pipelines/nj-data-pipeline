<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the source

plastic products that are collected in the municipal solid waste stream, and
(3) plastic products that have the effect of disrupting recycling processes,
including, but not limited to, single-use plastic items such as straws,
utensils, cups, plates, and plastic bags.  The definition of &quot;covered
material&quot; in section 1 of the bill would exclude various types of
products, including those regulated under certain federal laws.  Under the
bill, producers of the products described above (including producers of
products that are packaged in plastic packaging) would be required to decrease
the amount of the packaging or products that are sold annually, by weight, such
that, after two years, the quantity sold is 90 percent of the baseline amount, after
four years, the quantity sold is 80 percent of the baseline amount, after six
years, the quantity sold is 70 percent of the baseline amount, after eight years,
the quantity sold is 60 percent of the baseline amount, and, after 10 years,

Producers who violate these requirements would be liable to civil and civil
administrative penalties of up to $10,000 per day of noncompliance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend the
&quot;Toxic Packaging Reduction Act&quot; to prohibit the sale of packaging
(and products that are packaged in packaging) that contains certain substances,
including toxic metals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and vinyl
chloride.  Under current law, only packaging that contains lead, mercury,
cadmium, or hexavalent chromium is restricted under the &quot;Toxic Packaging
Reduction Act.&quot;  Persons who violate the provisions of the &quot;Toxic
Packaging Reduction Act&quot; are liable to civil and civil administrative
penalties of up to $7,500 per day of noncompliance, for a first offense. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would also
establish a Toxic Packaging Task Force, composed of the DEP commissioner or a
designee and four members of the public, appointed by the DEP commission and
the presiding officers of the Legislature.  The task force would be charged
with recommending additional chemicals to regulate under the &quot;Toxic
Packaging Reduction Act.&quot;  Under the bill, the DEP would be required to
adopt rules and regulations to regulate a chemical no later than one year after
the task force's recommendation.</p>
