In addition, if any [such] duly incorporated first aid and emergency or volunteer ambulance or rescue squad associations experience extraordinary need, the county or municipality may contribute an additional amount of not more than $70,000 annually; provided, however, that the need for such additional funds is established by the association and is directly related to the performance of said association's duties.  Whenever the total annual county or municipal contribution to an association exceeds $70,000, the chief financial officer of the county or municipality shall receive an audit performed by a certified public accountant or a registered municipal accountant of each association's financial records for the current year which shall certify to the governing body of the county or municipality that such records are being maintained in accordance with sound accounting principles.

STATEMENT The bill would allow counties and municipalities to provide up $70,000 of voluntary contributions to nonprofit veterans organizations located within the county or municipality.
