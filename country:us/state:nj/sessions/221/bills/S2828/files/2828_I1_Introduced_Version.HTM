The subsidy will reduce the purchase price of the medical cannabis or medical

required to coordinate with the Division of Medical Assistance and Health
Services in the Department of Human Services to develop this enrollment
verification system.  Medical cannabis dispensaries and clinical registrants
are to make patients and their caregivers aware of the subsidy program through
posted signage, and may provide additional notice of the program verbally,
