STATEMENT This bill provides that one or more police officers may be present at a senior residential center being used as a polling place or school if there is a request by the center or school.  This bill clarifies that the officers must be in plain clothes in both senior residential centers and schools. Under current law, police officers are permitted to be present at a senior residential center being used as a polling place.  The provision of current law that prohibits any such officer from interfering with any person present at the location for the purpose of voting will remain in place. This bill also requires the center notify the district board if the center requests a police officer, the district board then will notify the county board of elections or superintendent of elections who will notify the Secretary of State.
