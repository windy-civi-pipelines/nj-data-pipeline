The bill adopts the U.S. Small Business Administrations definitions of a small business based on size standards and other applicable criteria.  The tax credits are non-refundable, but may be carried forward for seven years. If a small business utilizes alternative relief options, such as grants or subsidies, to offset their increase in employer contributions, the small business would not be eligible for the bills tax credits.
