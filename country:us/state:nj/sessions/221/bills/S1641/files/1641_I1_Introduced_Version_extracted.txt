Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, should take the lead in expanding educational resources to support working people at a time of extreme inequality, and when the workforce is going through a major shift including mass withdrawal from labor market participation, increased strike activity, new organizing, and changing workplace dynamics.  This is a key time where labor and management need to cooperate to find common ground, just as it was in 1947.  Therefore, on this, its 75th anniversary, we reaffirm the establishment in 1947 at the State University of New Jersey an Institute of Management and Labor Relations. 2.    The purpose of this act is to promote harmony and cooperation between management and labor and foster a greater understanding of industrial and labor relations and other work-related issues, thereby enhancing the unity and welfare of the people of the State. 3.    a.  The Institute of Management and Labor Relations, through its extension division, shall continue to establish at convenient centers throughout the State and remote programs of instruction designed to achieve the purposes set forth in section 2 of this act, and to bring about, among management, labor, and the public, better understanding of their mutual problems and obligations. b.    These programs of instruction may consist of instruction given in classes or by means of lectures, conferences, institutes, demonstrations, forums, webinars, or other informal educational services found to be particularly effective in teaching adults. c.     Tuition for all extension instruction in the Institute of Management and Labor Relations extension programs shall be affordable and, when possible, free to residents of New Jersey.  The Institute of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, may establish a registration fee or other incidental fees in connection with the operation of the educational activities. 4.    The Institute of Management and Labor Relations shall continue to conduct applied research in the field of labor-management relations and on other work and employment-related issues in order to identify and analyze problems and develop educational and policy solutions to those problems. 5.    Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey shall continue to appoint an advisory council for the Institute of Management and Labor Relations consisting of representatives of labor, management, and the public, in equal numbers.  The advisory council shall advise Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey as to the manner of carrying out the purposes of this act.  Members of the advisory council shall serve without compensation but shall receive reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses. 6.    There is appropriated from the General Fund an amount not to exceed $750,000 annually for the Institute of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, which amount shall be used to fund the requirements of this act. These funds shall augment and not replace the portion of State funds allocated to the budget of the Institute of Management and Labor Relations under the universitys budgeting model. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reaffirms the importance of the continuation of the Rutgers University Institute of Management and Labor Relations on its 75th anniversary.  As the United States is in the midst of major shifts in the labor force, it is a pivotal time to continue to expand educational resources on labor and management practices. The changing New Jersey economy will be built upon a skilled and educated workforce; therefore, this bill invests in the future wellbeing of New Jersey. The funds that this bill appropriates allows the Institute of Management and Labor Relations to continue its educational programs, such as classes, lectures, conferences and forums. The tuition for the educational programs is to be affordable to all, with the goal of the programs being free for New Jersey residents.  The Institute is to continue to conduct applied research on labor-management relations issues.  An advisory council is to manage the advisement of the programs and research that the Institute administers.  Rutgers University is to appoint the members of the advisory council and it will consist of representatives from the labor, management and public communities.
