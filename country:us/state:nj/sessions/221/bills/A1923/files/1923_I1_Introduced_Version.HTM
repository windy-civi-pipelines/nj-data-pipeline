If a hearing is not requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35 calendar day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order.  The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this subsection in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate.  A civil administrative penalty assessed, including a portion thereof required to be paid pursuant to a payment schedule approved by the department, which is not paid within 90 days of the date that payment of the penalty is due, shall be subject to an interest charge on the amount of the penalty, or portion thereof, which shall accrue as of the date payment is due.  If the penalty is contested, an additional interest charge shall not accrue on the amount of the penalty until 90 days after the date on which a final order is issued.  Interest charges assessed and collectible pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the rate of interest on judgments provided in the New Jersey Rules of Court. c.     Any owner or operator of a high hazard train who violates the provisions of P.L.      , c. (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or who fails to pay in full a civil administrative penalty levied pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or who fails to make a payment pursuant to a penalty payment schedule entered into with the department, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement, representation, or certification on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 for each day during which the violation continues.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected, and any costs incurred in connection therewith may be recovered, in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  In addition to any penalties, costs or interest charges, the court may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). d.    The owner or operator of a high hazard train that experiences a discharge shall be subject to the penalty and injunctive relief  provisions of section 22 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11u). 11.  Whenever information is received by the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management pursuant to United States Department of Transportation Emergency Order Docket No. DOT-OST-2014-0067, or any law, rule, regulation, or order that shall supersede that order, or pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management shall provide that information to each county office of emergency management and emergency services provider having jurisdiction along the travel route of a high hazard train. 12.  In accordance with the federal regulations promulgated pursuant to section 11405 of the federal Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act, Pub.L.114-94, the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall, at least annually and whenever the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall deem necessary, request from the United States Secretary of Transportation a copy of the most recent bridge inspection report generated pursuant to the federal Fixing Americas Surface Transportation Act, Pub.L.114-94, for every bridge owned by a railroad or upon which a railroad is located.
