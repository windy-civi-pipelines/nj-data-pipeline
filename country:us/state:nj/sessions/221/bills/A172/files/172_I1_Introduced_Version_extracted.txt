Pursuant to section 4 of the bill, all information related to plans, locations, diagrams, procedures, drills, or other activity that is part of an established school safety and security plan or other security-related plan or emergency response intended to be used to ensure the safety and security of a school would not be made available to any individual or institution except law enforcement officials; school board members; employees of the school district or non-public school; and any other person or entity otherwise provided by law.            A person would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if he purposely or knowingly, without the express written permission of the superintendent of schools of the school district or the chief school administrator of the non-public school, or the chief law enforcement officer of the municipality in which the school is located or, if the municipality does not have a local police force, the Superintendent of State Police, films, records, or otherwise documents procedures, drills, or activity that is part of an established school safety and security plan, or other security-related plan or emergency response; or posts any information, video, or procedures on the Internet, social media, or makes public any plans, locations, diagrams, or procedures pursuant to an established school safety and security plan, or other security-related plan or emergency response, intended to be used to ensure the safety and security of the school.  The chief law enforcement officer or Superintendent of State Police would be required to notify the appropriate superintendent of schools of the school district or the chief school administrator of the non-public school if written permission is granted.  This subsection would not apply to law enforcement activities associated with the operation of, or planning or training for, school safety and security or emergency responsiveness, or to news coverage of an emergency. Under subsection a. of section 5 of the bill, a person would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if he purposely or knowingly stops, impedes, redirects, or otherwise interferes with an established route, operation, or function of a school bus, van, or transportation vehicle engaged in the transportation of children to or from school or a school-sponsored event. Pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of the bill, a person who, knowing he is not licensed or privileged to do so, enters an occupied school bus without the consent of the school bus driver or authorized school representative would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.  This section would not apply to the actions of law enforcement or other established emergency road or utility repair crews in response to emergency traffic conditions.
