Under the bill, the term acquire means to collect, obtain, generate, or store any information from a person through any means.  In contrast, the term disclose means to transmit, release, transfer, share, disseminate, distribute, make available, rent, sell, or otherwise communicate any information to a third party. The provisions of this bill would not apply to a health care provider that discloses or acquires the personal health information of a person to or from another health care provider for the purposes of medical treatment or medical diagnosis.  Moreover, nothing contained in the bill may be construed to limit, diminish, or abrogate the rights of a person under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and any regulations promulgated thereunder by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HIPAA) or the obligations of a health care provider or third party under HIPAA.
