<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.     The Advisory
Committee on Family Services and Communications is established in the Division
of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services.  The purpose
of the advisory committee shall be to identify, and work with division
leadership to redress, any inefficiencies, shortcomings, or other problems that
may be associated with the divisions outreach to, communications with, or
provision of appropriate services and supports to, the family members and legal
guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The advisory committee
shall be composed of nine members, as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the divisions Family
Outreach Liaison, the divisions Communications and Constituent Inquiries
Liaison, and the chair of the Family Advisory Council, or their designees, who
shall serve ex officio; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   six public members, to
be appointed by the Governor, including:  (a) two residents from Bergen, Essex,
Hudson, Morris, Passaic, Sussex, or Warren County, one of whom shall be a
family member of an individual with a developmental disability and one of whom
shall be the legal guardian of an individual with a developmental disability;
(b) two residents from Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset,
or Union County, one of whom shall be a family member of an individual with a
developmental disability and one of whom shall be the legal guardian of an
individual with a developmental disability; and (c) two residents from
Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, or Salem
County, one of whom shall be a family member of an individual with a
developmental disability and one of whom shall be the legal guardian of an
individual with a developmental disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The public members of
the advisory committee shall serve for terms of two years, except that, of the
members first appointed to the committee, three shall serve an initial term of
one year, and three shall serve an initial term of two years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Vacancies in the
membership of the advisory committee shall be filled in the same manner provided
for the original appointments.  Public members shall be eligible for
reappointment to the commission following the conclusion of their terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The advisory committee
shall organize as soon as practicable, but not more than 30 days after the
appointment of a majority of its members.  Upon its organization, the advisory
committee shall select a chairperson from among its membership, and the
chairperson shall appoint a secretary, who need not be a member of the advisory
committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The advisory committee
shall meet at the times and places designated by the chair, but not less than
twice per year.  The advisory committee may conduct business without a quorum,
but may only vote on recommendations when a quorum is present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The members of the
advisory committee shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for
travel and other miscellaneous expenses incurred in the necessary performance
of their duties, within the limits of funds made available to the advisory
committee for its purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The division shall
provide professional, stenographic, and clerical staff, support, and resources
to the advisory committee, as may be necessary to ensure the proper
effectuation of the committees duties under this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.     The Advisory
Committee on Family Services and Communications shall have the duty to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   provide the family
members and legal guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities with
comprehensive information, upon request, regarding:  (a) the nature and details

procedures, protocols, and practices; (b) the nature and type of services and
supports that are available from the division to assist the family members and
guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities; and (c) any proposed
or actualized changes in these areas;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   engage in the ongoing
evaluation of existing division systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and
practices that are used to facilitate the divisions outreach to, communications
with, and provision of services and supports to, the family members and legal
guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities, and determine the
extent to which those systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and practices,
or components thereof, are resulting in inefficiencies, ineffectiveness, or a
lack of transparency or responsiveness in association with the divisions
outreach to, communications with, or provision of services and supports to, the
family members or legal guardians of individuals with developmental
disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   solicit, receive, and
review complaints, suggestions, and recommendations from relevant organizations
and from the family members and legal guardians of individuals with

its systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and practices to more
efficiently, effectively, transparently, and respectfully serve and respond to
the needs, questions, and concerns of the family members and legal guardians of
individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   identify elements within
the divisions existing systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and practices
that can be improved or modernized, and other remedial actions that can be
undertaken by division staff, to redress the inefficiencies or other problems
identified pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)    recommend, and work
with division leadership to facilitate the implementation of, changes to the
divisions systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and practices, as may be
necessary to ensure that division staff is consistently engaging in efficient,
effective, responsive, and fully transparent outreach to, communications with,
and provision of appropriate services and supports to, the family members and
legal guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities. 
Recommendations developed pursuant to this paragraph shall be presented, in
writing, to the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Developmental Disabilities
in the Department of Human Services, within one year after the effective date
of this act and annually thereafter.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Advisory Committee on Family Services and Communications in the Division of
Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services.  The purpose of
the advisory committee will be to identify, and work with division leadership
to redress, any inefficiencies, shortcomings, or other problems that may be
associated with the divisions outreach to, communications with, or provision
of appropriate services and supports to, the family members and legal guardians
of individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The advisory committee is to
be composed of nine members, including the divisions Family Outreach Liaison

the Family Advisory Council, or their designees, who would serve ex officio,
and six public members to be appointed by the Governor.  The six public members

and southern regions of the State, who are family members of an individual with
a developmental disability; and 2) three residents, one from each of the

of an individual with a developmental disability.  The advisory committee will
be required to organize as soon as practicable, but not more than 30 days after
the appointment of a majority of its members.  </p>

changes in these areas;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    engage in the ongoing
evaluation of existing division systems, policies, procedures, protocols, and
practices that are used to facilitate the divisions outreach to,
communications with, and provision of services and supports to, the family
members and legal guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities, and
determine the extent to which those systems, policies, procedures, protocols,
and practices, or components thereof, are resulting in inefficiencies,
ineffectiveness, or a lack of transparency or responsiveness in association
with the divisions outreach to, communications with, or provision of services
and supports to, the family members or legal guardians of individuals with developmental
disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    solicit, receive, and

individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    identify elements within

and provision of appropriate services and supports to, the family members and
legal guardians of individuals with developmental disabilities. 
Recommendations developed by the committee are to be presented, in writing, to
the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the
Department of Human Services, within one year after the bills effective date
and annually thereafter.  </p>
