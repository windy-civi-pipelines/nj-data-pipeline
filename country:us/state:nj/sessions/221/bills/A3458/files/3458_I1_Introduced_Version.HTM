<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 2 of P.L.2021, c.444
(C.40:48-2.12s2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  (1)  A creditor
serving a summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage on
commercial property in the State shall, within 10 days of serving the summons
and complaint, notify the municipal clerk and the mayor or other chief
executive officer of the municipality in which the property is located that a
summons and complaint in an action to foreclose on a mortgage has been filed
against the subject property.  The notice shall contain the full name, address,
and telephone number for the representative of the creditor who is responsible
for receiving complaints of property maintenance and code violations and the
full name and contact information for any person or entity retained by the
creditor or a representative of the creditor to be responsible for any care,
maintenance, security, or upkeep of the property.  The notice may contain
information about more than one property, and shall be provided by mail or
electronic communication, at the discretion of the municipal clerk.  In the
event the creditor that has served a summons and complaint in an action to
foreclose on a commercial property that is located out-of-State, the notice
shall also contain the full name, address, and telephone number of an in-State
representative or agent who shall be responsible for the care, maintenance,
security, and upkeep of <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the
exterior of<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
the property if it becomes vacant and abandoned.  If the municipality has
designated or appointed a public officer pursuant to P.L.1942, c.112
(C.40:48-2.3 et seq.), the municipal clerk shall forward a copy of the notice
to the public officer or shall otherwise provide it to any other local official
responsible for administration of any property maintenance or public nuisance
code.  The notice shall also include the street address, lot, and block number
of the property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If there is any change in the
name, address, or telephone number for a representative, agent, or individual
authorized to accept service on behalf of a creditor required to be provided in
a notice pursuant to this paragraph following the filing of the summons and
complaint, the creditor shall provide a notice to the applicable municipal
clerk containing the updated name, address, or telephone number within 10 days
of the change in that information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Within 30 days following
the effective date of P.L.2021, c.444 (C.40:48-2.12s1 et al.), any creditor
that has initiated a foreclosure proceeding on any commercial property that is
pending in Superior Court shall provide to the municipal clerk of the
municipality in which the property is located, a listing of all commercial
properties in the municipality for which the creditor has foreclosure actions
pending by street address and lot and block number.  If the municipality has
designated or appointed a public officer pursuant to P.L.1942, c.112
(C.40:48-2.3 et seq.), the municipal clerk shall forward a copy of the notice
to the public officer, or shall otherwise provide it to any other local
official responsible for administration of any property maintenance or public
nuisance code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the owner of a
commercial property vacates or abandons any property on which a foreclosure
proceeding has been initiated or if a commercial property becomes vacant at any
point subsequent to the creditor's filing the summons and complaint in an
action to foreclose on a mortgage against the subject property, but prior to
vesting of title in the creditor or any other third party, and <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the exterior
of<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
the property is found to be a nuisance or in violation of any applicable State
or local code, the local public officer, municipal clerk, or other authorized
municipal official shall notify the creditor or the representative or agent of
an out-of-State creditor, as applicable, which shall have the responsibility to
abate the nuisance or correct the violation in the same manner and to the same
extent as the title owner of the property, to such standard or specification as
may be required by State law or municipal ordinance.  The municipality shall
include a description of the conditions that gave rise to the violation with
the notice of violation and shall provide a period of not less than 30 days
from the creditor's receipt of the notice for the creditor to remedy the
violation.  If the creditor fails to remedy the violation within that time
period, the municipality may impose penalties allowed for the violation of
municipal ordinances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the municipality
expends public funds in order to abate a nuisance or correct a violation on a commercial
property in situations in which the creditor was given notice pursuant to the
provisions of subsection b. of this section but failed to abate the nuisance or
correct the violation as directed, the municipality shall have the same
recourse against the creditor as it would have against the title owner of the
property, including, but not limited to, the recourse provided under section 23
of P.L.2003, c.210 (C.55:19-100).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For the purposes of this
section, &quot;creditor&quot; means a State-chartered bank, savings bank,
savings and loan association or credit union, any person required to be
licensed under the provisions of the &quot;New Jersey Residential Mortgage
Lending Act,&quot; sections 1 through 39 of P.L.2009, c.53 (C.17:11C-51 through
C.17:11C-89), and any entity acting on behalf of the creditor named in the debt
obligation including, but not limited to, servicers.  For purposes of this
section, a creditor shall not include the State, a political subdivision of the
State, or a State, county, or local government entity, or their agent or
assignee, such as the servicer.</p>

filed by the creditor; and (2) an additional $2,000 per property annually if
the property is vacant or abandoned pursuant to the definition in the ordinance
when the summons and complaint in an action to foreclose is filed, or becomes
vacant and abandoned pursuant to the definition in the ordinance at any time
thereafter while the property is in foreclosure.  All such annual fees and the

the municipality and the third-party entity.  Amounts collected by the
third-party entity on behalf of the local unit shall be paid over in full to

all such funds within 48 hours after the receipt thereof to the credit of the
municipality in its designated legal depository.  A third-party entity shall
collect and pay over to the municipality any interest and penalties, based upon
the rate of interest and penalties fixed by the governing body of the
municipality for late payment of property taxes, assessments, and other
municipal charges pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, for late payment of the property
registration fees imposed pursuant to subsection e. of this section and an

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require
creditors to maintain the interior of vacant and abandoned residential property
under foreclosure.  Current law only requires creditors to maintain the
exterior of vacant and abandoned residential property under foreclosure.  The
interiors of vacant and abandoned residential properties present a host of
serious maintenance issues to neighbors.  For instance, mold, vermin, and fire
hazards can easily affect neighbors, particularly in the case of attached
housing.  This bill would extend creditors responsibility to maintain vacant
and abandoned residential property under foreclosure to include the interior of
such property in order to protect neighbors and to prevent municipalities from
bearing such maintenance costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also allow municipalities
to adopt ordinances providing for a fine of $1,500 for each day a maintenance
violation concerning the interior of a vacant and abandoned residential
property under foreclosure goes uncorrected following a 30-day window to
correct, or a 10-day window to correct in the case of an imminent threat to
public health and safety.  Current law only allows municipalities to adopt
ordinances providing for such penalties with respect to the exterior of vacant
and abandoned residential property under foreclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the deadlines
for correcting interior violations may be extended if a court order is needed
to enter a property to make such corrections. </p>
