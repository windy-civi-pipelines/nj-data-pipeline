(cf: P.L.1985, c.174, s.5) 14.  Section 5 of P.L.1988, c.110 (C.40A:9-140.10) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, in every municipality there shall be a chief financial officer appointed by the governing body of the municipality.

(2)  The municipal governing body may authorize, by resolution, an estimated annual tax levy for the county and each such taxing district by setting an amount within the range computed by the tax collector in consultation with the chief financial officer. b.  An estimated bill for the third installment of taxes may be calculated as follows: (1)  The tax rate for the county and each taxing district shall be calculated by dividing the certified, if available, or estimated tax levy by the current year net valuation taxable. Each such tax rate shall be multiplied by the taxable value for each property to arrive at the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed. (2)  The amount charged in the first and second installments of the current year shall be subtracted from the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed.  That amount shall then be divided in half and after being so divided shall be the amount of the estimated tax bill for the third installment of taxes. c.  A reconciled bill for the fourth installment of taxes shall be calculated as follows: (1)  The tax rate for the county and each taxing district shall be calculated by dividing the actual tax levies certified by the county board of taxation by the current year net valuation taxable.

(cf: P.L.1994, c.72, s.5) 22.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the 13th month next following the date of enactment and shall apply to the next local fiscal year beginning after that date. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to local unit budget processes and related operations. The bill extends statutory deadlines for: (1)  the mayor or municipal manager, as applicable, to submit a recommended budget to the council of a municipality from January 15 to February 28 of the calendar fiscal year; (2)  the governing body of a local unit to introduce and approve the annual budget from January 26 to March 31 for a county and February 10 to March 31 for a municipality operating on a calendar fiscal year.  The bill also provides that a governing body of any municipality or county may introduce and approve the annual budget at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body after the dates specified in the statute; (3)  to adopt the annual budget from February 25 to April 30 for a county and March 20 to April 30 for a municipality operating on a calendar fiscal year.  The bill also provides that a governing body of any municipality or county may introduce and approve the annual budget at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body after the dates specified in the statute; (4)  the annual audit of a municipality or county from six months to eight months after the close of the fiscal year; and (5)  the annual statement on the financial condition of the local unit from February 10 to March 10 for municipalities operating on a calendar fiscal year. The bill also establishes a 90-day deadline and clarifies procedures to fill vacancies in the following roles with budget-related responsibilities: municipal chief financial officer, county chief financial officer, municipal tax collector, municipal clerk, and principal public works manager.  In certain circumstances, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services (director) in the Department of Community Affairs would be permitted to extend the 90-day deadline. Additionally, under current law, members of a local unit governing body are subject to a personal penalty of $25 for failure or refusal to comply with certain statutory responsibilities related to local unit budget processes and operation of a local unit.  The bill would increase the personal penalty to $100 for these violations and establish a personal penalty of $100 for failure or refusal to comply with additional existing requirements. For counties and municipalities operating on a calendar fiscal year, the bill also increases the permissible amount of a temporary budget, which is adopted in the first month of the fiscal year and in effect for approximately three months, from 26.25 percent to 35 percent of the previous years total appropriations. Under current law, the governing body or chief executive officer of any municipality may request a review by the director of the behavior or practices of certain individuals serving the local unit in a professional capacity.  The bill allows the director to initiate a review of the behavior or practices of the following: registered municipal clerk, certified tax collector, certified public works manager, and qualified purchasing agent. Finally, the bill allows the director to authorize an extension of the statutory deadlines for municipalities to mail estimated property tax bills upon good cause shown and upon terms or conditions the directors deems reasonable. The bill would be effective on the first day of the 13th month next following enactment and would apply to the next local fiscal year beginning after that date.

In the case of a pilot municipality, a tenured chief financial officer may be dismissed to effectuate the sharing of a service entered into pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 et seq.) and such dismissal shall be deemed to be in the interest of the economy or efficiency of the participants in the shared service agreement.  The removal of a chief financial officer under this section shall not require the pilot municipality to fulfill the requirements of section 2 of P.L.1977, c.39 (C.40A:9-140.8).  Instead, the pilot municipality shall provide the chief financial officer with a written copy of the shared service agreement entered into by the pilot municipality, and a letter stating that the position of chief financial officer in the pilot municipality is being eliminated for reasons of economy or efficiency as the result of the shared service agreement. b.    The requirement that every municipality shall have a chief financial officer may be temporarily fulfilled by the appointment of a private entity to perform the duties of a chief financial officer.  A municipality shall not appoint a private entity to fulfill the duties of a chief financial officer for more than two consecutive one-year terms.  A municipality shall not make such appointment or reappointment unless approved by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  Such approval shall only be granted if the municipality demonstrates that it has made a good faith effort to hire an individual who holds a municipal finance officer certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1971, c.413 (C.40A:9-140.1 et seq.). The term of office of a private entity appointed pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed two consecutive years.  Any work performed by such private entity on behalf of the municipality shall be supervised by at least one employee who holds a municipal finance officer certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1971, c.413 (C.40A:9-140.1 et seq.).  Any documents requiring signature of the chief financial officer of the municipality shall be executed on behalf of the private entity by an employee holding a municipal finance officer certificate. c.  Within 90 days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of chief financial officer, unless an extension is granted by the director upon written request by the governing body or chief executive officer, the governing body shall appoint an individual with a municipal finance officer certificate issued pursuant to P.L.1971, c.413 (C.40A:9-140.1 et seq.) to serve as chief financial officer; or if a vacancy occurs in the office of chief financial officer following the appointment of a certified municipal finance officer to that office, appoint a person who does not hold a municipal finance officer certificate to serve as a temporary chief financial officer pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1988, c.110 (C.40A:9-140.13); or if otherwise permitted under subsection b. of this section and such regulations as may be adopted by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services appoint a private entity to temporarily perform the duties of a chief financial officer subject to director approval.  In lieu of an appointment pursuant to this section, a shared service agreement with another municipality or municipalities may be entered into pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-4).  The director may approve an extension to the 90-day period upon good cause shown and the municipality having demonstrated its inability to fill the vacancy in the office despite having made a good faith effort to do so. (cf: P.L.2015, c.95, s.23) 15.  N.J.S.40A:9-141 is amended to read as follows: 40A:9-141.  a.  Notwithstanding any other law the governing body or chief executive officer, as shall be appropriate to the form of government of the municipality, by ordinance, shall provide for the appointment of a municipal tax collector and the compensation of the tax collector shall be fixed in the manner otherwise provided by law.

(2)  The municipal governing body may authorize, by resolution, an estimated annual tax levy for the county and each such taxing district by setting an amount within the range computed by the tax collector in consultation with the chief financial officer. b.  An estimated bill for the third installment of taxes may be calculated as follows: (1)  The tax rate for the county and each taxing district shall be calculated by dividing the certified, if available, or estimated tax levy by the current year net valuation taxable. Each such tax rate shall be multiplied by the taxable value for each property to arrive at the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed. (2)  The amount charged in the first and second installments of the current year shall be subtracted from the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed.  That amount shall then be divided in half and after being so divided shall be the amount of the estimated tax bill for the third installment of taxes. c.  A reconciled bill for the fourth installment of taxes shall be calculated as follows: (1)  The tax rate for the county and each taxing district shall be calculated by dividing the actual tax levies certified by the county board of taxation by the current year net valuation taxable.

(3)  A reconciled bill for the second installment of taxes shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection e. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), except that the billing amount shall be the true amount calculated pursuant to law, less the amount billed in the estimated first installment. (4)  The first installment of taxes shall not be subject to interest until the later of February 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or estimated tax bill for the first installment was mailed or otherwise delivered.  Any payment received after the later of February 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or estimated tax bill for the first installment was mailed or otherwise delivered may be charged interest back to February 1.  The estimated tax bill shall contain a notice specifying the date on which interest may begin to accrue.

(2)  The municipal governing body may authorize, by resolution, an estimated annual tax levy for the county and each such taxing district by setting an amount within the range computed by the tax collector in consultation with the chief financial officer.  The municipal levy shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection e. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1). (3)  The tax rate for the county and each taxing district shall be calculated by dividing each estimated tax levy by the current year total net valuation taxable.  Each such tax rate shall be multiplied by the net valuation taxable for each property to arrive at the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed. (4)  The amount charged in the first and second installments of the current year shall be subtracted from the estimated annual property tax due for each property assessed.  That amount shall then be divided in half and after being so divided shall be the amount of the estimated tax bill for the third installment of taxes. (5)  For the fourth installment of taxes, the tax rate for the county and each non-municipal taxing district shall be calculated by dividing the actual tax levies certified by the county board of taxation by the current year total net valuation taxable.  The municipal tax rate shall be that used in paragraph (3) of this subsection. Each such tax rate shall be multiplied by the net valuation taxable for each property to arrive at the actual annual property tax due for each property assessed.  The amount charged in the first, second and third installments of the current year for each taxing district shall be subtracted from the actual annual property tax due for the county and each taxing district for each property assessed.  The difference of those amounts shall constitute the amount of the reconciled tax bill for the fourth installment of property tax. (6)  The third installment of taxes shall not be subject to interest until the later of August 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or estimated tax bill for the third installment was mailed or otherwise delivered.  Any payment received after the later of August 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or estimated tax bill for the third installment was mailed or otherwise delivered may be charged interest back to August 1.  The estimated tax bill shall contain a notice specifying the date on which interest may begin to accrue. (7)  The fourth installment of taxes shall not be subject to interest until the later of November 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or reconciled tax bill for the fourth installment was mailed or otherwise delivered.  Any payment received after the later of November 1, the additional interest-free period authorized pursuant to R.S.54:4-67, or the twenty-fifth calendar day after the date that the tax bill or estimated tax bill for the fourth installment was mailed or otherwise delivered may be charged interest back to November 1.  The reconciled tax bill shall contain a notice specifying the date on which interest may begin to accrue. d.  If the tax collector in consultation with the chief financial officer determines that the municipality is unable to calculate the tax bills utilizing the formulas set forth in this section, the collector in consultation with the chief financial officer may request the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to authorize an alternate method that will result in the most accurate bills possible utilizing the mechanisms available to the municipality.  The director shall certify in writing the method approved for billings. e.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may authorize a municipality to mail estimated tax bills after December 31 for the first installment of taxes or June 30 for the third installment of taxes upon good cause being shown and upon the terms or conditions the director may deem reasonable.  The determination of the director in the granting of an extension is final. (cf: P.L.1994, c.72, s.5) 22.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the 13th month next following the date of enactment and shall apply to the next local fiscal year beginning after that date. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to local unit budget processes and related operations. The bill extends statutory deadlines for: (1)  the mayor or municipal manager, as applicable, to submit a recommended budget to the council of a municipality from January 15 to February 28 of the calendar fiscal year; (2)  the governing body of a local unit to introduce and approve the annual budget from January 26 to March 31 for a county and February 10 to March 31 for a municipality operating on a calendar fiscal year.  The bill also provides that a governing body of any municipality or county may introduce and approve the annual budget at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body after the dates specified in the statute; (3)  to adopt the annual budget from February 25 to April 30 for a county and March 20 to April 30 for a municipality operating on a calendar fiscal year.  The bill also provides that a governing body of any municipality or county may introduce and approve the annual budget at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body after the dates specified in the statute; (4)  the annual audit of a municipality or county from six months to eight months after the close of the fiscal year; and (5)  the annual statement on the financial condition of the local unit from February 10 to March 10 for municipalities operating on a calendar fiscal year. The bill also establishes a 90-day deadline and clarifies procedures to fill vacancies in the following roles with budget-related responsibilities: municipal chief financial officer, county chief financial officer, municipal tax collector, municipal clerk, and principal public works manager.  In certain circumstances, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services (director) in the Department of Community Affairs would be permitted to extend the 90-day deadline. Additionally, under current law, members of a local unit governing body are subject to a personal penalty of $25 for failure or refusal to comply with certain statutory responsibilities related to local unit budget processes and operation of a local unit.  The bill would increase the personal penalty to $100 for these violations and establish a personal penalty of $100 for failure or refusal to comply with additional existing requirements. For counties and municipalities operating on a calendar fiscal year, the bill also increases the permissible amount of a temporary budget, which is adopted in the first month of the fiscal year and in effect for approximately three months, from 26.25 percent to 35 percent of the previous years total appropriations. Under current law, the governing body or chief executive officer of any municipality may request a review by the director of the behavior or practices of certain individuals serving the local unit in a professional capacity.  The bill allows the director to initiate a review of the behavior or practices of the following: registered municipal clerk, certified tax collector, certified public works manager, and qualified purchasing agent. Finally, the bill allows the director to authorize an extension of the statutory deadlines for municipalities to mail estimated property tax bills upon good cause shown and upon terms or conditions the directors deems reasonable. The bill would be effective on the first day of the 13th month next following enactment and would apply to the next local fiscal year beginning after that date.
