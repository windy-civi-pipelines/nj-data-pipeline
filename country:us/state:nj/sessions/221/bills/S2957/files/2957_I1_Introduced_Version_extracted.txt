Within six months of the issuance of the report, the corporation is required to adopt any individual policies and best practices recommended in the report.  Under the bill, the corporation is permitted to opt not to adopt an individual policy or best practice, provided that the corporation provides a detailed explanation of why the adoption of that policy or practice is not in the best interest of the corporation within six months of the issuance of the report issued by the independent firm. This bill does not affect any obligation of the corporation to conduct, or hire an independent firm to complete, an audit or study under existing law.
