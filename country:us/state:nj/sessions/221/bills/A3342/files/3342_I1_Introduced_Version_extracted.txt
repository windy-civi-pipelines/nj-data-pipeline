MCGUCKIN District 10 (Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Requires health care practitioners prescribing opioid medications to limit amount of prescribed medication to seven-day supply, except in certain circumstances. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning prescriptions for opioid medications, amending P.L.1997, c.249, and supplementing Title 24 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. Section 11 of P.L.2017, c.28 (C.24:21-15.2) is amended to read as follows: 11. a. A practitioner shall not issue [an initial] a prescription for an opioid drug which is a prescription drug as defined in section 2 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-41) in a quantity exceeding a [five-day] seven-day supply for treatment of acute pain.  Any prescription for acute pain pursuant to this subsection shall be for the lowest effective dose of immediate-release opioid drug. b.    Prior to issuing an initial prescription of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance or any other opioid drug which is a prescription drug as defined in section 2 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-41) in a course of treatment for acute or chronic pain, a practitioner shall: (1)   take and document the results of a thorough medical history, including the patient's experience with non-opioid medication and non-pharmacological pain management approaches and substance abuse history; (2)   conduct, as appropriate, and document the results of a physical examination; (3)   develop a treatment plan, with particular attention focused on determining the cause of the patient's pain; (4)   access relevant prescription monitoring information under the Prescription Monitoring Program pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2015, c.74 (C. 45:1-46.1); and (5)   limit the supply of any opioid drug prescribed for acute pain to a duration of no more than [five] seven days as determined by the directed dosage and frequency of dosage. c.     No less than [four] six days after issuing [the initial] a prescription pursuant to subsection a. of this subsection, the practitioner, after consultation with the patient, may issue a subsequent prescription for the drug to the patient [in any quantity that complies with applicable State and federal laws] in a quantity not exceeding a seven-day supply, provided that: (1)   [the subsequent prescription would not be deemed an initial prescription under this section]     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.   , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)[;] (2) the practitioner determines the prescription is necessary and appropriate to the patient's treatment needs and documents the rationale for the issuance of the subsequent prescription; and (3) the practitioner determines that issuance of the subsequent prescription does not present an undue risk of abuse, addiction, or diversion and documents that determination. d.    Prior to issuing [the initial] a prescription of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance or any other opioid drug which is a prescription drug as defined in section 2 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-41) in a course of treatment for acute pain and prior to issuing a prescription at the outset of a course of treatment for chronic pain, a practitioner shall discuss with the patient, or the patient's parent or guardian if the patient is under 18 years of age and is not an emancipated minor, the risks associated with the drugs being prescribed, including but not limited to: (1) the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid drugs and the dangers of taking opioid drugs with alcohol, benzodiazepines and other central nervous system depressants; (2) the reasons why the prescription is necessary; (3) alternative treatments that may be available; and (4) risks associated with the use of the drugs being prescribed, specifically that opioids are highly addictive, even when taken as prescribed, that there is a risk of developing a physical or psychological dependence on the controlled dangerous substance, and that the risks of taking more opioids than prescribed, or mixing sedatives, benzodiazepines or alcohol with opioids, can result in fatal respiratory depression. The practitioner shall include a note in the patient's medical record that the patient or the patient's parent or guardian, as applicable, has discussed with the practitioner the risks of developing a physical or psychological dependence on the controlled dangerous substance and alternative treatments that may be available.  The Division of Consumer Affairs shall develop and make available to practitioners guidelines for the discussion required pursuant to this subsection. e.     Prior to the commencement of an ongoing course of treatment for chronic pain with a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance or any opioid, the practitioner shall enter into a pain management agreement with the patient. f.     When a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance or any other prescription opioid drug is continuously prescribed for three months or more for chronic pain, the practitioner shall: (1) review, at a minimum of every three months, the course of treatment, any new information about the etiology of the pain, and the patient's progress toward treatment objectives and document the results of that review; (2) assess the patient prior to every renewal to determine whether the patient is experiencing problems associated with physical and psychological dependence and document the results of that assessment; (3) periodically make reasonable efforts, unless clinically contraindicated, to either stop the use of the controlled substance, decrease the dosage, try other drugs or treatment modalities in an effort to reduce the potential for abuse or the development of physical or psychological dependence and document with specificity the efforts undertaken; (4) review the Prescription Drug Monitoring information in accordance with section 8 of P.L.2015, c.74 (C. 45:1-46.1); and (5) monitor compliance with the pain management agreement and any recommendations that the patient seek a referral. g.    As used in this section: "Acute pain" means pain, whether resulting from disease, accidental or intentional trauma, or other cause, that the practitioner reasonably expects to last only a short period of time.  "Acute pain" does not include chronic pain, pain being treated as part of cancer care, hospice or other end of life care, or pain being treated as part of palliative care. "Chronic pain" means pain that persists or recurs for more than three months. ["Initial prescription" means a prescription issued to a patient who: (1) has never previously been issued a prescription for the drug or its pharmaceutical equivalent; or (2) was previously issued a prescription for, or used or was administered the drug or its pharmaceutical equivalent, but the date on which the current prescription is being issued is more than one year after the date the patient last used or was administered the drug or its equivalent. When determining whether a patient was previously issued a prescription for, or used or was administered a drug or its pharmaceutical equivalent, the practitioner shall consult with the patient and review the patient's medical record and prescription monitoring information.] "Opioid antidote" means any drug, regardless of dosage amount or method of administration, which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of an opioid overdose.  "Opioid antidote" includes, but is not limited to, naloxone hydrochloride, in any dosage amount, which is administered through nasal spray or any other FDA-approved means or methods. "Pain management agreement" means a written contract or agreement that is executed between a practitioner and a patient, prior to the commencement of treatment for chronic pain using a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance or any other opioid drug which is a prescription drug as defined in section 2 of P.L.2003, c.280 (C.45:14-41), as a means to: (1) prevent the possible development of physical or psychological dependence in the patient; (2) document the understanding of both the practitioner and the patient regarding the patient's pain management plan; (3) establish the patient's rights in association with treatment, and the patient's obligations in relation to the responsible use, discontinuation of use, and storage of Schedule II controlled dangerous substances, including any restrictions on the refill of prescriptions or the acceptance of Schedule II prescriptions from practitioners; (4) identify the specific medications and other modes of treatment, including physical therapy or exercise, relaxation, or psychological counseling, that are included as a part of the pain management plan; (5) specify the measures the practitioner may employ to monitor the patient's compliance, including but not limited to random specimen screens and pill counts; and (6) delineate the process for terminating the agreement, including the consequences if the practitioner has reason to believe that the patient is not complying with the terms of the agreement. "Practitioner" means a medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, dentist, optometrist, podiatrist, physician assistant, certified nurse midwife, or advanced practice nurse, acting within the scope of practice of their professional license pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. h.    (1) This section shall not apply to a prescription for a patient who is currently in active treatment for cancer, receiving hospice care from a licensed hospice or palliative care, or is a resident of a long term care facility, or to any medications that are being prescribed for use in the treatment of substance abuse or opioid dependence. (2) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if a practitioner determines, in the practitioners professional medical judgment, that the prescription of more than a seven-day supply of opioid medication is necessary to treat a patients acute medical condition, or is necessary to provide the patient with adequate management of chronic pain, the practitioner may issue a prescription of more than a seven-day supply of opioid medication.  The quantity of opioid medication prescribed under this subsection shall not exceed the amounts specified in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.249 (C.45:9-22.19), and shall be consistent with any other applicable State and federal prescribing requirements.  The condition triggering the prescription of more than a seven-day supply of opioid medication shall be documented in the patients medical record, and the practitioner shall also indicate therein that a non-opioid alternative was not appropriate to treat the medical condition. i.     Every policy, contract or plan delivered, issued, executed or renewed in this State, or approved for issuance or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and every contract purchased by the School Employees' Health Benefits Commission or State Health Benefits Commission, on or after the effective date of this act, that provides coverage for prescription drugs subject to a co-payment, coinsurance or deductible shall charge a co-payment, coinsurance or deductible for an initial prescription of an opioid drug prescribed pursuant to this section that is either: (1)   proportional between the cost sharing for a 30-day supply and the amount of drugs the patient was prescribed; or (2)   equivalent to the cost sharing for a full 30-day supply of the opioid drug, provided that no additional cost sharing may be charged for any additional prescriptions for the remainder of the 30-day supply. j. (1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, if a health care practitioner issues a prescription for an opioid drug which is a controlled dangerous substance to a patient, the prescriber shall additionally issue the patient a prescription for an opioid antidote if any of the following conditions is present: (a)   the patient has a history of substance use disorder; (b)   the prescription for the opioid drug is for a daily dose of more than 90 morphine milligram equivalents; or (c)   the patient holds a current, valid prescription for a benzodiazepine drug that is a Schedule III or Schedule IV controlled dangerous substance. (2) A practitioner shall not be required to issue more than one prescription for an opioid antidote to a patient under paragraph (1) of this subsection per year. (3) Nothing in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a practitioner from issuing additional prescriptions for an opioid antidote to a patient upon the patient's request or when the practitioner determines there is a clinical or practical need for the additional prescription. (cf: P.L.2021, c.54, s.1) 2.    Section 1 of P.L.1997, c.249 (C.45:9-22.19) is amended to read as follows: 1. a. [Except in the case of an initial prescription issued pursuant to] Subject to the limitations set forth in section 11 of P.L.2017, c.28 (C.24:21-15.2), a physician licensed pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes may prescribe a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance for the use of a patient in any quantity which does not exceed a 30-day supply, as defined by regulations adopted by the State Board of Medical Examiners in consultation with the Department of Health. The physician shall document the diagnosis and the medical need for the prescription in the patient's medical record, in accordance with guidelines established by the State Board of Medical Examiners. b.    [Except in the case of an initial prescription issued pursuant to] Subject to the limitations set forth in section 11 of P.L.2017, c.28 (C.24:21-15.2), a physician may issue multiple prescriptions authorizing the patient to receive a total of up to a 90-day supply of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance, provided that the following conditions are met: (1)   each separate prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose by the physician acting in the usual course of professional practice; (2)   the physician provides written instructions on each prescription, other than the first prescription if it is to be filled immediately, indicating the earliest date on which a pharmacy may fill each prescription; (3)   the physician determines that providing the patient with multiple prescriptions in this manner does not create an undue risk of diversion or abuse; and (4)   the physician complies with all other applicable State and federal laws and regulations. (cf: P.L.2017, c.28, s.12) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides certain limits on the amount of opioid medication that may be prescribed to a patient. Under the bill, whenever a health care practitioner or physician prescribes an opioid medication to a patient, the health care practitioner or physician is to be prohibited from prescribing more than a seven-day supply of the medication.  However, if a health care practitioner or physician determines, in his or her professional judgment, that the prescription of more than a seven-day supply of opioid medication is necessary to treat a patients acute medical condition, or is necessary to provide the patient with adequate management of chronic pain, the practitioner may issue a prescription of more than a seven-day supply of opioid medication. The quantity of opioid medication prescribed under this bill is not to exceed the amounts specified in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.249 (C.45:9-22.19), and is to be consistent with any other applicable State and federal prescribing requirements.
