<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
reappointment process for administrative law judges, and establish tenure upon
reappointment with the Senates advice and consent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, whenever the
Governor nominates an administrative law judge for reappointment, such
reappointment is for a term of five years and until the appointment and
qualification of the judges successor (either a new judge or the judge
succeeding him- or herself).  A judge can be reappointed to multiple five-year
terms until attaining the age of 70 years, at which time the judge faces
mandatory retirement.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, any judge
nominated for reappointment on or after the bills effective date (the first
day of the second month next following enactment) would be eligible for
lifetime tenure until attaining the age of mandatory retirement.  In order for
the Senate to make a more informed decision about granting lifetime tenure, the
judicial evaluations of tenure-eligible nominees would be made available to the
Senate Judiciary Committee for review as part of the Senates advice and
consent process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill changes
the references to the Director and Chief Administrative Law Judge and Director/Chief
Administrative Law Judge to only reference the director position in order to
make this reference consistent throughout the relevant statutory sections, as
there are a multitude of references just to the director.  Per section 3 of
P.L.1978, c.67 (C.52:14F-3), the term director as used in those sections
means the Director of the Office of Administrative Law and Chief
Administrative Law Judge, thus only the reference to the director is needed. </p>
