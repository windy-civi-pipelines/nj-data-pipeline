Misconduct by any party, attorney or representative of a party or witness which obstructs or tends to obstruct the conduct of a contested case or the failure of any witness, when duly subpoenaed to attend, give testimony or produce any record, or the failure to pay any sanction assessed pursuant to subsection t. of this section, shall be punishable by the Superior Court in the same manner as such failure is punishable by such court in a case pending therein; v.    Assign any judge recalled pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1978, c.67 (C.52:14F-4) and fix the per diem allowance; w.   Assign an administrative law judge or other personnel to conduct arbitration, mediation, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution with regard to any contested case or any proceeding other than that related to a contested case or administrative adjudication; and x.    Schedule hearings in an expeditious and efficient manner taking into account the significance of the issues, the needs of the parties, available resources, costs to the parties, and other relevant factors.  The director may, on a temporary basis when required by exigent circumstances, schedule hearings notwithstanding deadlines otherwise set forth in statute. (cf: P.L.2013, c.236, s.3) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would revise the reappointment process for administrative law judges, and establish tenure upon reappointment with the Senates advice and consent. Currently, whenever the Governor nominates an administrative law judge for reappointment, such reappointment is for a term of five years and until the appointment and qualification of the judges successor (either a new judge or the judge succeeding him- or herself).  A judge can be reappointed to multiple five-year terms until attaining the age of 70 years, at which time the judge faces mandatory retirement. Under the bill, any judge nominated for reappointment on or after the bills effective date (the first day of the second month next following enactment) would be eligible for lifetime tenure until attaining the age of mandatory retirement.  In order for the Senate to make a more informed decision about granting lifetime tenure, the judicial evaluations of tenure-eligible nominees would be made available to the Senate Judiciary Committee for review as part of the Senates advice and consent process. Additionally, the bill changes the references to the Director and Chief Administrative Law Judge and Director/Chief Administrative Law Judge to only reference the director position in order to make this reference consistent throughout the relevant statutory sections, as there are a multitude of references just to the director.  Per section 3 of P.L.1978, c.67 (C.52:14F-3), the term director as used in those sections means the Director of the Office of Administrative Law and Chief Administrative Law Judge, thus only the reference to the director is needed.
