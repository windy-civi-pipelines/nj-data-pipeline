<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits, supplementing
Title 4 of the Revised Statutes, amending P.L.1941, c.151, and repealing
various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that it is an important public policy to support
the adoption of homeless animals from animal rescue organizations, animal
shelters, and pounds; that consumers have the right to choose responsible
breeders from whom to purchase healthy cats, dogs, or rabbits; that despite the
consumer protections enacted by the State, pet shops continue to obtain
unhealthy cats and dogs from kitten and puppy mills; that with so many
adoptable cats and dogs available, it is unnecessary to have pet shops continue
to sell cats or dogs; and that rabbits continue to be sold by pet shops in the
spring and often end up abandoned at animal rescues, shelters, or pounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature furthermore
finds and declares that responsible breeders are ones that do not engage in
disreputable practices such as selling puppies sight unseen; that responsible
dog breeders can play a vital role in the effort to stop  the mistreatment that
occurs at puppy mills by offering guidance on the humane breeding and care of
dogs and puppies, and educate prospective buyers about the importance of 
humane breeding and care; that responsible breeders are attentive to the health
of their animals, scrutinize pedigrees, test for genetic disease, and breed animals
in order to improve the health and well-being of offspring in the animals
blood lines; that responsible breeders keep adult animals and the offspring in quarters
that allow for optimal exercise; that they feed the animals nutritious foods
and provide appropriate general and veterinary care; that they interview
prospective owners and sell kittens and puppies with contracts which promise to
take back the cat or dog if the new owner cannot continue to care for the
animal; that responsible breeders do not raise and keep their animals in
inhumane conditions and seldom sell animals to pet stores or ship animals
directly via Internet sales; that unlike responsible breeders, commercial kitten
and puppy mills do not perform adequate genetic screening, or provide proper
housing and veterinary care; that kitten and puppy mills breed large volumes of
kittens and puppies and engage in disreputable practices that are harmful to
the health of the animals they breed and their offspring; that some puppy mills
maintain misleading websites, make false promises, and redirect the public away
from responsible breeders; and that while many kitten and puppy mills in the
United States are not licensed as required by the United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), even those commercial breeder puppy mills that are licensed
by the USDA do not provide humane care because the license only requires
minimal standards for animal care and breeding practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the best interest of the citizens of the State to
prohibit the sale of cats, dogs, and rabbits by pet shops; that establishing a
prohibition would close an avenue to the sale of kitten and puppy mill cats and
dogs to consumers; and that it is also in the best interest of the citizens of
the State to encourage pet shops to facilitate and achieve more successful
adoptions by collaborating with animal rescue organizations, shelters, and
pounds and showcasing cats and dogs available for adoption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) As used in

or under contract with, a state, county, or municipality or is a nonprofit
organization established for the purpose of sheltering animals and is exempt
from federal taxation pursuant to section 501(c)(3) of the Federal Internal
Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Unfit for purchase means having
any disease, deformity, injury, physical condition, illness, or defect which is
congenital or hereditary and severely affects the health of the animal, or
which was manifest, capable of diagnosis or likely contracted on or before the
sale and delivery of the animal to the consumer.</p>
