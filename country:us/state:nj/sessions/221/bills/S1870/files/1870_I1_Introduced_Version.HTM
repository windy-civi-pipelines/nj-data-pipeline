S1870 SENATE, No. 1870 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  PARKER SPACE District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Zero-Based Budget Act; requires State Treasurer to develop and integrate certain zero-based budgeting practices and procedures in preparation and submission of Governors annual budget message. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act requiring the State Treasurer to develop and integrate certain zero-based budgeting practices and procedures in the preparation and submission of the Governors annual budget message, supplementing chapter 18A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes and amending P.L.1944, c.112. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) This act shall be known and may be cited as the Zero-Based Budget Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds that there is public need to reform the State budget process.  Economic uncertainty combined with declines in the amount of resources available to deliver critical goods and services has compelled the State to reassess what is essential and to reevaluate the way in which public tax dollars are proposed and allocated for State spending. Under the current budget process a reassessment and reevaluation of this size and scope is impractical if not impossible.  Requests for appropriations and permissions to spend are evaluated based on spending requests above and beyond amounts allocated during the previous fiscal year. The base of past spending is not fully vetted, and the efficiency and effectiveness of current programs and activities is not scrutinized with the detail adequate to prioritize the needs of one department or agency over the needs of another. The development and integration of zero-based budgeting within the existing budgetary framework would provide the Executive, the Legislature, and ultimately the people of the State of New Jersey with the capacity to evaluate, scrutinize, and prioritize annual State appropriations.  Moreover, it would allow the State to construct an annual budget from the ground up, justifying the need for and use of each tax dollar allocated for appropriation.  The Legislature, declares, therefore, that it is in the public interest to require the State Treasurer to design and develop a State budget process that utilizes the practices of zero-based budgeting, and to ensure that these procedures are integrated in the preparation and submission of the Governors annual budget message. 3.    (New section)  For purposes of this act, the following terms shall have the following meanings: Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting or director means the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury. Spending agency means those entities deemed a spending agency as that term is used in subsection a. of section 5 of article 3 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-14). State agency means any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission, or other instrumentality within or created by such principal department; the Legislature of the State and any office, board, bureau, or commission within or created by the Legislative Branch of State Government; the Judiciary of the State and any office, board, bureau, or commission within or created by the Judicial Branch of State Government; and any independent State authority, commission, instrumentality, or agency. Zero-based budget means an approach to developing and evaluating requests for appropriations or permissions to spend based on the cost-effective achievement of the tasks, goals, and objectives of a particular spending agency without regard to prior appropriations or spending permissions, adjusted for inflation or otherwise. Zero-based budget process means a process of budgeting in which a spending agencys request for appropriation or permission to spend is evaluated and justified, in whole or in part, based upon the cost-effective achievement of the tasks, goals, and objectives of a particular spending agency without regard to prior appropriations or spending permissions, adjusted for inflation or otherwise. 4.    (New section)  a.  The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall, on or before July 1, 2011, design and develop, or cause to be designed and developed, a State budget process for State fiscal years commencing on and after July 1, 2012, which requires each spending agency required to file a request for appropriation or permission to spend, in accordance with section 5 of article 3 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-14), to justify their request, in whole or in part, utilizing the practices and procedures of a zero-based budget. b.    At a minimum, the zero-based budget process developed in accordance with subsection a. of this section shall require spending agencies to justify their request, in whole or in part, by submitting: (1)  a statement outlining the goals and objectives intended to be accomplished as a result of the spending agencys request;

(6)  a projected estimate of spending required to maintain each activity, program, or service at the minimum level of service required by statutory or regulatory authority, together with an evaluation of the quality and quantity of services required at that level; (7) a statement identifying each group, stakeholder, or community affected or intended to be affected by each activity, program, or service, and a quantitative estimate of any potential consequences that may result if the spending agencys activities, programs, and services are eliminated; (8)  a statement detailing any other State, federal, or local units of government which administer a similar activity, program, or service and an outline describing the interaction, if any, among such departments and agencies;

STATEMENT The Zero-Based Budget Act requires the State Treasurer to develop and integrate certain zero-based budgeting practices and procedures in the preparation and submission of the Governors annual budget message. Under the provisions of the bill, the State Treasurer, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, is required to design and develop a zero-based budget process on or before July 1, 2011 for State fiscal years commencing on and after July 1, 2012.  While the bill grants the Treasurer considerable latitude in creating a budget process tailored to meet the individual needs of various departments and divisions, bureaus and agencies within each branch of State government, the budget process developed in accordance with this bill requires State spending agencies to justify their request for appropriation or permission to spend, in whole or in part, utilizing the practices and procedures of a zero-based budget. As defined by the bill, a zero based-budget process is a process of budgeting in which a spending agencys request for appropriation or permission to spend is evaluated and justified, in whole or in part, based upon the cost-effective achievement of the tasks, goals, and objectives of a particular spending agency without regard to prior appropriations or spending permissions, adjusted for inflation or otherwise. To facilitate the evaluation and justification of each spending request, the bill stipulates that, at a minimum, State spending agencies must submit to the State Treasurer and the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) a statement outlining the goals and objectives intended to be accomplished as a result of the spending agencys request; (2) a statement delineating each of the various activities, programs, and services to be performed as a result of the request; (3) a compilation of the statutory and regulatory provisions which comprise the spending agencys legal authority, if any, to perform each activity, program, or service; (4) a description of the methodology and approach used to carry out each activity, program, or service; (5) an itemized estimate of spending required to maintain each activity, program, or service at its current level of performance, together with an evaluation of the quality and quantity of services provided; (6) a projected estimate of spending required to maintain each activity, program, or service at the minimum level of service required by statutory or regulatory authority, together with an evaluation of the quality and quantity of services required at that level; (7) a statement identifying each group, stakeholder, or community affected or intended to be affected by each activity, program, or service, and a quantitative estimate of any potential consequences that may result if the spending agencys activities, programs, and services are eliminated; (8) a statement detailing any other State, federal, or local units of government which administer a similar activity, program, or service and an outline describing the interaction, if any, among such departments and agencies; (9) a statement prioritizing by numerical ranking, the activities, programs, or services carried-out by a spending agency with respect to each activitys, programs, or services capacity to fulfill the spending agencys stated goals and objectives during the current and ensuing fiscal years; and (10) any additional data or information deemed necessary or appropriate by the State Treasurer or the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to justify a spending agencys request for appropriation or permission to spend. Under the bill, any zero-based budget data and information submitted as part of a spending agencys request for appropriations or permissions to spend is required to be incorporated into the final request transmitted to the Governor and submitted to the Legislature as part of the Governors annual budget message.  As part of the budget message, the zero-based budget data and information would become part of the public document and would be available to assist the Legislature and ultimately the residents of the State of New Jersey in reviewing and scrutinizing the Governors spending plan for the ensuing fiscal year.

STATEMENT The Zero-Based Budget Act requires the State Treasurer to develop and integrate certain zero-based budgeting practices and procedures in the preparation and submission of the Governors annual budget message. Under the provisions of the bill, the State Treasurer, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, is required to design and develop a zero-based budget process on or before July 1, 2011 for State fiscal years commencing on and after July 1, 2012.  While the bill grants the Treasurer considerable latitude in creating a budget process tailored to meet the individual needs of various departments and divisions, bureaus and agencies within each branch of State government, the budget process developed in accordance with this bill requires State spending agencies to justify their request for appropriation or permission to spend, in whole or in part, utilizing the practices and procedures of a zero-based budget. As defined by the bill, a zero based-budget process is a process of budgeting in which a spending agencys request for appropriation or permission to spend is evaluated and justified, in whole or in part, based upon the cost-effective achievement of the tasks, goals, and objectives of a particular spending agency without regard to prior appropriations or spending permissions, adjusted for inflation or otherwise. To facilitate the evaluation and justification of each spending request, the bill stipulates that, at a minimum, State spending agencies must submit to the State Treasurer and the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting:  (1) a statement outlining the goals and objectives intended to be accomplished as a result of the spending agencys request; (2) a statement delineating each of the various activities, programs, and services to be performed as a result of the request; (3) a compilation of the statutory and regulatory provisions which comprise the spending agencys legal authority, if any, to perform each activity, program, or service; (4) a description of the methodology and approach used to carry out each activity, program, or service; (5) an itemized estimate of spending required to maintain each activity, program, or service at its current level of performance, together with an evaluation of the quality and quantity of services provided; (6) a projected estimate of spending required to maintain each activity, program, or service at the minimum level of service required by statutory or regulatory authority, together with an evaluation of the quality and quantity of services required at that level; (7) a statement identifying each group, stakeholder, or community affected or intended to be affected by each activity, program, or service, and a quantitative estimate of any potential consequences that may result if the spending agencys activities, programs, and services are eliminated; (8) a statement detailing any other State, federal, or local units of government which administer a similar activity, program, or service and an outline describing the interaction, if any, among such departments and agencies; (9) a statement prioritizing by numerical ranking, the activities, programs, or services carried-out by a spending agency with respect to each activitys, programs, or services capacity to fulfill the spending agencys stated goals and objectives during the current and ensuing fiscal years; and (10) any additional data or information deemed necessary or appropriate by the State Treasurer or the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to justify a spending agencys request for appropriation or permission to spend. Under the bill, any zero-based budget data and information submitted as part of a spending agencys request for appropriations or permissions to spend is required to be incorporated into the final request transmitted to the Governor and submitted to the Legislature as part of the Governors annual budget message.  As part of the budget message, the zero-based budget data and information would become part of the public document and would be available to assist the Legislature and ultimately the residents of the State of New Jersey in reviewing and scrutinizing the Governors spending plan for the ensuing fiscal year.
