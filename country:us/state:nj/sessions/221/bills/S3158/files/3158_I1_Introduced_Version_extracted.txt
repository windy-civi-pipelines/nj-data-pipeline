This bill removes the requirement of equal reciprocity, thereby allowing the board to grant licenses without examination to applicants with comparable licenses in other states, provided that the domiciliary state's standards are equal to or comparable to those of this State, even if the domiciliary state does not provide reciprocity to New Jersey licensees.
