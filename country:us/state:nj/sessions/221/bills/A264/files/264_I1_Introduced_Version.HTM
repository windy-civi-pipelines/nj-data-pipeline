and any case in which the manufacturer's shipping weight of any particular passenger automobile is unavailable, or in doubt or dispute, the chief administrator may require that such automobile be weighed on a scale designated by the chief administrator, and such actual weight shall be considered the manufacturer's shipping weight for the purposes of this section; but in all cases the chief administrator's determination of the manufacturer's shipping weight of any such automobile shall be final.  The applicant for registration for passenger automobile shall also pay to the chief administrator the inspection fee fixed in R.S.39:8-2 in addition to the fees described hereinabove.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.149) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately.
