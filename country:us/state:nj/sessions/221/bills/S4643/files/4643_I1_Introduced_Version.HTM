the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 1 of P.L.2002,
c.89 (C.5:5-65.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  The commission shall
provide by regulation for the establishment of a list of persons who
voluntarily seek to be excluded from entry into permitted racetracks and
licensed off-track wagering facilities located in this State and from opening
or maintaining a wagering account with the account wagering system, with the
exchange wagering system, or with the fixed odds wagering system established in
this State.  A person may request placement on the self-exclusion list by
acknowledging in a manner to be established by the commission that the person
is a problem gambler and by agreeing that, during a period of voluntary
exclusion, the person may not collect winnings or recover losses resulting from
wagering at a racetrack or off-track wagering facility or from account
wagering, exchange wagering, or fixed odds wagering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
promulgate regulations to: (1) establish procedures for placements on, and
removals from, the list of self-excluded persons<u>, which shall include a
requirement that those seeking removal from the list of self-excluded persons
review educational and counseling videos concerning the risks associated with
gambling, coping strategies, resources available for continued support, and any
other information or content as may be appropriate, as determined by the
commission, prior to removal</u>; (2) establish procedures for the transmittal
to the permitted racetracks, licensed off-track wagering facilities, the
account wagering system, the exchange wagering licensee, and the fixed odds
wagering licensee of identifying information concerning persons on the
self-exclusion list; and (3) require permitted racetracks, licensed off-track
wagering facilities, the account wagering system, the exchange wagering
licensee, and the fixed odds wagering licensee to establish procedures
designed, at a minimum, to remove persons on the self-exclusion list from
targeted mailings or other forms of advertising or promotions and deny such
persons access to credit, complimentaries, check cashing privileges, club
programs, and other similar benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The commission, a
permitted racetrack, a licensed off-track wagering facility, the account wagering
system, the exchange wagering licensee, the fixed odds wagering licensee, or an
employee thereof shall not be liable to a person on the self-exclusion list or
to another party in a judicial proceeding for harm, monetary or otherwise,
which may arise as a result of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the failure of a
permitted racetrack, licensed off-track wagering facility or the account
wagering system or the exchange wagering licensee or the fixed odds wagering
licensee to withhold wagering privileges from, or restore wagering privileges
to, a person on the self-exclusion list; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   permitting a person on
the self-exclusion list to engage in wagering activity at a permitted racetrack
or licensed off-track wagering facility, or through the account wagering
system, or through the exchange wagering system, or through the fixed odds
wagering system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of section 8 of P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-28), the commission's
self-exclusion list shall be privileged and confidential and shall not be
accessible to the public pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as
amended and supplemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The commission, a
permitted racetrack, a licensed off-track wagering facility, the account
wagering system, the exchange wagering licensee, the fixed odds wagering
licensee, or an employee thereof shall not be liable to a person on the
self-exclusion list or to another party in a judicial proceeding for harm,
monetary or otherwise, which may arise as a result of disclosure or
publication, other than a willfully unlawful disclosure or publication, of the
identity of a self-excluded person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2021, c.193, s.18)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New Section)  a.  Notwithstanding
any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a third party shall be permitted
to petition that another person be added to a list of persons to be excluded
from entry into permitted racetracks and licensed off-track wagering facilities
located in this State and from opening or maintaining a wagering account with
the account wagering system, with the exchange wagering system, or with the
fixed odds wagering system established in this State.  Such petition for
exclusion shall demonstrate, at a minimum, the following: </p>

sole or joint financial responsibility for funds that may be used or deposited
