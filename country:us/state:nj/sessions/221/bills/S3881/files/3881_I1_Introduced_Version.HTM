STATEMENT This bill would amend P.L.2024, c.35 to make changes to the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the Legislature has appropriated funds to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for State fiscal year 2025. In July 2024, P.L.2024, c.35 was enacted into law, which appropriated funds to the DEP for the purpose of financing approximately $2.73 billion in Storm Sandy and other environmental infrastructure projects through the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB) in FY 2025.  This bill would amend the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the DEP is appropriated funds pursuant to P.L.2024, c.35 to include new projects, remove projects, modify the priority of certain projects, and modify the loan amounts for certain projects, as enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of the bill.  As amended by the bill, P.L.2024, c.35 would appropriate to the DEP up to $2.47 billion, and any unexpended balances from previous authorizations, to provide loans to project sponsors for a total of 227 eligible environmental infrastructure projects for FY 2025.  This would include 152 projects on the "Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2025 Clean Water Project Eligibility List" and 67 projects on the "Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2025 Drinking Water Project Eligibility List."

STATEMENT This bill would amend P.L.2024, c.35 to make changes to the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the Legislature has appropriated funds to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for State fiscal year 2025. In July 2024, P.L.2024, c.35 was enacted into law, which appropriated funds to the DEP for the purpose of financing approximately $2.73 billion in Storm Sandy and other environmental infrastructure projects through the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank (NJIB) in FY 2025.  This bill would amend the lists of environmental infrastructure projects for which the DEP is appropriated funds pursuant to P.L.2024, c.35 to include new projects, remove projects, modify the priority of certain projects, and modify the loan amounts for certain projects, as enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of the bill.  As amended by the bill, P.L.2024, c.35 would appropriate to the DEP up to $2.47 billion, and any unexpended balances from previous authorizations, to provide loans to project sponsors for a total of 227 eligible environmental infrastructure projects for FY 2025.  This would include 152 projects on the "Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2025 Clean Water Project Eligibility List" and 67 projects on the "Storm Sandy and State Fiscal Year 2025 Drinking Water Project Eligibility List."
