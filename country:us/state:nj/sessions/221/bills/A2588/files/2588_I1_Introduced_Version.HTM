<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A taxpayer, upon
approval of an application to the authority and the director, shall be allowed
a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-5) in an amount equal to 30 percent of the taxpayers capital
investment in a qualified production facility made during a privilege period
commencing on or after July 1, 2020 but before July 1, 2028.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No tax credit shall be
allowed pursuant to this section for any costs or expenses included in the
calculation of any other tax credit or exemption granted pursuant to a claim
made on a tax return filed with the director, or included in the calculation of
an award of business assistance or incentive, for a period of time that
coincides with the privilege period for which a tax credit authorized pursuant
to this section is allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The order of priority
in which the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other tax
credits allowed by law may be taken shall be as prescribed by the director. The
amount of the tax credit applied under this section against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), for a privilege period,
when taken together with any other payments, credits, deductions, and
adjustments allowed by law shall not reduce the tax liability of the taxpayer
to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). The amount of the tax credit
otherwise allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the
privilege period due to the limitations of this subsection or under other
provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) may be carried forward, if
necessary, to the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for
which the tax credit was allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A taxpayer, with an
application for a tax credit provided for in this section, may apply to the
authority and the director for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of the
taxpayer being allowed any amount of the tax credit against the tax liability
of the taxpayer. The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by
the taxpayer from the authority and the director, may be sold or assigned, in
full or in part, to any other taxpayer that may have a tax liability under the
Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), or
the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., in exchange for
private financial assistance to be provided by the purchaser or assignee to the
taxpayer that has applied for and been granted the tax credit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The tax credit transfer
certificate provided to the taxpayer shall include a statement waiving the
taxpayer's right to claim that amount of the tax credit against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) that the taxpayer has
elected to sell or assign. The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit
transfer certificate allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for
consideration received by the taxpayer of less than 75 percent of the
transferred tax credit amount. Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate
used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability under P.L.1945, c.162
(C.54:10A-1 et seq.) shall be subject to the same limitations and conditions
that apply to the use of a tax credit pursuant to this section. Any amount of a
tax credit transfer certificate obtained by a purchaser or assignee under this
section may be applied against the purchaser's or assignee's tax liability
under N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. and shall be subject to the same limitations and
conditions that apply to the use of a credit pursuant to section 2 of <span
style='color:black'>P.L.  , c.   (C.   )(pending before the Legislature as this
bill)</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The value of tax
credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit
transfer certificates, approved by the director and the authority pursuant to
this section and pursuant to section 2 of <span style='color:black'>P.L.  ,
c.   (C.   )(pending before the Legislature as this bill) </span>shall not
exceed a cumulative total of $100,000,000 in any fiscal year to apply against

tax imposed pursuant to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et
seq. </p>

of tax credits, and tax credit transfer certificates, allowed to taxpayers for
privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under
this section and section 2 of <span style='color:black'>P.L.  , c.   (C.  
)(pending before the Legislature as this bill)</span> exceeds the amount of tax
credits available in that fiscal year, then taxpayers who have first applied
for and have not been allowed a tax credit or tax credit transfer certificate
amount for that reason shall be allowed, in the order in which they have
submitted an application, the amount of tax credit or tax credit transfer
certificate on the first day of the next succeeding fiscal year in which tax
credits and tax credit transfer certificates under this section and section 2
of <span style='color:black'>P.L.  , c.   (C.   )(pending before the
