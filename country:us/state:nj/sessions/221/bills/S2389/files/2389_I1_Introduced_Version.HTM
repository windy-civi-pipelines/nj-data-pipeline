c.163 (C.18A:17-46) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Any school employee <u>or
contracted service provider</u> observing or having direct knowledge from a
participant or victim of an act of violence shall, in accordance with standards
established by the commissioner, file a report describing the incident to the
school principal in a manner prescribed by the commissioner, and <u>a</u> copy

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>] </span></b><u>the report</u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The principal shall notify the
district superintendent of schools of the action taken regarding the incident. 
Two times each school year, between September 1 and January 1 and between
January 1 and June 30, at a public hearing, the superintendent of schools shall
report to the board of education all acts of violence, vandalism, and
harassment, intimidation, or bullying which occurred during the previous
reporting period.  The report shall include the number of reports of
harassment, intimidation, or bullying<u>, disaggregated by race, gender, sexual
orientation, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch under the National
School Lunch Program, special education designation, and English language
learner designation</u>, the status of all investigations, <b><span

the names of the investigators, the type and nature of any discipline imposed
on any student engaged in harassment, intimidation, or bullying, and any other
measures imposed, training conducted, or programs implemented, to reduce
harassment, intimidation, or bullying.  The information shall also be reported
once during each reporting period to the Department of Education.  The report <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>must<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>shall</u>
include data broken down <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>by

education designation, and English language learner designation</u>.  It shall
be a violation to improperly release any confidential information not
authorized by federal or State law for public release.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The report shall be used to
grade each school for the purpose of assessing its effort to implement policies
and programs consistent with the provisions of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-13 et
seq.).  The district shall receive a grade determined by averaging the grades
of all the schools in the district.  The commissioner shall promulgate
guidelines for a program to grade schools for the purposes of this section.</p>

grade for the district and each school of the district shall be posted on the
homepage of the district's website.  A link to the report shall be available on
the district's website.  The information shall be posted on the websites within
10 days of the receipt of a grade by the school and district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a school district's policy
permits a preliminary determination to be made on whether a reported incident
or complaint is a report outside the scope of the definition of harassment,
intimidation, or bullying pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2002, c.83 (C.18A:37-14),
the superintendent shall also provide annually to the board of education
information on the number of times a preliminary determination was made that an
incident or complaint was outside the scope of that definition for the purposes
of the State's monitoring of the school district. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Verification of the reports on
violence, vandalism, and harassment, intimidation, or bullying shall be part of
the State's monitoring of the school district, and the State Board of Education
shall adopt regulations that impose a penalty on a school employee who
knowingly falsifies the report.  A board of education shall provide ongoing
staff training, in cooperation with the Department of Education, in fulfilling
the reporting requirements pursuant to this section.  The majority
representative of the school employees shall have access monthly to the number
and disposition of all reported acts of school violence, vandalism, and
harassment, intimidation, or bullying.</p>

districts shall annually establish, implement, document, and assess bullying
prevention programs or approaches, and other initiatives involving school
staff, students, administrators, volunteers, parents, law enforcement and
community members.  The programs or approaches shall be designed to create
school-wide conditions to prevent and address harassment, intimidation, and
bullying.  A school district may implement bullying prevention programs and
approaches that may be available at no cost from the Department of Education,
the New Jersey State Bar Foundation, or any other entity.  A school district
may, at its own discretion, implement bullying prevention programs and
approaches which impose a cost on the district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A school district may apply to
the Department of Education for a grant to be used for programs, approaches, or
personnel established pursuant to this act, to the extent funds are
appropriated for these purposes or funds are made available through the
&quot;Bullying Prevention Fund&quot; established pursuant to section 25 of
P.L.2010, c.122 (C.18A:37-28).  A school district may make an application for a
grant only after exploring bullying prevention programs and approaches that are
available at no cost, and making an affirmative demonstration of that
exploration in its grant application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A school district shall:

discussing the district's harassment, intimidation<u>,</u> or bullying policy
with students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A school district may satisfy
the training required pursuant to this subsection by utilizing training that

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
definition of harassment, intimidation, or bullying in the Anti-Bullying Bill
of Rights Act to encompass acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying
against all students, not just students in protected classes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As currently defined,
harassment, intimidation, or bullying is required to be reasonably perceived
as being motivated by an actual or perceived characteristic.  The definition
sets forth examples of such characteristics - race, color, religion, ancestry,
national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
mental, physical or sensory disability, or other distinguishing
characteristic.  This bill eliminates the requirement that the conduct is motivated
by these actual or perceived characteristics from the definition.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Commissioner of Education to update the model policy on harassment,
intimidation, or bullying upon any revision of the Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights
Act.  The bill also provides that a school districts policy on prohibiting
harassment, intimidation, or bullying be amended upon any revision of the
Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill removes the
requirement that a school district ensure that its training on harassment,
intimidation, or bullying include instruction on preventing bullying on the
basis of protected categories since these categories are eliminated by the
bill.       </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
that as part of the information provided by the superintendent of schools twice
a year to the board of education regarding acts of violence, vandalism, and
bullying which occurred during the previous reporting period, the
superintendent is to provide the board with information on the number of
reports of harassment, intimidation, or bullying, disaggregated by race,
gender, sexual orientation, eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch under
the National School Lunch Program, special education designation, and English
language learner designation.  Similarly, the bill requires the information that
is to be reported to the Department of Education include this disaggregated
data.</p>
