Eligibility for benefits for a person entering a licensed drug treatment program which does not operate in a State correctional facility or county jail shall commence upon the person's enrollment in the drug treatment program, and shall continue during the person's active participation in, and upon completion of, the drug treatment program, except that during the person's active participation in a drug treatment program and the first 60 days after completion of a drug treatment program, the commissioner shall provide for testing of the person to determine if the person is free of any controlled substance.  If the person is determined to not be free of any controlled substance during the 60-day period, the person's eligibility for benefits pursuant to this paragraph shall be terminated; except that this provision shall not apply to the use of prescription drugs by a person who is actively participating in a drug treatment program, as prescribed by the drug treatment program.  The commissioner shall adopt regulations to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, which shall include the criteria for determining active participation in and completion of a drug treatment program.

(cf: P.L.2016, c.69, s.1) 2.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the eligibility requirements for general assistance benefits under the Work First New Jersey program for individuals convicted of an offense involving the use, possession, or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. Currently, persons convicted of offenses involving the use or possession of a controlled dangerous substance may be eligible for general assistance benefits if they enroll in or complete a licensed drug treatment program, and persons convicted of an offense involving the possession of a controlled dangerous substance are permanently ineligible for benefits.  Certain exceptions to the requirement to complete a drug treatment program apply if no program was available or the applicant was excused from meeting the requirement for good cause. This bill revises these restrictions to provide that anyone who is convicted of an offense involving the use, possession, or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance will be eligible for general assistance benefits under the Work First New Jersey program if the individual completes a drug treatment program or otherwise qualifies for one of the current statutory exceptions.
