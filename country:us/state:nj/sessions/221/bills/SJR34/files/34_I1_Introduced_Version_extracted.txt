SJR34 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 34 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  KRISTIN M. CORRADO District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Establishes April of each year as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution establishing the month of April of each year as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month in New Jersey. Whereas, Military sexual trauma (MST) is a pervasive problem within military communities; and Whereas, The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) defines MST as sexual assault or sexual harassment experienced during military service, including but not limited to being pressured or coerced into sexual activities, experiencing sexual contact without explicit consent such as when an individual is asleep or intoxicated, or receiving unwanted sexual advances; and Whereas, Using national data from its health screening program, the VA found that one in three female veterans and one in 50 male veterans report having experienced MST; and Whereas, In FY 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) received its highest number of sexual assault reports on record with one in five active duty service members having experienced MST; and Whereas, The DOD estimates that the prevalence rate of MST may be higher than reported, citing survey results that found that 60 percent of female service members did not trust the sexual assault reporting process enough to file incident reports after experiencing MST; and Whereas, Active service members and veterans who have experienced MST are at an increased risk of developing adverse health conditions, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders; and Whereas, In 2022, a behavioral science team at the RAND Corporation found that service members with mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD reported higher levels of absenteeism from duty and higher levels of occupational impairment; and Whereas, As a result, MST could negatively impact the overall performance of our nations military, making MST a potential threat to troop stability and national security; and Whereas, As of 2021, New Jersey had an active duty population of 6,461 and, as of 2018, a veteran population of 350,538; and Whereas, An unknown number of these active duty or veteran service members have experienced some form of MST and must now contend with adverse health conditions; and Whereas, Although April currently serves as Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month (SAAPM), there is no official month to acknowledge the struggle against or raise awareness of sexual violence in the military; and Whereas, By establishing April of each year as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month, the State of New Jersey recognizes its active duty and veteran communities who have experienced MST, while affirming its commitment to combat sexual violence; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The month of April of each year is established as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month to promote awareness of sexual violence in the military, recognize the struggles of active service members and veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma, and strengthen New Jerseys commitment to combat sexual violence. 2.  The Governor may annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of the State to observe Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution establishes the month of April of each year as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month to raise awareness of sexual violence in the military, recognize the struggles of active service members and veterans who have experienced military sexual trauma (MST), and strengthen New Jerseys commitment to combat sexual violence. MST refers to sexual assault or sexual harassment experienced during military service. According to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), one in three female veterans and one in 50 male veterans report having experienced MST. A survey conducted by the Department of Defense (DOD) supplemented these findings. In FY 2021, the DOD received its highest number of sexual assault reports on record with one in five active duty service members having experienced MST. In reality, the DOD estimates that the prevalence rate of MST may be higher, citing concerns over underreporting due to a lack of trust in the sexual assault report process. Those who have experienced MST are at an increased risk of developing adverse health conditions, namely post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and other mood disorders. A 2022 study conducted by the RAND Corporation found that mental health conditions such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression were strongly associated with higher levels of absenteeism from duty and greater occupational impairment. As a result, MST compromises both the personal wellbeing of active service members and veterans and the overall quality of military performance. New Jersey has an active duty population of 6,461 and a veteran population of 350,538. Many of these individuals might have experienced military sexual trauma. Currently, April serves as National Sexual Assault Awareness Prevention Month (SAAPM). However, there is no official month to recognize the struggle against or raise awareness of sexual violence in the military. In recognition of New Jerseys active duty and veteran communities who may have experienced MST, this joint resolution establishes April of each year as Military Sexual Trauma Awareness Month.
