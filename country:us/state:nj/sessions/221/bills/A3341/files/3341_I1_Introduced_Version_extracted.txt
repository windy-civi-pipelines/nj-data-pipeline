STATEMENT This bill provides immunity to businesses against claims for damages or injury to individuals arising out of exposure to any public health emergency at premises owned or operated by the employer, or during activity managed by the employer.  The immunity provided in the bill is in addition to any other immunity protections under State or federal law.  The immunity provided in this bill does not apply to willful misconduct, reckless infliction of harm or the intentional infliction of harm. Under the bill employer includes any individual, partnership, association, corporation, business trust, legal representative, or any organized group of persons acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in its relations to employees. It is the sponsors view that establishing immunity for businesses against claims for damage to individuals arising out of exposure to a public health emergency declared by the governor of the State of New Jersey to be a public health emergency, will aid in restoring, strengthening and vitalizing the economy, a key objective, by removing the risk of costly actions for damage arising from exposure to the virus.  With that view in mind, the immunity of the bill extends to include employees and patrons of businesses, except where reckless or intentional conduct is involved.
