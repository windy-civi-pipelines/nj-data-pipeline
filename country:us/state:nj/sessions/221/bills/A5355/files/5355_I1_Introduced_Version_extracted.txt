(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 3.    This act shall take effect immediately but shall remain inoperative until the first day of the 13th month following the date on which the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection c. of section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) have been satisfied.  The chief administrator may take anticipatory actions in advance of that date as may be necessary for the timely implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall expire if the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection c. of section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are not satisfied by the last day of the 12th month following enactment.

The chief administrator is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the plates.  If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue the program. The bill also requires the International First Vice President of the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. and the International Vice President of the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporated to appoint one liaison to represent the two organizations in all communications with the commission regarding the program. The bill prohibits the use of either State or other public funds by the commission to cover the initial cost to implement the program.  The bill requires the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. and the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Incorporatedor an individual or entity designated by the organizationsto contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the plates and for computer programming changes which may be necessary to implement the program.
