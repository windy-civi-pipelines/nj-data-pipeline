(2)  (a)  A ballot drop box shall mean a secured drop box that is not required to be within view of a live person for monitoring.  All ballot drop boxes shall be available for use by a voter 24 hours a day and shall be placed at locations equipped with security cameras that allow for surveillance of the ballot drop box. (b)   Beginning with the 2021 general election, at least one ballot drop box shall be located: at any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; in each municipality with a population larger than 5,000 residents; at the main campus of each State college or university; and the main campus of each independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.  Notwithstanding the locational criteria established by this subparagraph, whenever two or more ballot drop box locations are separated by a distance of less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections in each county shall determine secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes in compliance with the requirements of this section.  The secondary ballot drop box locations shall be located within the municipality where those ballot drop boxes were originally located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the members of the board of elections.  However, in the event of a tie in the votes cast by the members of the board of elections, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box shall be located in a municipality with an average per capita income or a median family income at or below 250% of the federal poverty guideline according to the most recent federal American Community Survey. (c)   The board of elections in each county shall establish no fewer than 10 ballot drop boxes.  To the best of their ability, the board of elections of every county shall place secure ballot drop boxes based on geographic location and population density to best serve the voters of each county in compliance with the guidelines adopted pursuant to subsection c. of this section.  The Secretary of State shall establish guidelines for the placement of the ballot drop boxes, the security of the ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot pickup from the ballot boxes.  Whenever a fire district election is held, the board of elections shall retrieve the mail-in ballots deposited in the ballot drop boxes, at a minimum, once per week.

(e)   Except as otherwise provided herein, no ballot drop box shall be located inside, or within 100 feet of an entrance or exit, of a State, county, or municipal police station. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subparagraph, a ballot drop box that has already been installed and permanently affixed prior to the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.459, at any of the following locations may remain at that location notwithstanding that the ballot drop box is within 100 feet of an entrance or exit of a State, county, or municipal police station if the county commissioners approve the continued presence at that location by a majority vote of the commissioners and with the reasons therefor subject to public disclosure: any county government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; any municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located in municipalities with populations larger than 5,000 residents; the main campus of a county community college; the main campus of a State college or university; and the main campus of an independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.459, s.4) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, whenever a municipal, school, or special election is held, a board of elections may open the following ballot drop boxes: (1) the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located; and (2) the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location. Under current law, fire district elections are not included.  This bill would expand current law and include fire district elections. Under the bill, a board of elections would be permitted to open the following ballot drop boxes during the conduct of a fire district election: (1)   the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located; and (2)   the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location.
