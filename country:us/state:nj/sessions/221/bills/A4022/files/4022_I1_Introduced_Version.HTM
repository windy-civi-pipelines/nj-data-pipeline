<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  The Office of
Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health shall develop a
Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan that shall provide for a
comprehensive, coordinated, emergency medical services system in New Jersey. 
The plan shall include both short-term and long-term goals and objectives, and
may incorporate the use of regional emergency medical services plans tailored
to the specific needs of regions within the State as may be designated by the
office.  Regional plans, if used, shall be jointly developed by each county
board of health in that region, in consultation with local boards of health as
needed.  A regional plan shall be subject to approval by the office; upon
approval, the regional plan shall be deemed to be part of the Statewide plan. 
The office shall review and update the Statewide plan triennially, and shall
make such changes to the plan as may be necessary to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of the States emergency medical services system of care.  The
department shall make the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan available
on its Internet website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In developing and
updating the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan pursuant to subsection
a. of this section, the office shall, at a minimum:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  conduct an inventory of
emergency medical services resources available within the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  conduct an assessment of
the current effectiveness of the emergency medical services system of care in
the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  determine the need for
changes to the current emergency medical services system of care in the State,
including any changes as may be needed to improve access to emergency medical
services in a given region of the State or for a given population within the
State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  develop performance
metrics with regard to the delivery of emergency medical services in the State,
establish a schedule for achieving the performance metrics, develop a method
for monitoring and evaluating whether the performance metrics are being
achieved, and prepare an estimate of costs for achieving the performance
metrics;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  work with professional
medical organizations, hospitals, and other public and private agencies to
develop approaches whereby individuals who presently use the existing emergency
department for routine, nonurgent, primary medical care will be served more
appropriately and economically; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  consult with and review,
with appropriate emergency medical services providers and organizations, the
development of applications to governmental or other appropriate sources for
grants or other funding to support emergency medical services programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The Statewide Emergency
Medical Services Plan developed pursuant to subsection a. of this section
shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  establish a comprehensive
Statewide emergency medical services system, incorporating facilities,
transportation, manpower, communications, and other components as integral
parts of a unified system that will serve to improve the delivery of emergency
medical services and thereby decrease morbidity, hospitalization, disability,
and mortality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  seek to reduce the time
period between the identification of an acutely ill or injured patient and the
provision of definitive treatment for the illness or injury;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  increase access to high
quality emergency medical services for all citizens of New Jersey;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  promote continuing
improvement in system components, including:  ground, water, and air
transportation; communications; hospital emergency departments and other
emergency medical care facilities; health care provider training and health
care service delivery; and consumer health information and education;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  ensure performance
improvement of the emergency medical services system and of the emergency
medical services and care delivered on scene, in transit, in hospital emergency
departments, and within the hospital environment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  conduct, promote, and
encourage programs of education and training designed to upgrade the knowledge
and skills of emergency medical services personnel, including expanding the
availability of paramedic and advanced life support training throughout the
State, with particular emphasis on regions underserved by emergency medical
services personnel having such skills and training;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  maintain a process for
designating appropriate hospitals as trauma centers, certified stroke centers,
and specialty care centers based on an applicable national evaluation system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  maintain a comprehensive
emergency medical services patient care data collection and performance
improvement system, which shall incorporate the information reported to the
department pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2017, c.116 (C.26:2K-67);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)  collect data and
information and prepare reports for the sole purpose of designating and
verifying trauma centers and other specialty care centers, as described in
paragraph (7) of this subsection; provided that data and information collected
and reports prepared pursuant to this paragraph shall not be considered a
government record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), P.L.2001,
c.404 (C.47:1A-5 et al.), or the common law concerning access to government
records;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  establish and maintain a
process for crisis intervention and peer support services for emergency medical
services personnel and public safety personnel, including Statewide
availability and accreditation of critical incident stress management or peer
support teams and personnel. Such accreditation standards shall include a
requirement that a peer support team be headed by a clinical psychologist,
psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or professional counselor who:  (a) is
licensed pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes; and (b) has at least
five years of experience as a mental health consultant working directly with
emergency medical services personnel or public safety personnel;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  coordinate with the
Emergency Medical Services for Children Program to maintain, and update as

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the Office
of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS) in the Department of Health (DOH) to
develop a Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan that provides for a
comprehensive, coordinated, emergency medical services (EMS) system in New
Jersey.  The plan is to include both short-term and long-term goals and
objectives, and may incorporate the use of regional emergency medical services
plans tailored to the specific needs of regions within the State as may be
designated by the OEMS.  If used, regional plans are to be jointly developed by
each county board of health within the designated region, and will be developed
in consultation with local boards of health, as needed.  Regional plans will be
subject to approval by the OEMS; upon receiving such approval, the regional
plan will be deemed to be part of the Statewide plan.  The OEMS will be
required to review and update the Statewide plan triennially, and to make such
changes to the plan as may be necessary to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of the States EMS system of care.  The DOH will be required to make
the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan available on its Internet
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In developing and updating the
Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan, the OEMS will be required, at a
minimum, to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  conduct an inventory of EMS
resources available within the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  conduct an assessment of
the current effectiveness of the EMS system of care in the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  determine the need for
changes to the current EMS system of care, including any changes as may be
needed to improve access to EMS in a given region of the State or for a given
population within the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  develop performance
metrics with regard to the delivery of EMS, establish a schedule for achieving
the performance metrics, develop a method for monitoring and evaluating whether
the performance metrics are being achieved, and prepare a cost estimate for
achieving the performance metrics;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  work with professional
medical organizations, hospitals, and other public and private agencies to
develop approaches whereby individuals who presently use the existing emergency
department for routine, nonurgent, primary medical care will be served more
appropriately and economically; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  consult with and review,
with appropriate EMS agencies and organizations, the development of
applications to governmental or other appropriate sources for grants or other
funding to support EMS programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill additionally requires
the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  establish a comprehensive
Statewide EMS system, incorporating facilities, transportation, manpower,
communications, and other components as integral parts of a unified system that
will serve to improve the delivery of EMS and thereby decrease morbidity,
hospitalization, disability, and mortality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  seek to reduce the time
period between the identification of an acutely ill or injured patient and the
provision of definitive treatment for the illness or injury;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  increase access to high
quality EMS for all citizens of New Jersey;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  promote continuing
improvement in system components, including:  ground, water, and air
transportation; communications; hospital emergency departments and other
emergency medical care facilities; health care provider training and health
care service delivery; and consumer health information and education;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  ensure performance
improvement of the EMS system and of the emergency services and care delivered
on scene, in transit, in hospital emergency departments, and within the
hospital environment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  conduct, promote, and
encourage programs of education and training designed to upgrade the knowledge
and skills of EMS personnel, including expanding the availability of paramedic
and advanced life support training throughout the State, with particular
emphasis on regions underserved by EMS personnel having such skills and
training;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)  maintain a process for
designating appropriate hospitals as trauma centers, certified stroke centers,
and specialty care centers based on an applicable national evaluation system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)  maintain a comprehensive
EMS patient care data collection and performance improvement system, which is
to incorporate certain EMS data currently reported to the DOH;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)  collect data and
information and prepare reports for the sole purpose of designating and
verifying trauma centers and other specialty care centers, which data,
information, and reports will not be considered a government record for the
purposes of open public records access laws;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  establish and maintain a
process for crisis intervention and peer support services for EMS personnel and
public safety personnel, including Statewide availability and accreditation of
critical incident stress management or peer support teams and personnel. The
accreditation standards are to include a requirement that a peer support team
be headed by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or
professional counselor who:  (a) is licensed pursuant to Title 45 of the
Revised Statutes; and (b) has at least five years of experience as a mental
health consultant working directly with EMS personnel or public safety
personnel;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  coordinate with the
Emergency Medical Services for Children Program to maintain, and update as
needed, the Statewide program of EMS for children developed under current law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)  establish and support a
Statewide system of health and medical emergency response teams, including EMS
disaster task forces, coordination teams, disaster medical assistance teams,
and other support teams that will assist local EMS providers at their request
during mass casualty events, disasters, or whenever local resources are
overwhelmed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)  establish and maintain a
program to improve dispatching of EMS personnel and vehicles, including
establishing and supporting EMS dispatch training, accrediting 911 dispatch
centers, and establishing and maintaining public safety answering points; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)  identify and establish
best practices for managing and operating EMS providers, improving and managing
EMS response times, and disseminating such information to the appropriate
persons and entities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In developing the Statewide
Emergency Medical Services Plan, the OEMS will be required to coordinate with
the Emergency Medical Services for Children program and the State trauma
medical director, both of which will be required to revise any plans, programs,
protocols, or other requirements related to EMS as may be necessary to bring
those plans, programs, protocols, or other requirements into conformity with
the Statewide Emergency Medical Services Plan.</p>
