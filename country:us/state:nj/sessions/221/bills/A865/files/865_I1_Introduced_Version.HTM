<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Broker means a person who,
for or in expectation of consideration:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   arranges or offers to
arrange commercial financing for a recipient; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   assists or advises or
offers to assist or advise a recipient in obtaining or attempting to obtain a
commercial financing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the above definition,
broker does not include a provider when referring a recipient to another
provider, or a provider that enters into a written agreement with a financial
institution to arrange for the extension of commercial financing by the
financial institution to a recipient via an online lending platform
administered by the provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Closed-end
financing&quot; means a closed-end extension of credit, secured or unsecured
and including equipment financing, that does not meet the definition of a lease
as that term is defined in N.J.S.12A:2A-103 and the proceeds of which the
recipient does not intend to use primarily for personal, family, or household
purposes. &quot;Closed-end financing&quot; includes financing with an
established principal amount and duration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Commercial
financing&quot; means open-end financing, closed-end financing, sales-based
financing, factoring transaction, or any other form of financing, the proceeds
of which the recipient does not intend to us primarily for personal, family, or
household purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Factoring
transaction&quot; means an accounts receivable purchase transaction that
includes an agreement to purchase, transfer, or sell a legally enforceable
claim for payment held by a recipient for goods that the recipient has supplied
or services that the recipient has rendered that have been ordered but for
which payment has not yet been made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Finance charge&quot;
means the cost of financing as a dollar amount. Finance charge includes any
charge payable directly or indirectly by the recipient and imposed directly or
indirectly by the provider as an incident to or a condition of the extension of
financing. It includes all charges that would be included under 12 C.F.R.
s.1026.4 as if the transaction were subject to 12 C.F.R. s.1026.4. Finance
charge also includes any charges as determined by the commissioner. As it
relates to an open-end financing, the finance charge shall assume the maximum
amount of credit available to the recipient, in each case, is drawn and held
for the duration of the term or draw period. For the purposes of a factoring
transaction, the finance charge includes the discount taken on the face value
of the accounts receivable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Financial
institution&quot; means any of the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a bank, trust company,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a federally chartered
savings and loan association, federal savings bank, federal credit union that
is authorized to transact business in this State, or any credit union service
organization, as defined in 12 C.F.R. s.704.11; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a savings and loan association,
savings bank, or credit union that is authorized to transact business in this
State and that is organized under the laws of this or any other state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Open-end financing&quot;
means an agreement for one or more extensions of open-end credit, secured or unsecured,
the proceeds of which the recipient does not intend to use primarily for
personal, family, or household purposes. &quot;Open-end financing&quot;
includes credit extended by a provider under a plan in which: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the provider reasonably
contemplates repeated transactions; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the provider may impose
a finance charge from time to time on an outstanding unpaid balance; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the amount of credit
that may be extended to the recipient during the term of the plan, up to any

estimated term of repayment and the projected periodic payment amounts. The
provider shall clearly disclose the estimated annual percentage rate as an
estimate, and may include additional statements informing the recipient that
the actual annual percentage rate may vary depending on actual time to repay.
The estimated term of repayment and the projected periodic payment amounts
shall be calculated based on the projected sales volume, which is the
projection of the recipient's sales. The projected sales volume may be
calculated using the historical method or the opt-in method. The provider shall
provide notice to the commissioner on which method the provider will use across
all instances of sales-based financing offered in calculating estimated annual
percentage rate pursuant to this section.  In calculating the projected sales
volume:</p>

historical method shall use an average historical volume of sales or revenue by
which the financing's payment amounts are based and by which the estimated
annual percentage rate is calculated. The provider shall fix the historical
time period used to calculate the average historical volume and use that period
for all disclosure purposes for all sales-based financing products offered. The
fixed historical time period shall be either the preceding time period from the
specific offer or the average sales for the same number of months with the
highest sales volume within the past twelve months. The fixed historical time
period shall be not less than one month and not more than twelve months; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a provider using the
opt-in method shall determine the estimated annual percentage rate, the
estimated term, and the projected payments, using a projected sales volume that
the provider elects for each disclosure.  The provider using the opt-in method
shall participate in a review process to be determined by the commissioner. A
provider shall annually issue a report to the commissioner, in a form and
manner to be determined by the commissioner, of estimated annual percentage
rates disclosed to the recipient and actual retrospective annual percentage
rates of completed transactions. The report shall contain information that the
commissioner determines necessary or appropriate to make a determination of
whether the deviation between the estimated annual percentage rate and actual
retrospective annual percentage rates of completed transactions was reasonable.
The commissioner may, upon a finding that the use of projected sales volume by
the provider has resulted in an unacceptable deviation between estimated and
actual annual percentage rate, require the provider to use the historical
method. The commissioner may consider unusual and extraordinary circumstances
impacting the provider's deviation between estimated and actual annual
percentage rate in the determination of such a finding;</p>

of fees, charges, or commissions listed pursuant to subsection a. of this
section; and</p>

annual percentage rate due to the charges listed above and the resulting dollar
cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    If, as a condition of
obtaining the commercial financing, the provider requires the recipient to pay
off the balance of an existing commercial financing from the same provider, the
provider shall disclose:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     the amount of the new
commercial financing that is used to pay off the portion of the existing
commercial financing that consists of prepayment charges required to be paid
and any unpaid interest expense that was not forgiven at the time of renewal.
For financing for which the total repayment amount is calculated as a fixed
amount, the prepayment charge is equal to the original finance charge
multiplied by the amount of the renewal used to pay off existing financing as a
percentage of the total repayment amount, minus any portion of the total
repayment amount forgiven by the provider at the time of prepayment. If the
amount is more than zero, that amount shall be the answer to the following
question: &quot;Does the renewal financing include any amount that is used to
pay unpaid finance charge or fees, also known as double dipping? Yes, {enter
amount}. If the amount is zero, the answer would be No.&quot;; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    if the disbursement

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    A provider shall obtain
the recipient's written or electronic signature on all disclosures required to
be presented to the recipient pursuant to this act before authorizing the
recipient to proceed further with the commercial financing transaction application.
A provider is not required to obtain the recipients signature on any
disclosure for a commercial financing transaction that is not consummated. When
a provider provides multiple disclosures to a recipient during the negotiation
of a commercial financing transaction that is ultimately consummated, the
provider need only obtain the recipients signature on the final disclosure
that corresponds to the consummated transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  For the purposes of
determining whether a financing is a commercial financing, a provider may rely
on any statement of intended purposes by the recipient. The statement may be a
separate statement signed by the recipient; may be contained in the financing
application, financing agreement, or other document signed or consented to by
the recipient; or may be provided orally by the recipient so long as it is
documented in the recipient's application file by the provider. Electronic
signatures and consents are valid for purposes of the foregoing sentence. The
provider shall not be required to ascertain that the proceeds of commercial
financing are used in accordance with the recipient's statement of intended
purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  Nothing in this act shall
prevent a provider from disclosing additional information on a commercial
financing being offered to a recipient but it shall not be a requirement
pursuant to this act. The information required to be disclosed pursuant to
subsections a. through i. of section 6 of this act shall appear in the
disclosure document before any additional information is disclosed by a
provider, and shall be in larger font and visually separated from the
additional disclosure information. If other metrics of financing cost are
disclosed or used in the application process of a commercial financing, the
metrics shall not be presented as a &quot;rate&quot; if they are not the annual
interest rate or the annual percentage rate. The term &quot;interest, when
used to describe a percentage rate, shall only be used to describe an
annualized percentage rate, including, but not limited to, the annual interest
rate. When a provider states a rate of finance charge or a financing amount to
a recipient during an application process for commercial financing, the
provider shall also state the rate as an &quot;annual percentage rate, using
that term or the abbreviation &quot;APR.</p>

the error and makes whatever adjustments are necessary to assure that the
recipient will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires certain
providers of commercial financing to provide disclosures to recipients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill,
&quot;provider&quot; is defined to mean a person who extends a specific offer
of commercial financing to a recipient and includes a person, including a
broker, who solicits and presents specific offers of commercial financing on
behalf of a third party.  The bill provides that &quot;recipient&quot; means a
person, or the authorized representative of a person, who applies for
commercial financing and is made a specific offer of commercial financing by a
provider, but does not include a person acting as a broker.  Pursuant to the
bill, &quot;commercial financing&quot; is defined to mean open-end financing,
closed-end financing, sales-based financing, factoring transaction, or any
other form of financing, the proceeds of which the recipient does not intend to
us primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a provider
to, at the time of extending a specific offer of commercial financing that is a
sales-based, closed-end, or open-end financing, or a factoring transaction,
make certain disclosures to the recipient in a form and manner to be determined
by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance.  The required disclosures vary by
the type of commercial financing or factoring transaction, and include, but are
not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the finance charge;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the estimated annual
percentage rate, using the words annual percentage rate or the abbreviation
&quot;APR&quot;, expressed as a yearly rate, inclusive of any fees and finance
charges, and calculated in accordance with section 1026.22 of Subpart C of
Regulation Z (12 C.F.R. s.1026.22) of the federal Truth in Lending Act (15
U.S.C. s.1601 et seq.) and according to certain tolerances and requirements; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the total repayment
amount;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   a description of all
other potential fees and charges; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   a description of
collateral requirements or security interests, if any.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the commissioner may require by regulation a provider extending a specific
offer of commercial financing that is not open-end financing, closed-end
financing, sales-based financing, or a factoring transaction but otherwise
meets the definition of commercial financing pursuant the bill to make certain
disclosures to the recipient that are delineated in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, in addition to
other disclosures required pursuant to the bill, a broker who charges any fees,
charges, or commissions that would be paid by the recipient of the financing
shall provide, at the time of extending a specific offer for a commercial
financing transaction and in a form and manner prescribed by the commissioner,
a written disclosure, in a document separate from the providers contract with
the recipient, stating the following, if the information is not contained within
the disclosure offered by the provider directly to the recipient:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a list of all fees or
commissions that would be paid to the broker by the recipient in connection
with the commercial financing; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)    the total dollar amount
of fees, charges, or commissions listed pursuant to the bill; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   any increase to the
annual percentage rate due to the charges listed above and the resulting dollar
cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a provider
to obtain the recipient's written or electronic signature on all disclosures
required to be presented to the recipient pursuant to the bill before
authorizing the recipient to proceed further with the commercial financing
transaction application. Under the bill, a provider is not required to obtain
the recipients signature on any disclosure for a commercial financing
transaction that is not consummated. When a provider provides multiple
disclosures to a recipient during the negotiation of a commercial financing
transaction that is ultimately consummated, the provider need only obtain the
recipients signature on the final disclosure that corresponds to the
consummated transaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this the bill
prevents a provider from disclosing additional information on a commercial
financing being offered to a recipient but additional information is not to be
disclosed as part of the disclosure required pursuant to the bill. The
information required to be disclosed pursuant to subsections a. through i. of
section 6 of the bill is to appear in the disclosure document before any additional
information is disclosed by a provider, and is to be in larger font and
visually separated from the additional disclosure information. If other metrics
of financing cost are disclosed or used in the application process of a
commercial financing, the metrics are not to be presented as a &quot;rate&quot;
if they are not the annual interest rate or the annual percentage rate. The
term &quot;interest, when used to describe a percentage rate, is only to be
used to describe an annualized percentage rate, including, but not limited to,
the annual interest rate. When a provider states a rate of finance charge or a
financing amount to a recipient during an application process for commercial
financing, the provider is to state the rate as an &quot;annual percentage
rate, using that term or the abbreviation &quot;APR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
provider is not to be liable for any failure to comply with any requirement
imposed by the bill, if within 60 days after discovering an error, and prior to
the institution of a civil action by a recipient or the receipt of written
notice of the error from the recipient, the provider notifies the recipient of
the error and makes whatever adjustments are necessary to assure that the
recipient will not be required to pay an amount in excess of the charge
actually disclosed, or the dollar equivalent of the annual percentage rate
actually disclosed, whichever is lower. A provider is to reimburse the
recipient in the event an amount was paid by the recipient in excess of the
charge actually owed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A provider or financer is not
to be liable for inadvertently disclosing a finance charge, annual percentage
rate, periodic payment or irregular payment, average monthly cost, maximum
non&#8208;interest finance charge, or prepayment fee or charge that exceeds the
amount that the provider is required to disclose under the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
commissioner to promulgate regulations concerning the calculation or
determination of any metric required to be disclosed to a recipient; and to
develop and prescribe the form and manner in which a provider is to make a
disclosure pursuant to the bill, which form and manner shall allow recipients
to easily compare financing options, in a clear and conspicuous manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A provider or broker that
violates any provision of the bill, as determined by the commissioner, is to be
liable to a civil penalty of not more than $2,000 for each violation, or not
more than $10,000 for each willful violation.  In addition, upon a finding by
the commissioner that a provider or broker has knowingly violated the
provisions of the bill, the commissioner may order additional relief,
including, but not limited to, a permanent or preliminary injunction on behalf
of any recipient affected by the violation.  A recipient or provider that is
subject to a violation of the bill may bring an action against the provider or
broker and recover a civil penalty if the court finds the provider or broker
knowingly violated the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill does not apply to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a financial institution;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a lender regulated under

makes not more than five commercial financing transactions in this State in a
12 month period;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   an individual commercial
financing transaction in an amount over $500,000 dollars; or</p>
