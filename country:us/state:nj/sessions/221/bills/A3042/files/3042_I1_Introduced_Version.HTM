Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 1 of P.L.2018,
c.79 (C.5:8-51.6) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  It shall be lawful for
an organization eligible to conduct raffles in accordance with section 2 of
P.L.1954, c.5 (C.5:8-51) and registered and licensed with the Legalized Games
of Chance Control Commission to conduct, whether in person at any time or
remotely while the Public Health Emergency declared by the Governor in
Executive Order No. 103 of 2020 is in effect or whenever a Public Health
Emergency, pursuant to the &quot;Emergency Health Powers Act,&quot; P.L.2005,
c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), has been declared by the Governor and is in effect,
raffles in a large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue located in a
municipality where the provisions of the &quot;Raffles Licensing Law,&quot;
P.L.1954, c.5 (C.5:8-50 et seq.), are operative, provided that all other requirements
to conduct raffles are met.  To the extent any conflict exists between this
act, P.L.2018, c.79 (C.5:8-51.6), and the &quot;Raffles Licensing Law,&quot;
P.L.1954, c.5 (C.5:8-50 et seq.), then the provisions set forth in this act
shall govern. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section, the conduct of the raffle remotely using the Internet or other
electronic means shall be deemed to be the conduct of the raffle at the large
sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue, and shall be deemed to take place only
thereat, regardless of any participant's physical location within this State,
provided the large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue and the specific
event with which the conduct of the raffle is associated are conspicuously and
specifically identified in conjunction with the raffles and remote ticket
sales, personnel of the organization conducting the raffle, whether or not
through a third-party vendor, are located in the venue at the time of the sale
and drawing of any ticket, and the drawing and the announcement of any winning raffle
tickets occurs prior to the end of the event at the large sporting <u>or
entertainment</u> venue with which the raffle is associated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An organization conducting a
raffle at a large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue is subject to the
following requirements:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  The organization
conducting the raffle, in conjunction with the large sporting <u>or
entertainment</u> venue, shall announce the winner or winners of a raffle on
the date on which the event with which the raffle is associated occurs.  The
organization and the large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue shall post
each winning raffle ticket number on their respective websites, if such
websites have been established, on the same date as the announcement, which
number shall be posted for one year or until each winner claims the prize and
submits any required documentation.  For raffles conducted in person, any prize
from a raffle shall be delivered to a claimant verified to have the winning
ticket within 30 days of the event in which the raffle took place; however, if no
claimant verified to have the winning ticket claims the prize and signs all
reasonably necessary documentation within 30 days of the event at which the
raffle took place, the organization conducting the raffle shall hold the
proceeds for a period of one year from the date of the raffle.  If no claimant
with the winning raffle ticket claims the prize and has signed all reasonably
necessary documentation within one year from the date of the drawing, then the
prize shall be forfeited and shall revert back to the organization for its own
authorized use. For any raffles conducted remotely while the Public Health
Emergency declared by the Governor in Executive Order No. 103 of 2020 is in
effect or whenever a Public Health Emergency, pursuant to the &quot;Emergency
Health Powers Act,&quot; P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), has been declared
by the Governor and is in effect, any prize from a raffle shall be delivered at
the large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue at which the event with which
the raffle was associated occurred to a claimant verified to have the winning
ticket within one year of the event during which the raffle took place.  If no
claimant with the winning raffle ticket claims the prize and has signed all
reasonably necessary documentation within one year from the date of the
drawing, then the prize shall be forfeited and shall revert back to the
organization for its own authorized use. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the foregoing,
any prize which due to its nature must be claimed by a date certain, such as a
ticket to an event scheduled at the large stadium venue, which is not claimed
within 72 hours of the event, then the prize shall be forfeited and shall
revert back to the organization for its own authorized use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Any daily and annual
limits on the value of prizes contained in existing law or regulation shall not
apply to raffles conducted at large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venues in
accordance with this act, P.L.2018, c.79 (C.5:8-51.6).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  On a quarterly basis in
accordance with a schedule established by the commission, an organization
conducting raffles in a large sporting <u>or entertainment</u> venue in
accordance with this act, P.L.2018, c.79 (C.5:8-51.6), shall furnish to the
control commission a duly verified statement showing the amount of the gross
receipts derived from each raffle held, operated, or conducted in the preceding
quarter, which shall include receipts from the sale of shares, tickets, or
rights in any manner connected with participation in the raffle or the right to
participate therein, each item of expense incurred or paid, and each item of
expenditure made or to be made, name and address of each person to whom each
such item has been or is to be paid, with a detailed description of the
merchandise purchased or the services rendered therefor, the net proceeds
derived from each such raffle, and the uses to which such net proceeds have
