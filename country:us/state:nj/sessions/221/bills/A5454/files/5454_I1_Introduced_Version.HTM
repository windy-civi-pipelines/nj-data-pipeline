<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. (1) A taxpayer shall
be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-5), as calculated pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection,
for the qualified construction costs incurred by the taxpayer during the privilege
period for a qualified moderate-income housing project located in a qualified
distressed municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) The amount of the credit
authorized pursuant to this section shall not exceed the lesser of: (a) 25
percent of the total qualified construction costs incurred by the taxpayer
during the privilege period; or (b) $1,000,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)  In order to claim
the tax credit allowed pursuant to this section, a taxpayer shall submit an
application to the director, in a form and manner prescribed by the director,
demonstrating that the qualified moderate-income housing project undertaken by
the taxpayer meets the requirements of this section.  In addition to any other
information or documentation that the director deems appropriate, the
application shall also include a copy of any receipts or other documentation
demonstrating the qualified construction costs incurred by the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The director shall
review each application submitted by a taxpayer in accordance with this section
and make a determination regarding the approval of the application within 90
calendar days of the date the completed application is received.  The director
shall issue a written certification to each taxpayer whose application has been
reviewed and approved by the director in accordance with this section within
five calendar days of the date the directors determination is made.  A copy of
the certification shall be included in the filing of a return that includes a
claim for the credit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   If the director fails to
make a determination regarding an application submitted pursuant to this
subsection within 90 calendar days of the date the application is received, or
if the director fails to issue a written certification within five calendar
days of the date a determination is made, the application shall be deemed to
have been approved and the written certification shall be deemed to have been
issued by the director.  Each taxpayer that submitted an application in
accordance with this subsection but fails to receive a determination from the
director within 90 calendar days of the date the application is submitted, or
fails to receive a written certification from the director within five calendar
days of the date of the directors determination is made, shall include a copy
of the taxpayers application when filing a return that includes a claim for
the credit allowed in accordance with subsection a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The order of priority
of the application of the credit allowed under this section, together with any
other credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the Director of the
Division of Taxation.  The amount of credits applied under this section against
the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a
privilege period, together with any other payments, credits, deductions, and
adjustments allowed by law, shall not exceed 25 percent of the tax liability
otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability for a privilege period to
an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section
5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit otherwise
allowable under this section which cannot be applied for the privilege period
due to the limitations of this subsection or under other provisions of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) may be carried forward, if necessary, to
the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit
is allowed.      </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  A taxpayer allowed
a credit in accordance with subsection a. of this section may make and file an
application with the director for a tax credit transfer certificate in lieu of
the taxpayer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability
of the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon the review and
approval of an application made and filed in accordance with this subsection,
the director shall issue to the taxpayer a tax credit transfer certificate.  The
tax credit transfer certificate issued to a taxpayer by the director shall
include a statement waiving the taxpayer's right to apply that amount of the credit
against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5)
that the taxpayer has elected to sell to another person in exchange for private
financial consideration.  </p>

certificate issued to a taxpayer by the director may be sold, in full or in
part, to another person that may have a liability for tax under section 5 of

(C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5, in exchange for private financial
consideration to be provided to the taxpayer by the person making the purchase. 
The sale of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate issued to a
taxpayer by the director shall not be made for private financial consideration
of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount.</p>

credit transfer certificate that may be used by a purchaser against a tax
liability of the purchaser under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5),
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3),
section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 shall be subject
