STATEMENT This resolution urges Congress and the President of the United States to enact the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which is pending before the House of Representatives as H.R. 38. H.R. 38 authorizes a person possessing a valid identification document containing the persons photograph to carry a concealed handgun, other than a machine gun or destructive device, in any state, so long as the individual is not prohibited from possessing a firearm under federal law or from carrying a concealed firearm in the individuals state of residence.  This legislation also requires the person to first obtain a permit to carry a concealed firearm before traveling with a firearm into other states, and respects states rights by requiring the traveler to comply with restrictions of the state to which the individual is traveling when present in that state.  States may currently decline to recognize concealed carry permits lawfully issued in other states, leaving citizens traveling in those states without the ability to protect themselves and their families. The resolution urges Congress and the President of the United States to move forward with the enactment of H.R. 38 to: 1) safeguard our citizens constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights, and 2) allow our citizens to engage in interstate travel without fear of sacrificing their Second Amendment rights or the ability to protect themselves and their families.
