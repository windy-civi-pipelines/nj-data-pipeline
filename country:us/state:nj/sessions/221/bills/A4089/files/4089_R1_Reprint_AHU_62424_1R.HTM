c.112 (C.30:13 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b>Be It Enacted </b><i>by the
Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  Sections
10 through 17 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the Certified
Medication Aide in Nursing Homes Staffing Support Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Continued workforce
competition and a shortage of qualified health care professionals has made it
difficult for health care facilities licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136
(C.26:2H-1 et seq.) to recruit and retain direct care staff. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Staffing shortage are
especially severe for the States licensed nursing homes, which continue to
struggle to return to workforce levels in existence before the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The workforce challenges
faced by licensed nursing homes forces existing direct care staff to work additional
hours in order to ensure that the facility meets statutorily required staffing
ratios and the critical needs of its residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The States nursing home
staffing shortages, and the burden that these staffing challenges place on
existing staff, can be alleviated in part by permitting certified medication
aides to administer medications to nursing home residents, as is permitted currently
in 38 other states, and in State licensed assisted living residences,
comprehensive personal care homes, dementia care homes, and assisted living
programs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is therefore,
altogether fitting and proper, that certified medication aides be permitted to
administer medications in all nursing homes licensed pursuant to P.L.1971,
c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 2 of P.L.1997,
c.100 (C.26:2H-83) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The Department of
Health shall not issue a nurse aide<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span

care assistant<u>, or a medication aide</u> certification to any applicant,
except on a conditional basis as provided for in subsection d. of section 3 of

P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), that no criminal history record
information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Identification Division, or in the State Bureau of Identification in the
Division of State Police, which would disqualify that person from being certified.

personal care assistant <u>, or medication aide</u> certified by the department
prior to the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20 upon whom a criminal history
record background check has not been conducted pursuant to sections 2 through 6
of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), shall be required to undergo that
criminal history record background check as a condition of that individual's
initial recertification following the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, a follow-up criminal
