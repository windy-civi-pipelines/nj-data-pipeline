HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Quijano and Assemblyman Atkins SYNOPSIS The Certified Medication Aide in Nursing Homes Staffing Support Act; authorizes certified medication aides to administer medications to nursing home residents. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Aging and Human Services Committee on June 24, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning certified medication aides in nursing homes, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.2020, c.112 (C.30:13 et al.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  Sections 10 through 17 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the Certified Medication Aide in Nursing Homes Staffing Support Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Continued workforce competition and a shortage of qualified health care professionals has made it difficult for health care facilities licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) to recruit and retain direct care staff. b.    Staffing shortage are especially severe for the States licensed nursing homes, which continue to struggle to return to workforce levels in existence before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. c.     The workforce challenges faced by licensed nursing homes forces existing direct care staff to work additional hours in order to ensure that the facility meets statutorily required staffing ratios and the critical needs of its residents. d.    The States nursing home staffing shortages, and the burden that these staffing challenges place on existing staff, can be alleviated in part by permitting certified medication aides to administer medications to nursing home residents, as is permitted currently in 38 other states, and in State licensed assisted living residences, comprehensive personal care homes, dementia care homes, and assisted living programs. e.     It is therefore, altogether fitting and proper, that certified medication aides be permitted to administer medications in all nursing homes licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). 3.    Section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The Department of Health shall not issue a nurse aide[or] , personal care assistant, or a medication aide certification to any applicant, except on a conditional basis as provided for in subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-84), unless the Commissioner of Health first determines, consistent with the requirements of sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), that no criminal history record information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, or in the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police, which would disqualify that person from being certified. A nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certified by the department prior to the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20 upon whom a criminal history record background check has not been conducted pursuant to sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), shall be required to undergo that criminal history record background check as a condition of that individual's initial recertification following the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20. In addition, a follow-up criminal history record background check of federal records shall be conducted at least once every two years as a condition of recertification for every certified nurse aide [and] , personal care assistant , and medication aide ; except that the commissioner, in lieu of conducting follow-up criminal history record background checks for purposes of recertification, may provide for an alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, including, but not limited to, a match of a person's Social Security number or other identifying information with records of criminal proceedings in this and other states.  If the commissioner elects to implement this alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, the commissioner shall report to the Governor and the Legislature prior to its implementation on the projected costs and procedures to be followed with respect to its implementation and setting forth the rationale therefor. A person shall be disqualified from certification if that person's criminal history record background check reveals a record of conviction of any of the following crimes and offenses: (1)   In New Jersey, any crime or disorderly persons offense: (a)   involving danger to the person, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:12-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:13-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:14-1 et seq. or N.J.S.2C:15-1 et seq.; or (b)   against the family, children, or incompetents, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:24-1 et seq.; or (c)   involving theft as set forth in chapter 20 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; or (d)   involving any controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog as set forth in chapter 35 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes except paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (2)   In any other state or jurisdiction, of conduct which, if committed in New Jersey, would constitute any of the crimes or disorderly persons offenses described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, no person shall be disqualified from certification on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check performed pursuant to sections 2 through 6 and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87 and C.53:1-20.9a) if the person has affirmatively demonstrated to the Commissioner of Health clear and convincing evidence of the person's rehabilitation.  In determining whether a person has affirmatively demonstrated rehabilitation, the following factors shall be considered: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted person would hold, has held or currently holds, as the case may be; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the offense occurred; (4)   the date of the offense; (5)   the age of the person when the offense was committed; (6)   whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (7)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the offense; and (8)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the person under their supervision. c.     If a person subject to the provisions of sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87) refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a criminal history record background check, the commissioner shall, as applicable: (1)   not issue a nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification and shall notify the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-84) or the applicant's prospective employer if known, of that denial; or (2)   revoke the person's current nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification and notify the person, and the person's employer, if known, of that revocation.

A4089 1R [First Reprint] ASSEMBLY, No. 4089 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 18, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Assemblyman  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblywoman  GARNET R. HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Quijano and Assemblyman Atkins SYNOPSIS The Certified Medication Aide in Nursing Homes Staffing Support Act; authorizes certified medication aides to administer medications to nursing home residents. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Aging and Human Services Committee on June 24, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning certified medication aides in nursing homes, amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing P.L.2020, c.112 (C.30:13 et al.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  Sections 10 through 17 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the Certified Medication Aide in Nursing Homes Staffing Support Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Continued workforce competition and a shortage of qualified health care professionals has made it difficult for health care facilities licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) to recruit and retain direct care staff. b.    Staffing shortage are especially severe for the States licensed nursing homes, which continue to struggle to return to workforce levels in existence before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. c.     The workforce challenges faced by licensed nursing homes forces existing direct care staff to work additional hours in order to ensure that the facility meets statutorily required staffing ratios and the critical needs of its residents. d.    The States nursing home staffing shortages, and the burden that these staffing challenges place on existing staff, can be alleviated in part by permitting certified medication aides to administer medications to nursing home residents, as is permitted currently in 38 other states, and in State licensed assisted living residences, comprehensive personal care homes, dementia care homes, and assisted living programs. e.     It is therefore, altogether fitting and proper, that certified medication aides be permitted to administer medications in all nursing homes licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). 3.    Section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The Department of Health shall not issue a nurse aide[or] , personal care assistant, or a medication aide certification to any applicant, except on a conditional basis as provided for in subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-84), unless the Commissioner of Health first determines, consistent with the requirements of sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), that no criminal history record information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, or in the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police, which would disqualify that person from being certified. A nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certified by the department prior to the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20 upon whom a criminal history record background check has not been conducted pursuant to sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87), shall be required to undergo that criminal history record background check as a condition of that individual's initial recertification following the effective date of P.L.2000, c.20. In addition, a follow-up criminal history record background check of federal records shall be conducted at least once every two years as a condition of recertification for every certified nurse aide [and] , personal care assistant , and medication aide ; except that the commissioner, in lieu of conducting follow-up criminal history record background checks for purposes of recertification, may provide for an alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, including, but not limited to, a match of a person's Social Security number or other identifying information with records of criminal proceedings in this and other states.  If the commissioner elects to implement this alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, the commissioner shall report to the Governor and the Legislature prior to its implementation on the projected costs and procedures to be followed with respect to its implementation and setting forth the rationale therefor. A person shall be disqualified from certification if that person's criminal history record background check reveals a record of conviction of any of the following crimes and offenses: (1)   In New Jersey, any crime or disorderly persons offense: (a)   involving danger to the person, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:12-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:13-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:14-1 et seq. or N.J.S.2C:15-1 et seq.; or (b)   against the family, children, or incompetents, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:24-1 et seq.; or (c)   involving theft as set forth in chapter 20 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; or (d)   involving any controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog as set forth in chapter 35 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes except paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (2)   In any other state or jurisdiction, of conduct which, if committed in New Jersey, would constitute any of the crimes or disorderly persons offenses described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, no person shall be disqualified from certification on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check performed pursuant to sections 2 through 6 and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87 and C.53:1-20.9a) if the person has affirmatively demonstrated to the Commissioner of Health clear and convincing evidence of the person's rehabilitation.  In determining whether a person has affirmatively demonstrated rehabilitation, the following factors shall be considered: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted person would hold, has held or currently holds, as the case may be; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the offense occurred; (4)   the date of the offense; (5)   the age of the person when the offense was committed; (6)   whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (7)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the offense; and (8)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the person under their supervision. c.     If a person subject to the provisions of sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87) refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a criminal history record background check, the commissioner shall, as applicable: (1)   not issue a nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification and shall notify the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-84) or the applicant's prospective employer if known, of that denial; or (2)   revoke the person's current nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification and notify the person, and the person's employer, if known, of that revocation. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.240) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-84) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  An applicant for certification, or a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83), shall submit to the Commissioner of Health that individual's name, address, and fingerprints taken on standard fingerprint cards by a State or municipal law enforcement agency.  The commissioner is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Division of State Police for use in making the determinations required by sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87). b.    Upon receipt of the criminal history record information for a person from the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Division of State Police, the commissioner shall immediately notify, in writing, the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of this section or the applicant's prospective employer if known, or a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83) and that person's employer, as applicable, of the person's qualification or disqualification for certification under sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87).  If the person is disqualified, the conviction or convictions which constitute the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the notice to the person, but shall not be identified in the notice to the person's employer or prospective employer. c.     The person who is the subject of the background check shall have 30 days from the date of the written notice of disqualification to petition the commissioner for a hearing on the accuracy of the person's criminal history record information or to establish the person's rehabilitation under subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83).  The commissioner shall notify the person's employer or prospective employer of the person's petition for a hearing within five days following the receipt of the petition from the person.  Upon the issuance of a final decision upon a petition to the commissioner pursuant to this subsection, the commissioner shall notify the person and the person's employer or prospective employer as to whether the person remains disqualified from certification under sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87). d.    An applicant for certification may be issued conditional certification and may be employed as a nurse aide [or] , a personal care assistant , or a medication aide conditionally for a period not to exceed 60 days, pending completion of a criminal history record background check required under sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87) by the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety based upon an examination of its own files in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), and for an additional period not to exceed 60 days pending completion of a criminal history record background check by federal authorities as arranged for by the Division of State Police pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), if the person submits to the commissioner a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83).  A person who submits a false sworn statement shall be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide [or] , a personal care assistant, or a medication aide, as the case may be, and shall not have an opportunity to establish rehabilitation pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83). A conditionally employed person, or an employed person certified as a nurse aide  [or] , a personal care assistant , or a medication aide, who disputes the accuracy of the criminal history record information and who files a petition requesting a hearing pursuant to subsection c. of this section may remain employed by that person's employer until the commissioner rules on the person's petition but, pending the commissioner's ruling, the employer shall not permit the person to have unsupervised contact with patients, residents, or clients, as the case may be, who are 60 years of age or older. e. (1) A licensed health care facility or other entity that has received an application from or conditionally employs an applicant for nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification, or employs a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant, or medication aide, and: (a)   receives notice from the Commissioner of Health that the applicant or certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant, or medication aide, as applicable, has been determined by the commissioner to be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide pursuant to sections 2 through 6 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83 through 87); or (b)   terminates its employment of a conditionally employed applicant for nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide certification or a certified nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide because the person was disqualified from employment at the health care facility or other entity on the basis of a conviction of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 2 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.26:2H-83) after commencing employment at the health care facility or other entity; shall be immune from liability for disclosing that disqualification or termination in good faith to another licensed health care facility or other entity that is qualified by statute or regulation to employ the person as a nurse aide [or] , personal care assistant , or medication aide.
