POLISTINA District 2 (Atlantic) SYNOPSIS Establishes certain exceptions for emergency personnel operating personal watercraft while providing rescue services. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning personal watercrafts and amending P.L.1993, c.299. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1993, c.299 (C.12:7-63) is amended to read as follows: 2.    A person shall not operate a personal watercraft: a.     On the waters of this State between sunset and sunrise, or during any time of restricted visibility as determined by an agent or officer of the Marine [Law Enforcement] Service Bureau, Division of State Police; b.    Within the confines of the Point Pleasant Canal in the County of Ocean, or the Cape May Canal in the County of Cape May; c.     Above minimum headway speed within 100 feet of: (1)   Buoys or signs that mark the boundaries of a swimming area; (2)   The shoreline; (3)   Any person in the water; or (4)   Residential dwelling units; or d.    In such a manner as to make the vessel completely leave the water or otherwise become airborne within 100 feet of another vessel. e.     The provisions of this section shall not apply to any of the following persons while in actual performance of their official duties: a law enforcement officer, a member of a paid, part paid, or volunteer fire department, a member of a State, county, or municipal beach patrol, or a person trained and certified or licensed to provide emergency medical care, whether on a paid or volunteer basis. (cf: P.L.2009, c.108, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill affords emergency personnel certain exceptions under the law while operating a personal water craft, often referred to as a jet ski, in performance of official duties. Under current law, jet ski operators are prohibited from exceeding minimum headway speed within 100 feet of the shoreline, buoys or signs that mark the boundaries of a swimming area, any person in the water, or residential dwelling units.  Jet ski operators are also prohibited from operating the vessel in manner that makes it airborne within 100 feet of another vessel. This bill waives these requirements for any law enforcement officer, a member of a fire department, a member of a State, county or municipal beach patrol, or emergency medical services personnel who are operating a jet ski while in actual performance of their official duties.
