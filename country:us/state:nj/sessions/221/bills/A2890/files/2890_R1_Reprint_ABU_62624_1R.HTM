<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1941,
c.100 (C.34:13A-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    When used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The term
&quot;board&quot; shall mean New Jersey State Board of Mediation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The term
&quot;commission&quot; shall mean New Jersey Public Employment Relations
Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The term
&quot;employer&quot; includes an employer and any person acting, directly or
indirectly, on behalf of or in the interest of an employer with the employer's
knowledge or ratification, but a labor organization, or any officer or agent
thereof, shall be considered an employer only with respect to individuals
employed by such organization.  This term shall include &quot;public
employers&quot; and shall mean the State of New Jersey, or the several counties
and municipalities thereof, or any other political subdivision of the State, or
a school district, or any special district, or any authority, commission, or
board, or any branch or agency of the public service.  The term shall also
include the Delaware River Port Authority, established pursuant to R.S.32:3-1
et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The term
&quot;employee&quot; shall include any employee, and shall not be limited to
the employees of a particular employer unless this act explicitly states
otherwise, and shall include any individual whose work has ceased as a
consequence of or in connection with any current labor dispute or because of
any unfair labor practice and who has not obtained any other regular and
substantially equivalent employment.  This term, however, shall not include any
individual taking the place of any employee whose work has ceased as aforesaid,
nor shall it include any individual employed by his parent or spouse, or in the
domestic service of any person in the home of the employer, or employed by any
company owning or operating a railroad or railway express subject to the
provisions of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. s.151 et seq.).  This term shall
include any public employee, i.e., any person holding a position, by appointment
or contract, or employment in the service of a public employer, including the
Delaware River Port Authority, except elected officials, members of boards and
commissions, managerial executives and confidential employees.  <u>The
exclusion of members of boards and commissions from the definition of
employee contained within this subsection, shall not apply to members of the
Board of Review established pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1948, c.446 (C.34:1A-19)
and subsection (d) of R.S. 43:21-10.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   The term
&quot;representative&quot; is not limited to individuals but shall include
labor organizations, and individual representatives need not themselves be
employed by, and the labor organization serving as a representative need not be
limited in membership to the employees of, the employer whose employees are
represented.  This term shall include any organization, agency or person
authorized or designated by a public employer, public employee, group of public
employees, or public employee association to act on its behalf and represent it
or them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   &quot;Managerial
executives&quot; of a public employer, in the case of the State of New Jersey,
means persons who formulate management policies and practices, but shall not
mean persons who are charged with the responsibility of directing the
effectuation of such management policies and practices, except that, in the
case of the Executive Branch of the State of New Jersey, &quot;managerial
executive&quot; shall include only personnel at or above the level of assistant
commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of any public
employer other than the State of New Jersey, &quot;managerial executives&quot;
of a public employer means persons who formulate management policies and
practices, and persons who are charged with the responsibility of directing the
effectuation of such management policies and practices, except that in any
school district this term shall include only the superintendent or other chief
administrator, and the assistant superintendent of the district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   &quot;Confidential
employees&quot; of a public employer means employees whose functional
responsibilities or knowledge in connection with the issues involved in the
collective negotiations process would make their membership in any appropriate
negotiating unit incompatible with their official duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Confidential
employees&quot; of the State of New Jersey means employees who have direct
involvement in representing the State in the collective negotiations process
making their membership in any appropriate negotiating unit incompatible with
their official duties.</p>
