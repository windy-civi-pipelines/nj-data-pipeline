<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Notwithstanding any
other provision of law to the contrary, every hospital service corporation
contract that provides hospital and medical expense benefits and is delivered,
issued, executed, or renewed in this State pursuant to P.L.1938, c.366
(C.17:48-1 et seq.), or approved for issuance or renewal in this State by the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on or after the effective date of this
act, shall provide coverage pursuant to the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     <u>(1)</u>  The
hospital service corporation shall provide coverage for expenses incurred in
screening and diagnosing autism or another developmental disability<u>, including,
but not limited to, central auditory processing disorder, childhood apraxia of
speech, sensory processing disorder, and social communication disorder</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)   Practitioners shall
use the DSM IV-TR when rendering an autism diagnosis under this section, but an
obligation to provide coverage for expenses pursuant to this section shall be
required whether an autism diagnosis is rendered under the DSM IV-TR, the
IDC-9-CM, or any other version of the DSM or ICD-CM published on or after January
1, 2000.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    When the covered
person's primary diagnosis is autism<u>, central auditory processing disorder,
childhood apraxia of speech, sensory processing disorder, social communication
disorder,</u> or another developmental disability, the hospital service
corporation shall provide coverage for expenses incurred for medically
necessary occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy, as
prescribed through a treatment plan.  Coverage of these therapies shall not be
denied on the basis that the treatment is not restorative <u>or on the basis of
any other exclusionary or otherwise limiting language</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     When the covered person
is under 21 years of age and the covered person's primary diagnosis is autism <u>or
social communication disorder</u>, the hospital service corporation shall provide
coverage for expenses incurred for medically necessary behavioral interventions
based on the principles of applied behavioral analysis and related structured
behavioral programs, as prescribed through a treatment plan <u>and as
administered directly by, or under the supervision of, a practitioner</u>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Except as provided in
paragraph (3) of this subsection, the benefits provided pursuant to this
subsection shall be provided to the same extent as for any other medical
condition under the contract, but shall not be subject to limits on the number
of visits that a covered person may make to a provider of behavioral
interventions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The benefits provided
pursuant to this subsection shall not be denied on the basis that the treatment

amount for a covered person in any calendar year through 2011 shall be $36,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Commencing on January 1,
2012, the maximum benefit amount shall be subject to an adjustment, to be
promulgated by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and published in the
New Jersey Register no later than February 1 of each calendar year, which shall
be equal to the change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers for
the nation, as prepared by the United States Department of Labor, for the
calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the adjustment to the
maximum benefit amount is promulgated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The adjusted maximum
benefit amount shall apply to a contract that is delivered, issued, executed,
or renewed, or approved for issuance or renewal, in the 12-month period
following the date on which the adjustment is promulgated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of this paragraph to the contrary, a hospital service corporation
shall not be precluded from providing a benefit amount for a covered person in
any calendar year that exceeds the benefit amounts set forth in subparagraphs

DSM or ICD-CM published on or after January 1, 2000.</u><em>    </em></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><em>     <u>Childhood apraxia of
speech</u></em><u> means a neurological childhood speech sound disorder in
which the precision and consistency of movements underlying speech are impaired
in the absence of neuromuscular deficits.  The disorder may occur as a result
of known neurological impairment, in association with complex neurobehavioral
disorders of known or unknown origin, or as an idiopathic neurogenic speech
sound disorder.  The core impairment in planning or programming spatiotemporal
parameters of movement sequences results in errors in speech sound production
and prosody.  The disorder includes conditions classified under phonological
disorder in the DSM IV-TR or ICD-9-CM, conditions classified under speech sound
disorder in any version of the DSM or ICD-CM published on or after January
 1, 2000, and any equivalent conditions classified under any version of the DSM
or ICD-CM published on or after January 1, 2000.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Practitioner means a
physician, psychologist, or other health care professional licensed pursuant to
Title 45 of the Revised Statutes who is qualified by training to make a
diagnosis of autism, central auditory processing disorder, childhood apraxia of
speech, sensory processing disorder, social communication disorder, or another
developmental disability.  For the purposes of this act, practitioner shall
also include an individual credentialed by the Behavior Analyst Certification
Board as a Board Certified Behavior Analyst or as a Board Certified Behavior
Analyst-Doctoral.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Sensory processing
disorder means a condition characterized by one or more of the following
symptoms that impair daily routines or roles: sensory modulation disorder,
defined as difficulty regulating responses to sensory input or as behavior that
is not graded relative to the degree, nature, or intensity of the sensory
information and including, but not limited to, sensory over-responsivity,
sensory under-responsivity, and sensory craving; sensory discrimination
disorder, defined as difficulty interpreting qualities of sensory stimuli or
perceiving similarities and differences among stimuli and including, but not
limited to, sensory discrimination disorder subtypes affecting the visual,
auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, vestibular, proprioceptive, and
interoceptive sensory systems; and sensory-based motor disorder, defined as a
sensory-based impairment of postural or motor planning abilities including, but
not limited to, the sensory-based motor disorder subtypes of postural disorder,
which involves difficulties with core motor functions and balance, and motor
planning disorder, which involves difficulties with the ideation, sequencing,
and execution of novel motor actions.  Sensory processing disorder includes any
equivalent conditions classified under any version of the DSM or ICD-CM
published on or after January 1, 2000.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Social communication
disorder means a condition characterized by the following symptoms that are
present from early childhood and that result in functional limitations in
effective communication, social participation, academic achievement, or
occupational performance: persistent difficulties in pragmatics or the social
uses of verbal and nonverbal communication in naturalistic contexts, which
affect the development of social reciprocity and social relationships and which
cannot be explained by low abilities in the domains of word structure and
grammar or general cognitive ability; persistent difficulties in the
acquisition and use of spoken language, written language, or other modalities
of language for narrative, expository, and conversational discourse; and the
absence of restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or  activities,
 thereby  ruling out an autism diagnosis. The </u><br clear=all

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill defines autism and
adds certain requirements concerning health benefits coverage for autism and other
developmental disabilities. The bill also adds requirements concerning health
benefits coverage for central auditory processing disorder, childhood apraxia
of speech, sensory processing disorder, and social communication disorder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends P.L.2009,
c.115, which requires certain health benefits coverage for diagnosing and
treating autism and other developmental disabilities, by defining autism to
include any one of several related conditions commonly classified under
pervasive developmental disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM IV-TR) or the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM).  These related conditions include: autism spectrum disorder; autistic
disorder; Aspergers disorder; childhood disintegrative disorder; pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified or unspecified pervasive
developmental disorder; fragile X syndrome and Retts disorder, to the extent
that either condition is comorbid with pervasive developmental disorder; and
any other equivalent conditions.  The bill also requires that health care
practitioners, as defined pursuant to the bill, use the DSM IV-TR to render an
autism diagnosis and requires that health insurers maintain an individuals
eligibility for health benefits coverage even if an autism diagnosis is
rendered under an updated version of the DSM IV-TR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill newly requires health
insurers to provide coverage for occupational therapy, physical therapy, and
speech therapy related to treating central auditory processing disorder,
childhood apraxia of speech, sensory processing disorder, and social
communication disorder.  The bill also newly requires health insurers to
provide coverage for applied behavioral analysis interventions related to
treating social communication disorder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The insurers and programs to
which the provisions of this bill apply include:  health, hospital and medical
service corporations; commercial individual and group health insurers; health
benefits plans issued pursuant to the New Jersey Individual Health Coverage and
Small Employer Health Benefits Programs; health maintenance organizations; the
State Health Benefits Program; and the School Employees Health Benefits
Program.  The bill requires attorneys fees to be awarded under successful
claims demonstrating that an insurer or program has failed to comply with the
provisions of the bill.</p>
