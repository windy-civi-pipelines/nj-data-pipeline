There are many large warehouses across this State that have been vacant for years, oftentimes located in close proximity to one another, creating a cycle of ruinous competition. This bills intent is to ensure that new warehouses are guaranteed to be occupied with businesses, demonstrating the communitys need for the warehouse.
