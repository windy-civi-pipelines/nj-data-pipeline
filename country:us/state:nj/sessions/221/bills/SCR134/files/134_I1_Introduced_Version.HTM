SCR134 SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 134 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 5, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  PATRICK J. DIEGNAN, JR. District 18 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Respectfully urges Congress to appropriate emergency funds for and increase staffing at facilities supporting Newark Liberty International Airport. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution respectfully urging the United States Congress to appropriate emergency funds to immediately modernize air traffic control infrastructure and increase staffing at facilities supporting Newark Liberty International Airport. Whereas, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is a critical transportation hub for New Jersey, serving nearly 50 million passengers annually and supporting the States economy through air travel, cargo transport, and tourism; and Whereas, In July 2024, control of EWRs airspace was transferred from New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) to Philadelphia TRACON, a move intended to address understaffing at New York TRACON; and Whereas, The shift to Philadelphia TRACON did not increase the number of air traffic controllers available to manage EWRs airspace; and Whereas, EWR has experienced multiple serious air traffic control system disruptions, including radar and communications outages which have resulted in flight delays, flight cancellations, ground stops, and air traffic controllers taking medical leave; and Whereas, The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has struggled with outdated infrastructure for decades and has acknowledged that old systems, such as aging copper telecommunications lines and remote radar feeds, are contributing to the ongoing issues at EWR; and Whereas, The FAA is below targeted staffing levels nationwide and the Philadelphia TRACON remains affected by the nationwide air traffic controller shortage, with only 22 fully certified controllers and several others still in training, putting air traffic controllers in untenable situations and leading to precautionary flight caps at EWR, exacerbating flight delays and cancellations; and Whereas, On May 8, 2025, the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation announced a plan to build a brand new air traffic control system; however, this long-term plan will take years to complete and action to modernize air traffic control infrastructure and increase staffing at EWR is urgently needed now; and Whereas, The safe, efficient, and modern functioning of the national airspace system is a federal responsibility, and ensuring system reliability and resilience at high-volume airports like EWR is essential to avoiding catastrophes and protecting public safety, regional economic continuity, and national mobility, and is in the best interests of the State; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.    The Legislature of New Jersey respectfully urges the United States Congress to appropriate emergency funds to immediately modernize air traffic control infrastructure serving the region and increase staffing at facilities supporting Newark Liberty International Airport. 2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and every member of Congress from the State of New Jersey. STATEMENT Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is a critical transportation hub for New Jersey, serving nearly 50 million passengers annually and supporting the States economy through air travel, cargo transport, and tourism.  In July 2024, control of EWRs airspace was transferred from New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) to Philadelphia TRACON, a move intended to address understaffing at New York TRACON.  The shift to Philadelphia TRACON did not increase the number of air traffic controllers available to manage EWRs airspace. EWR has experienced multiple serious air traffic control system disruptions, including radar and communications outages which have resulted in flight delays, flight cancellations, ground stops, and air traffic controllers taking medical leave. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has struggled with outdated infrastructure for decades and has acknowledged that old systems, such as aging copper telecommunications lines and remote radar feeds, are contributing to the ongoing issues at EWR. The FAA is below targeted staffing levels nationwide and the Philadelphia TRACON remains affected by the nationwide air traffic controller shortage, with only 22 fully certified controllers and several others still in training, putting air traffic controllers in untenable situations and leading to precautionary flight caps at EWR, exacerbating flight delays and cancellations. On May 8, 2025, the Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation announced a plan to build a brand new air traffic control system, but this long-term plan will take years to complete and action to modernize air traffic control infrastructure and increase staffing at EWR is urgently needed now. The safe, efficient, and modern functioning of the national airspace system is a federal responsibility, and ensuring system reliability and resilience at high-volume airports like EWR is essential to avoiding catastrophes and protecting public safety, regional economic continuity, and national mobility, and is in the best interests of the State.
