STATEMENT This bill would establish an Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in order to protect the citizens of New Jersey from the adverse effects of abandoned mines in the State, including mine subsidence and water quality degradation. The bill would first direct the DEP to develop a Statewide plan for the reclamation of abandoned mines. The bill would require certain minimum contents in the plan, including a ranked order of reclamation projects to reclaim, backfill, stabilize, or otherwise render safe all dangerous mineshafts and mine voids present in the State. After the DEP completes the Statewide plan, the bill would direct the DEP to begin implementing the plan, either by carrying out mine reclamation projects itself, or by granting moneys to municipalities or private landowners to carry out the projects. Finally, the bill would establish the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Program Fund in the DEP.  The fund would serve as the repository for federal or State funds, which are to be used for mine reclamation projects.
