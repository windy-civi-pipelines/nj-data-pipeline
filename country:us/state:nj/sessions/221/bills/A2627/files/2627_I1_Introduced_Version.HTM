<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    No lessee or tenant or
the assigns, under-tenants or legal representatives of such lessee or tenant
may be removed by the Superior Court from any house, building, mobile home or
land in a mobile home park or tenement leased for residential purposes, other
than (1) owner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units or a
hotel, motel or other guest house or part thereof rented to a transient guest
or seasonal tenant; (2) a dwelling unit which is held in trust on behalf of a
member of the immediate family of the person or persons establishing the trust,
provided that the member of the immediate family on whose behalf the trust is
established permanently occupies the unit; and (3) a dwelling unit which is
permanently occupied by a member of the immediate family of the owner of that
unit, provided, however, that exception (2) or (3) shall apply only in cases in
which the member of the immediate family has a developmental disability, except
upon establishment of one of the following grounds as good cause:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The person fails to pay
rent due and owing under the lease whether the same be oral or written;
provided that, for the purposes of this section, any portion of rent unpaid by
a tenant to a landlord but utilized by the tenant to continue utility service
to the rental premises after receiving notice from an electric, gas, water or
sewer public utility that such service was in danger of discontinuance based on
nonpayment by the landlord, shall not be deemed to be unpaid rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The person has continued
to be, after written notice to cease, so disorderly as to destroy the peace and
quiet of the occupants or other tenants living in said house or neighborhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The person has
willfully or by reason of gross negligence caused or allowed destruction,
damage or injury to the premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The person has
continued, after written notice to cease, to substantially violate or breach
any of the landlord's rules and regulations governing said premises, provided
such rules and regulations are reasonable and have been accepted in writing by
the tenant or made a part of the lease at the beginning of the lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1)  The person has
continued, after written notice to cease, to substantially violate or breach
any of the covenants or agreements contained in the lease for the premises
where a right of reentry is reserved to the landlord in the lease for a
violation of such covenant or agreement, provided that such covenant or
agreement is reasonable and was contained in the lease at the beginning of the
lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In public housing under
the control of a public housing authority or redevelopment agency, the person
has substantially violated or breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in the lease for the premises pertaining to illegal uses of
controlled dangerous substances, or other illegal activities, whether or not a
right of reentry is reserved to the landlord in the lease for a violation of
such covenant or agreement, provided that such covenant or agreement conforms
to federal guidelines regarding such lease provisions and was contained in the
lease at the beginning of the lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The person has failed
to pay rent after a valid notice to quit and notice of increase of said rent,
provided the increase in rent is not unconscionable and complies with any and
all other laws or municipal ordinances governing rent increases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The landlord or owner
(1) seeks to permanently board up or demolish the premises because he has been
cited by local or State housing inspectors for substantial violations affecting
the health and safety of tenants and it is economically unfeasible for the
owner to eliminate the violations; (2) seeks to comply with local or State
housing inspectors who have cited him for substantial violations affecting the
health and safety of tenants and it is unfeasible to so comply without removing
the tenant; simultaneously with service of notice of eviction pursuant to this
clause, the landlord shall notify the Department of Community Affairs of the
intention to institute proceedings and shall provide the department with such
other information as it may require pursuant to rules and regulations.  The
department shall inform all parties and the court of its view with respect to
the feasibility of compliance without removal of the tenant and may in its
discretion appear and present evidence; (3) seeks to correct an illegal
occupancy because he has been cited by local or State housing inspectors or
zoning officers and it is unfeasible to correct such illegal occupancy without
removing the tenant; or (4) is a governmental agency which seeks to permanently
retire the premises from the rental market pursuant to a redevelopment or land
clearance plan in a blighted area. In those cases where the tenant is being
removed for any reason specified in this subsection, no warrant for possession
shall be issued until P.L.1967, c.79 (C.52:31B-1 et seq.) and P.L.1971,
c.362&nbsp;(C.20:4-1&nbsp;et&nbsp;seq.)&nbsp;have been complied with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The owner seeks to
retire permanently the residential building or the mobile home park from
residential use or use as a mobile home park, provided this subsection shall
not apply to circumstances covered under subsection g. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The landlord or owner
proposes, at the termination of a lease, reasonable changes of substance in the
terms and conditions of the lease, including specifically any change in the
term thereof, which the tenant, after written notice, refuses to accept;
provided that in cases where a tenant has received a notice of termination
pursuant to subsection g. of section 3 of P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.2), or has
a protected tenancy status pursuant to the &quot;Senior Citizens and Disabled
