<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning health benefits for disabled members
of the Teachers Pension and Annuity Fund and the Public Employees Retirement
System and amending P.L.2010, c.3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 10 of P.L.2010,
c.3 (C.18A:66-39.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  a.  A person who becomes
a member of the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund, N.J.S.18A:66-1 et seq., on
or after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3 shall not be eligible for an
ordinary or accidental disability retirement allowance, but shall be eligible
for disability insurance coverage pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State Treasurer is
hereby authorized and permitted to purchase from one or more insurance
companies, as determined by him, group disability benefit coverage to provide
for the disability benefit in the amounts specified herein.  The group
disability benefit coverage may be provided under one or more policies issued
to the State Treasurer specifically for this purpose or, in the discretion of
the State Treasurer, under one or more policies issued to the State Treasurer
which provide group life insurance coverage for members of the retirement
system designated in subsection a. of this section.  Any dividend or
retrospective rate credit allowed by an insurance company attributable to this
program shall be credited in an equitable manner to the funds available to meet
the employers' obligations under such retirement system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Premiums for such group
insurance coverage shall be paid from a special fund, hereby created, called
the &quot;Teachers Group Disability Insurance Premium Fund.&quot;  The State
Treasurer shall estimate annually the amount which shall be required for
premiums for such benefits for the ensuing fiscal year and shall certify such
amounts which shall be applied against the total employer contributions due for
the members of the retirement system whose members are covered, depositing such
amounts in the premium fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     During the period such group
insurance policy or policies are in effect with respect to members of the
retirement system, the State Treasurer shall in no way commingle moneys in this
fund with any retirement system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A person shall not be
allowed the group disability benefit coverage if on the date the person enrolls
in the retirement system, the person is 60 or more years of age, unless the
person furnishes satisfactory evidence of insurability and, on the effective
date of the person's enrollment, is actively at work and performing all the
regular duties at the customary place of employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The effective date of coverage
for such a benefit shall be the first day of the month which immediately
follows the date when such evidence is determined to be satisfactory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such evidence of insurability
shall not be required of any person enrolling in the retirement system upon
transfer from another retirement system, if such retirement system provided a
benefit of a similar nature and the transferring person was covered by such a benefit
at the time of the transfer.  If such transferring person was not covered by
such a benefit at the time of the transfer, the person may be allowed the
benefit under the group policy or policies; however, any such person shall
furnish satisfactory evidence of insurability if he had been unable or failed
to give such evidence as a member of the retirement system from which the
person transferred.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person who must furnish
satisfactory evidence of insurability, and who ceases to be enrolled in the
retirement system without such evidence having been given, shall continue to be
subject to the same requirement if the person subsequently becomes a member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The disability benefit
coverage provided under such group policy or policies shall provide a monthly
income if the member becomes totally disabled from occupational or
nonoccupational causes for a period of at least six consecutive months
following the effective date of the coverage.  The monthly disability benefit
may be paid by the insurance company so long as the member remains disabled up
to the seventieth birthday, provided the disability commenced prior to the
sixtieth birthday.  The benefit shall terminate when the member is no longer
considered totally disabled or begins to receive retirement benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The member shall be considered
totally disabled if the member is unable to perform each duty of the member's
occupation and is under the regular care of a physician.  After the 12 months
following the commencement of such disability benefit payments, the member
shall be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for which the member is
reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.  Total disability shall
not be considered to exist if the member is gainfully employed.  Following an agreement
with the insurance company and the policyholder, the member may continue to
receive disability benefits for a limited time while performing some type of
work.  During the period of rehabilitation, the monthly benefit shall be the
regular payment less 80% of the member's earnings from such rehabilitative
position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A member shall be
deemed to be in service and covered by the disability benefit insurance
provisions for a period of no more than six months while on official leave of
absence without pay if satisfactory evidence is presented to the Division of
Pensions and Benefits that such leave of absence without pay is due to illness
and that the member was not actively engaged in any gainful occupation during
such period of leave of absence without pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Disability benefit insurance
provisions of the group policy or policies shall not cover disability resulting
from or contributed to by pregnancy, act of war, intentionally self-inflicted
injury, or attempted suicide whether or not sane.  For purposes of such
disability benefit coverage, the member shall not be considered to be disabled
while the member is imprisoned or while outside the United States, its
territories or possessions, or Canada.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the member has recovered
from the disability for which the member had received benefits and again
becomes totally disabled while insured, the later disability shall be regarded
as a continuation of the prior one unless the member has returned to full-time
covered employment for at least six months.  If the later absence is due to an
unrelated cause and the member had returned to full-time work, it shall be
considered a new disability.  The disability benefit insurance cannot be

for the disability benefit in the amounts specified herein.  The group
disability benefit coverage may be provided under one or more policies issued
to the State Treasurer specifically for this purpose or, in the discretion of
the State Treasurer, under one or more policies issued to the State Treasurer
which provide group life insurance coverage for members of the retirement

covered by such a benefit at the time of the transfer, the person may be

may be paid by the insurance company so long as the member remains disabled up
to the seventieth birthday, provided the disability commenced prior to the
sixtieth birthday.  The benefit shall terminate when the member is no longer
considered totally disabled or begins to receive retirement benefits.</p>

occupation and is under the regular care of a physician.  After the 12 months
following the commencement of such disability benefit payments, the member
shall be unable to engage in any gainful occupation for which the member is
reasonably fitted by education, training or experience.  Total disability shall
not be considered to exist if the member is gainfully employed.  Following an
agreement with the insurance company and the policyholder, the member may
continue to receive disability benefits for a limited time while performing
some type of work.  During the period of rehabilitation, the monthly benefit

unrelated cause and the member had returned to full-time work, it shall be
