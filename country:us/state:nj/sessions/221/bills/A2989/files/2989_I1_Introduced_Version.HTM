particular, the bill adjusts for inflation:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     -
the minimum taxable income threshold to be subject to the gross income tax, and
the minimum taxable income threshold to file a gross income tax return. The minimum
taxable income threshold for both is currently $10,000 for individuals who are
single or married filing separately and $20,000 for married filing jointly.

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     -
the income limitation on the credit allowed pursuant to the Wounded Warrior
Caregivers Relief Act. That credit is currently limited to those with gross
income not exceeding $50,000 or $100,000 if filing jointly. Those amounts will
be adjusted annually for inflation beginning with tax year 2022.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=HangingAnActChar>     -
the income limitation on the credit for expenses for household and dependent
care services. That credit is equal to a percentage that the taxpayer is
allowed under the federal income tax, but is reduced and phased out as the

estimated income tax payments, the income threshold for additional estimated
payments to avoid incurring underpayment penalties. Because

estimated tax. If a taxpayer makes payments equal to 100 percent of the

the income tax brackets and tax amounts per bracket under the optional
pass-through business alternative income tax. These income tax brackets and tax
amounts per bracket are currently structured to approximate tax liability under
the gross income tax. The income tax brackets and tax amounts per bracket will
be adjusted annually for inflation beginning with tax year 2022 to conform with
the changes to the gross income tax brackets and tax amounts per bracket
proposed in Senate Bill No. 676 of the 2022-2023 session.</span></p>
