S1048 SENATE, No. 1048 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Directs DEP to establish rebate program for purchase of microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter; appropriates $2.5 million. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning microfiber washing machine filters, supplementing Title 13 of the Revised Statutes, and making an appropriation. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  No later than one year after the effective date of this section, the Department of Environmental Protection shall establish and implement a program to provide rebates to residents of the State for the purchase of a microfiber washing machine filter or a replacement microfiber washing machine filter.  The purpose of the rebate program shall be to encourage the purchase of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters and reduce the amount of microfiber pollution in the State. b.  The department shall issue a one-time rebate to any resident of the State who purchases an eligible microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter, as determined by the department, submits a complete application for the rebate, in a manner and form determined by the department, and meets the requirements set forth in this section and in any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto by the department pursuant to subsection f. of this section. c.  The amount of the rebate shall not exceed the lesser of: (1) the cost of the microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter; or (2) $100. d.  The department shall determine the types or brands of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters that are eligible for the rebate provided pursuant to this section and the manner and form for residents to apply for and, if eligible, receive a rebate pursuant to this section. e.  The department shall advertise the availability of rebates pursuant to this section on its Internet website and update the information as necessary. f.  The department shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the implementation of the rebate program established pursuant to this section. g.    No later than two years after the effective date of this act, and annually thereafter, the department shall prepare and submit to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature, a report that includes, at a minimum: (1) a summary of the effectiveness of the rebate program in encouraging the purchase of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters and minimizing microfiber pollution in the State; (2) the total number of rebates provided during the year; (3) the total amount of money spent on the provision of rebates during the year; (4) the amount of funding still available for the provision of rebates in future years; (5) recommendations to improve the rebate programs effectiveness; and (6) recommendations concerning whether or not additional funding is needed to continue the rebate program. h.    As used in this section: Department means the Department of Environmental Protection. Microfiber washing machine filter means a device that attaches to a washing machine and is used to filter microfibers from the washing machine wastewater before the microfibers are released into a septic system or public sewage system. 2.    There is appropriated from the General Fund to the Department of Environmental Protection the sum of $2.5 million for the purposes of providing rebates pursuant to the program established in section 1 of this act. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require, no later than one year after the bills effective date, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to establish and implement a program to provide rebates to State residents for the purchase of a microfiber washing machine filter or a replacement microfiber washing machine filter.  The purpose of the rebate program would be to encourage the purchase of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters and reduce the amount of microfiber pollution in the State.  As defined in the bill, microfiber washing machine filter means a device that attaches to a washing machine and is used to filter microfibers from the washing machine wastewater before the microfibers are released into a septic system or public sewage system. Under the bill, one-time rebates would be available to any resident of the State who purchases an eligible microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter, as determined by the DEP, submits a complete application for the rebate, in a manner and form determined by the DEP, and meets the bills requirements.  The amount of the rebate would not exceed the lesser of:  (1) the cost of the microfiber washing machine filter or replacement filter; or (2) $100. The DEP would be required to determine the types or brands of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters that are eligible for the rebate, determine the manner and form for residents to apply for and, if eligible, receive a rebate, and adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement the rebate program established by the bill.  The DEP would be required to advertise the availability of the rebates offered pursuant to the bill on their Internet website.  The bill would also require, no later than two years after the bills effective date, and annually thereafter, the DEP to prepare and submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature that includes, at a minimum:  (1) a summary of the effectiveness of the rebate program in encouraging the purchase of microfiber washing machine filters and replacement filters and minimizing microfiber pollution in the State; (2) the total number of rebates provided during the year; (3) the total amount of money spent on the provision of rebates during the year; (4) the amount of funding still available for the provision of rebates in future years; (5) recommendations to improve the rebate programs effectiveness; and (6) recommendations concerning whether or not additional funding is needed to continue the rebate program. Finally, the bill would appropriate $2.5 million from the General Fund to the DEP for the purposes of providing rebates pursuant to the rebate program established by the bill. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), it is estimated that more than eight million tons of plastic enter our oceans every year.  A leading source of this pollution is clothing and textiles.  The majority of clothing is made from plastic-based materials such as polyester, rayon, nylon, and acrylic.  When washed in a washing machine, synthetic clothing sheds tiny plastic fragments known as microfibers, which eventually end up contaminating shorelines and waterways.  Microfibers are the most prevalent type of microplastic (plastic pieces less than 5 mm in diameter) found in the environment.  Microfibers have been found in a variety of aquatic life, including fish and shellfish, and humans are exposed to microplastics through the consumption of food and water containing microplastics. The EPA recommends the installation of a microfiber washing machine filter to reduce the amount of microfibers that flow from washing machines to waterways.  Certain microfiber washing machine filter manufacturers report that their product is able to prevent the release of up to 90 percent of microfibers that would otherwise be released during the process of doing laundry.  It is crucial to take steps to minimize microfiber pollution in the State, and this bill will help to encourage the purchase of a product that can limit the amount of microfibers that enter the States waters.
