<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)   a.  (1) 
A federal, State, or local government entity may move for a stay of any
proceeding to recover possession of or quiet title to real property relating to
a residential dwelling unit or property, based on a pending good faith
investigation into the theft or fraud in the title to, or the financing of, the
premises that is the subject of the proceeding.  Upon the agency's showing of
the pendency of a good faith investigation, the court shall issue a stay of the
proceeding, including staying execution of a warrant of eviction or enforcement
of a judgment so long as the investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Every six months, the
court shall schedule a status conference with the government agency and any
other parties to the action to review any stay and to determine if the
investigation is still continuing in good faith and shall continue the stay of
the proceeding until the government investigation is closed.  A court may, in
its discretion, review any supporting documents filed by the government entity
in camera and to be filed under seal if deemed necessary by the government
entity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The court shall stay all
proceedings:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   to recover possession of
or quiet title to real property relating to a residential dwelling unit or
property, where a criminal complaint is filed against a party to the proceeding
for deed theft, larceny, offering a false document for filing, criminal
possession of stolen property or any other law asserting theft or fraud in
obtaining title to property and the criminal complaint relates to the premises
that is the subject of the proceeding.  The stay shall remain in effect until
resolution of the criminal action;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   to recover possession of
or quiet title to real property relating to a residential dwelling unit or
property, where a federal, state or local government entity has commenced a
civil action or proceeding relating to the theft or fraud in the title to, or
the financing of, the premises that is the subject of the proceeding; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   relating to any
landlord-tenant action before the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
Special Civil Part, or before the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division,
if the action was removed to the Law Division pursuant to N.J.S.2A:18-60 for 90
days to allow a party to file a complaint in the appropriate forum when the
court makes a determination that there is a bona fide dispute between parties
purporting to own the property that is the subject of the proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A rebuttable
presumption that a bona fide dispute to title exists shall be created when the
party disputing petitioner's title, owns or owned the property that is the
subject of the court proceeding during the last three years, or is a person
interested in the property.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A party may seek an
additional stay of the proceeding beyond the initial 90 day stay by the court
if the party was unable to file a complaint or seek a stay from another forum. 
In extending the stay, the court shall consider, without limitation, the
totality of the circumstances including steps the parties have taken to resolve
the dispute, the harm to the parties of a further stay, and the ability of the
parties to advocate for themselves or retain counsel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     This section shall not
apply to any proceeding commenced against a person in possession who has
entered the property or remains in possession by force or unlawful means and the
person or the persons predecessor in interest was not in quiet possession for
three years before the time of the forcible or unlawful entry or detainer and
the petitioner was peaceably in actual possession at the time of the forcible
or unlawful entry or in constructive possession at the time of the forcible or
unlawful detainer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Nothing in this section
shall diminish the court's own discretion to further stay a proceeding in the
interests of justice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Nothing in this section
shall limit a party from seeking relief, including a stay of a proceeding, in
another court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    For purposes of this
section, a proceeding to recover possession of or quiet title to real property
shall include an ejectment action or a writ of possession, a foreclosure
action, an action to enforce a mortgage note, or any other action affecting
title to or encumbrance upon real property, or any other judicial or
administrative proceeding to recover possession of or quiet title to real
property. </p>

section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Party means a corporation,

a person has been convicted of a criminal offense in connection with a deed
theft or fraudulent transaction involving real property, the conviction shall
create a rebuttable presumption that the deed transfer was fraudulent.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    This section shall also
apply where a grantee of a fraudulent deed is an entity that is beneficially
owned by the convicted person.  A defendant may produce proof to establish by a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill implements certain
protections against deed theft.  First, the bill provides that a federal,
State, or local government entity may move for a stay of any proceeding to
recover possession of or quiet title to real property relating to a residential
dwelling unit or property, if there is a pending good faith investigation into
the theft or fraud in the title to, or the financing of, the premises that is
the subject of the proceeding.  Upon the agency's showing of the pendency of a
good faith investigation, the court is required to issue a stay of the
proceeding, including staying execution of a warrant of eviction or enforcement
of a judgment so long as the investigation is ongoing.  The bill stipulates
that every six months, the court is required to schedule a status conference
with the government agency and any other parties to the action to review any
stay and to determine if the investigation is still continuing in good faith
and is further required continue the stay of the proceeding until the government
investigation is closed.  A court may, in its discretion, review any supporting
documents filed by the government entity in camera and to be filed under seal
if deemed necessary by the government entity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the court is
required to stay all proceedings;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   to recover possession of
or quiet title to real property relating to a residential dwelling unit or
property, where a criminal complaint is filed against a party to the proceeding
for deed theft, larceny, offering a false document for filing, criminal
possession of stolen property or any other law asserting theft or fraud in
obtaining title to property and the criminal complaint relates to the premises
that is the subject of the proceeding.  The stay is to remain in effect until resolution
of the criminal action:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   to recover possession of
or quiet title to real property relating to a residential dwelling unit or
property, where a federal, state or local government entity has commenced a
civil action or proceeding relating to the theft or fraud in the title to, or
the financing of, the premises that is the subject of the proceeding; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   relating to any
landlord-tenant action for 90 days to allow a party to file a complaint in the
appropriate forum when the court makes a determination that there is a bona
fide dispute between parties purporting to own the property that is the subject
of the proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of the bill
concerning the stay of proceedings do not apply to proceedings commenced
against a person in possession who has entered the property or remains in
possession by force or unlawful means and the person or the persons
predecessor in interest was not in quiet possession for three years before the
time of the forcible or unlawful entry or detainer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, where a person
has been convicted of a criminal offense in connection with a deed theft or
fraudulent transaction involving real property, the conviction creates a
rebuttable presumption that the deed transfer was fraudulent.  This applies
where a grantee of a fraudulent deed is an entity that is beneficially owned by
the convicted person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, in
cases where a defendant has been convicted after a trial or pled guilty to any
crime that affects the title to, encumbrance of, or possession of, real
property and where there is an instrument that is material to the encumbrance,
transfer, or purchase of the real property, the Attorney General or any law
enforcement agency may file a motion in Superior Court in the county where the
property that is the subject of the instrument is located or the prosecution
occurred, on behalf of the victim to void the instrument.  The Superior Court
is required to conduct a hearing and make findings of essential to the
determination whether to declare the instrument void.  Upon the defendants
conviction of or guilty plea, and after conducting a hearing pursuant to the
bill, the court is required to make a determination, and if appropriate, order
that the instrument be declared void or grant other appropriate relief to the
victim.  </p>
