<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides an
exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax (PPGRT) and the motor
fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of certain school buses clarifies the
tax treatment of certain dyed fuel under the PPGRT, and clarifies the
determination of taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of
the estate tax.   The bill also excludes the exemptions and these clarifying
changes from the review of legislative actions by the three-member review
council established by P.L.2016, c.57, to prevent a cessation in the imposition
of one of the components of the petroleum products gross receipts tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>     Fuel Used for Certain
School Buses.</i>  The bill provides an exemption from the petroleum products
gross receipts tax and the motor fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of
certain school buses.  Under the bill, the exemption applies to fuel used for
school buses operated for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a
school-sponsored activity or event by a religious or charitable organization or
corporation or by a person under contract with a public or governmental agency
or a religious or other charitable organization or corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To receive the benefit of the
exemption, purchasers of fuel used to operate a school bus for the
transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or
event must pay tax at the point of purchase and seek a refund of the taxes paid
by the filing of a claim with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury.  As is required under current law for certain other
exempt uses of fuel, the claim for refund must be filed with the director by
the purchaser providing proof that the tax has been paid, and the director must
confirm that a refunds has not been previously issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines school
buses by reference to the definition of school bus under R.S.39:1-1.  Under
that section of law, a school bus is any motor vehicle operated by, or under
contract with, a public or governmental agency, or religious or other
charitable organization or corporation, or privately operated for the
transportation of children to or from school for secular or religious
education, which complies with the regulations of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle
Commission affecting school buses, and includes School Vehicle Type I and
School Vehicle Type II.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, consumers
of fuel that are eligible for an exemption from the petroleum products gross
receipts tax and the motor fuel tax must pay the tax at the point of purchase
and seek a refund of the taxes paid by the filing of a claim with the Director
of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The law
provides that the claim for refund must be filed by the consumer providing
proof that the tax has been paid and a refund has not been previously issued.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Treatment of Dyed Fuel
under PPGRT.</i>  The bill clarifies the tax treatment of certain dyed fuel
under the petroleum products gross receipts tax.  Under the bill, dyed fuel is
excluded from the definition of gross receipts so that receipts from sales of
dyed fuel (unless used in a motor vehicle for operation on the public highways)
are explicitly exempt from tax and recognized in a similar form and manner as
dyed fuel is recognized for purposes of the motor fuel tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the motor fuel tax, dyed
fuel is dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene that is required to be dyed pursuant
to United States Environmental Protection Agency rules or is dyed pursuant
Internal Revenue Service rules or any other requirements set by those federal
agencies.  Fuel is dyed to easily identify fuel that has not been subjected to
federal highway tax.  The motor fuel tax recognizes that dyed fuel can
generally only be used for an exempt public purpose, and prohibits dyed fuel
sold for an exempt purpose from being used in a taxable manner through the
imposition of certain fines and penalties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Determination of Taxable
Estates of Resident Decedents.</i>  The bill clarifies the determination of
taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of the estate tax. 
Under the bill, the taxable estate of each resident decedent dying on or after
January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, is to be determined based upon the
taxable estate of the decedent for federal estate tax purposes but without the
deduction of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid
to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia as
is otherwise allowed pursuant to section 2058 of the federal Internal Revenue
Code in effect on January 1, 2017.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The disallowance of the
deduction will limit the potential of a tax benefit that estates of resident
decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, might
claim for any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to
any state or (territory of the United States or District of Columbia). 
Currently, the law directs the estate tax to be determined based upon the
federal taxable estate (which is the decedents gross estate minus certain
deductions, including the deduction for estate, inheritance, legacy, or
succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States
or the District of Columbia), and provides that the resident decedents tax
liability is to further be reduced by a credit for a proportion of those same
taxes actually paid to any state in respect to property in another state owned
by the decedent or subject to those taxes as part of or in connection with the
estate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <i>Exclusion from Review by
the Review Council.</i>  The bill excludes the exemptions and the clarifying
changes from the review of the three member review council established by
P.L.2016, c.57 to prevent a cessation in the imposition of one of the
components of the PPGRT.  Under the bill, the provisions of current law that
direct the three-member review council to review legislative actions and issue
certifications to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the scheduled
implementation of P.L.2016, c.57 might otherwise be impeded will not apply to
those sections of the bill that exempt fuel used for certain school buses and
clarify treatment of dyed fuel and the determination of taxable estates of
resident decedents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the three
member review council (i.e. the State Treasurer, Legislative Budget and Finance
Officer, and a third public member) is directed to monitor the actions of the
Legislature on an ongoing basis for interference with the implementation of
P.L.2016, c.57.  If the implementation is impeded, the council is to certify
this interference to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the director
is to effectuate the cessation of the imposition of one of the components of
the PPGRT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>     <i>Effective
Date.</i>  The bill is scheduled to take effect immediately upon enactment, but
provides for the exemption and clarification to the treatment of dyed fuel to
apply to the fuel used on or after the first day of the first month next
following enactment.  The bill provides for the clarification of the
determination of taxable estates to apply retroactively to estates of resident
decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017.</p>
