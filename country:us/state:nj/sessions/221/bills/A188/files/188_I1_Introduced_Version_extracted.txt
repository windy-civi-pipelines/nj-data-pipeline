Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 7 of P.L.1991, c.181 (C.54:15B-2.1) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a.  "Gross receipts," as otherwise defined by section 2 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-2), shall not include:  (1) receipts from sales of petroleum products used by marine vessels engaged in interstate or foreign commerce [and] ; (2) receipts from sales of aviation fuels used by common carriers in interstate or foreign commerce other than the "burnout" portion which shall be taxable pursuant to rules promulgated by the director; and (3) receipts from sales of dyed fuel as defined by section 2 of P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-102), unless used in a motor vehicle for operation on the public highways. b.  Highway fuel used for the following purposes is exempt from the tax imposed by section 3 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-3), and a refund of the tax imposed by that section may be claimed by the consumer providing proof the tax has been paid and no refund has been previously issued: (1)   autobuses while being operated over the highways of this State in those municipalities to which the operator has paid a monthly franchise tax for the use of the streets therein under the provisions of R.S.48:16-25 and autobuses while being operated over the highways of this State in a regular route bus operation as defined in R.S.48:4-1 and under operating authority conferred pursuant to R.S.48:4-3, or while providing bus service under a contract with the New Jersey Transit Corporation or under a contract with a county for special or rural transportation bus service subject to the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Transit Corporation pursuant to P.L.1979, c.150 (C.27:25-1 et seq.), and autobuses providing commuter bus service which receive or discharge passengers in New Jersey.  For the purpose of this paragraph "commuter bus service" means regularly scheduled passenger service provided by motor vehicles whether within or across the geographical boundaries of New Jersey and utilized by passengers using reduced fare, multiple ride, or commutation tickets and shall not include charter bus operations for the transportation of enrolled children and adults referred to in subsection c. of R.S.48:4-1 and "regular route service" does not mean a regular route in the nature of special bus operation or a casino bus operation; (2)   agricultural tractors not operated on a public highway; (3)   farm machinery; (4)   ambulances; (5)   rural free delivery carriers in the dispatch of their official business; (6)   vehicles that run only on rails or tracks, and such vehicles as run in substitution therefor; (7)   highway motor vehicles that are operated exclusively on private property; (8)   motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for or in the propagation, planting, preservation and gathering of oysters and clams in the tidal waters of this State; (9)   motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for commercial fishing; (10)  motor boats or motor vessels, while being used for hire for fishing parties or being used for sightseeing or excursion parties; (11)  fire engines and fire-fighting apparatus; (12) stationary machinery and vehicles or implements not designed for the use of transporting persons or property on the public highways; (13)  heating and lighting devices; (14)  motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for Sea Scout training by a duly chartered unit of the Boy Scouts of America; [and] (15)  emergency vehicles used exclusively by volunteer first-aid or rescue squads; and (16)  school buses operated for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event by a religious or other charitable organization or corporation or by a person under contract with a public or governmental agency or a religious or other charitable organization or corporation.  For the purpose of this paragraph school buses means school bus as that term is defined by R.S.39:1-1.

The exemption pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be claimed by a deduction on the report of the supplier which is otherwise responsible for remitting the tax upon removal of the product from a terminal or refinery in this State.

(3)  (a)  Upon the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, whether or not subject to an estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.), the amount of the taxable estate, determined pursuant to section 2051 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.2051), but without the deduction of any estate inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia pursuant to the provisions of section 2058 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s. 2058) in effect on January 1, 2017, shall be subject to tax pursuant to the following schedule: On any amount up to $100,000 .................................................0.0% On any amount in excess of $100,000, up to $150,000  . . . . 0.8% of the excess over $100,000 On any amount in excess of $150,000, up to $200,000. . . . . . $400 plus 1.6% of the excess over $150,000 On any amount in excess of $200,000, up to $300,000. . . . . . . . .  $1,200 plus 2.4% of the excess over $200,000 On any amount in excess of $300,000, up to $500,000. . . . . . . . .  $3,600 plus 3.2% of the excess over $300,000 On any amount in excess of $500,000, up to $700,000. . . . . . . . .  $10,000 plus 4.0% of the excess over $500,000 On any amount in excess of $700,000, up to $900,000. . . . . . . . .  $18,000 plus 4.8% of the excess over $700,000 On any amount in excess of $900,000, up to $1,100,000. . . . . . . .  $27,600 plus 5.6% of the excess over $900,000 On any amount in excess of $1,100,000, up to $1,600,000. . . . $38,800 plus 6.4% of the excess over $1,100,000 On any amount in excess of $1,600,000, up to $2,100,000. . . . . $70,800 plus 7.2% of the excess over $1,600,000 On any amount in excess of $2,100,000, up to $2,600,000. . . . . $106,800 plus 8.0% of the excess over $2,100,000 On any amount in excess of $2,600,000, up to $3,100,000. . . . $146,800 plus 8.8% of the excess over $2,600,000 On any amount in excess of $3,100,000, up to $3,600,000. . . . . $190,800 plus 9.6% of the excess over $3,100,000 On any amount in excess of $3,600,000, up to $4,100,000. . . . . $238,800 plus 10.4% of the excess over $3,600,000 On any amount in excess of $4,100,000, up to $5,100,000. . . . . $290,800 plus 11.2% of the excess over $4,100,000 On any amount in excess of $5,100,000, up to $6,100,000 . . . . $402,800 plus 12.0% of the excess over $5,100,000 On any amount in excess of $6,100,000, up to $7,100,000 . . . . . $522,800 plus 12.8% of the excess over $6,100,000 On any amount in excess of $7,100,000, up to $8,100,000 . . . . . $650,800 plus 13.6% of the excess over $7,100,000 On any amount in excess of $8,100,000, up to $9,100,000 . . . . .  $786,800 plus 14.4% of the excess over $8,100,000 On any amount in excess of $9,100,000, up to $10,100,000 . . . . $930,800 plus 15.2% of the excess over $9,100,000 On any amount in excess of $10,100,000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,082,800 plus 16.0% of the excess over $10,100,000 (b)   A credit shall be allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph equal to the amount of tax which would be determined by subparagraph (a) of this paragraph if the amount of the taxable estate were equal to the exclusion amount. For the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, the exclusion amount is $2,000,000. (c)   The amount of tax liability of a resident decedent determined pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of all estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, including inheritance taxes actually paid this State, in respect to any property owned by that decedent or subject to those taxes as a part of or in connection with the estate; provided however, that the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this subsection that the amount of the estate's property subject to tax by other jurisdictions bears to the entire estate taxable under this chapter. (4)   For the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2018, there shall be no tax imposed. b.  (1)  In the case of the estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 2002 where no inheritance, succession or legacy tax is due this State under the provisions of chapters 33 to 36 of this title or under authority of any subsequent enactment imposing taxes of a similar nature, but an estate tax is due the United States under the provisions of any federal revenue act in effect as of the date of death, wherein provision is made for a credit on account of taxes paid the several states or territories of the United States, or the District of Columbia, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be the maximum amount of such credit less the aggregate amount of such estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia. (2)   In the case of the estate of a decedent dying after December 31, 2001, but before January 1, 2017, where no inheritance, succession or legacy tax is due this State under the provisions of chapters 33 to 36 of this title or under authority of any subsequent enactment imposing taxes of a similar nature, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section. (3)   In the case of the estate of a decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017 the tax imposed by this chapter shall be determined pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection a. of this section. c.     For the purposes of this section, a "simplified tax system" to produce a liability similar to the liability determined pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section is a tax system that is based upon the $675,000 unified estate and gift tax applicable exclusion amount in effect under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2001, and results in general in the determination of a similar amount of tax but which will enable the person or corporation liable for the payment of the tax to calculate an amount of tax notwithstanding the lack or paucity of information for compliance due to such factors as the absence of an estate valuation made for federal estate tax purposes, the absence of a measure of the impact of gifts made during the lifetime of the decedent in the absence of federal gift tax information, and any other information compliance problems as the director determines are the result of the phased repeal of the federal estate tax. (cf: P.L.2016, c.57, s.7) 4.  Section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) is amended to read as follows: 19.  a.  The State Treasurer, and the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, together with a third public member who shall be jointly selected thereby, shall constitute the review council. b.    The review council shall, on or before January 15, 2020, provide the Governor and the Legislature with an advisory report of their consensus estimate of the increase or decrease in State revenues pursuant to each section of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.), and pursuant to this act as a whole, during the preceding three State fiscal years, including a comparison of those estimates to the legislative fiscal estimate or fiscal note published contemporaneous with the enactment of this act prepared pursuant to P.L.1980, c.67 (C.52:13B-6 et seq.). c.     The review council shall conduct an ongoing review of the application of each section of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.). The review council shall, not later than five days after any Legislative action that halts, delays, or reverses the implementation of those sections as scheduled on the date of enactment of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.), certify for the purposes of subparagraph (h) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-3) to the Director of the Division of Taxation that the scheduled implementation of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.) had been impeded. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to sections 1, 2, and 3 of P.L.    , c.   (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill. (cf:  P.L.2016, c.57, s.19) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately; provided however that sections 1 and 2 shall apply to highway fuel and fuel used on or after the first day of the first month next following the date of enactment and section 3 shall apply retroactively to the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017. STATEMENT This bill provides an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax (PPGRT) and the motor fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of certain school buses clarifies the tax treatment of certain dyed fuel under the PPGRT, and clarifies the determination of taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of the estate tax.   The bill also excludes the exemptions and these clarifying changes from the review of legislative actions by the three-member review council established by P.L.2016, c.57, to prevent a cessation in the imposition of one of the components of the petroleum products gross receipts tax. Fuel Used for Certain School Buses.  The bill provides an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax and the motor fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of certain school buses.  Under the bill, the exemption applies to fuel used for school buses operated for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event by a religious or charitable organization or corporation or by a person under contract with a public or governmental agency or a religious or other charitable organization or corporation. To receive the benefit of the exemption, purchasers of fuel used to operate a school bus for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event must pay tax at the point of purchase and seek a refund of the taxes paid by the filing of a claim with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  As is required under current law for certain other exempt uses of fuel, the claim for refund must be filed with the director by the purchaser providing proof that the tax has been paid, and the director must confirm that a refunds has not been previously issued. The bill defines school buses by reference to the definition of school bus under R.S.39:1-1.  Under that section of law, a school bus is any motor vehicle operated by, or under contract with, a public or governmental agency, or religious or other charitable organization or corporation, or privately operated for the transportation of children to or from school for secular or religious education, which complies with the regulations of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission affecting school buses, and includes School Vehicle Type I and School Vehicle Type II. Under current law, consumers of fuel that are eligible for an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax and the motor fuel tax must pay the tax at the point of purchase and seek a refund of the taxes paid by the filing of a claim with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The law provides that the claim for refund must be filed by the consumer providing proof that the tax has been paid and a refund has not been previously issued. Treatment of Dyed Fuel under PPGRT.  The bill clarifies the tax treatment of certain dyed fuel under the petroleum products gross receipts tax.  Under the bill, dyed fuel is excluded from the definition of gross receipts so that receipts from sales of dyed fuel (unless used in a motor vehicle for operation on the public highways) are explicitly exempt from tax and recognized in a similar form and manner as dyed fuel is recognized for purposes of the motor fuel tax. Under the motor fuel tax, dyed fuel is dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene that is required to be dyed pursuant to United States Environmental Protection Agency rules or is dyed pursuant Internal Revenue Service rules or any other requirements set by those federal agencies.  Fuel is dyed to easily identify fuel that has not been subjected to federal highway tax.  The motor fuel tax recognizes that dyed fuel can generally only be used for an exempt public purpose, and prohibits dyed fuel sold for an exempt purpose from being used in a taxable manner through the imposition of certain fines and penalties. Determination of Taxable Estates of Resident Decedents.  The bill clarifies the determination of taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of the estate tax. Under the bill, the taxable estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, is to be determined based upon the taxable estate of the decedent for federal estate tax purposes but without the deduction of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia as is otherwise allowed pursuant to section 2058 of the federal Internal Revenue Code in effect on January 1, 2017. The disallowance of the deduction will limit the potential of a tax benefit that estates of resident decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, might claim for any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or (territory of the United States or District of Columbia). Currently, the law directs the estate tax to be determined based upon the federal taxable estate (which is the decedents gross estate minus certain deductions, including the deduction for estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia), and provides that the resident decedents tax liability is to further be reduced by a credit for a proportion of those same taxes actually paid to any state in respect to property in another state owned by the decedent or subject to those taxes as part of or in connection with the estate. Exclusion from Review by the Review Council.  The bill excludes the exemptions and the clarifying changes from the review of the three member review council established by P.L.2016, c.57 to prevent a cessation in the imposition of one of the components of the PPGRT.  Under the bill, the provisions of current law that direct the three-member review council to review legislative actions and issue certifications to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the scheduled implementation of P.L.2016, c.57 might otherwise be impeded will not apply to those sections of the bill that exempt fuel used for certain school buses and clarify treatment of dyed fuel and the determination of taxable estates of resident decedents. Under current law, the three member review council (i.e. the State Treasurer, Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, and a third public member) is directed to monitor the actions of the Legislature on an ongoing basis for interference with the implementation of P.L.2016, c.57.  If the implementation is impeded, the council is to certify this interference to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the director is to effectuate the cessation of the imposition of one of the components of the PPGRT. Effective Date.  The bill is scheduled to take effect immediately upon enactment, but provides for the exemption and clarification to the treatment of dyed fuel to apply to the fuel used on or after the first day of the first month next following enactment.  The bill provides for the clarification of the determination of taxable estates to apply retroactively to estates of resident decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017.

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 7 of P.L.1991, c.181 (C.54:15B-2.1) is amended to read as follows: 7.  a.  "Gross receipts," as otherwise defined by section 2 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-2), shall not include:  (1) receipts from sales of petroleum products used by marine vessels engaged in interstate or foreign commerce [and] ; (2) receipts from sales of aviation fuels used by common carriers in interstate or foreign commerce other than the "burnout" portion which shall be taxable pursuant to rules promulgated by the director; and (3) receipts from sales of dyed fuel as defined by section 2 of P.L.2010, c.22 (C.54:39-102), unless used in a motor vehicle for operation on the public highways. b.  Highway fuel used for the following purposes is exempt from the tax imposed by section 3 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-3), and a refund of the tax imposed by that section may be claimed by the consumer providing proof the tax has been paid and no refund has been previously issued: (1)   autobuses while being operated over the highways of this State in those municipalities to which the operator has paid a monthly franchise tax for the use of the streets therein under the provisions of R.S.48:16-25 and autobuses while being operated over the highways of this State in a regular route bus operation as defined in R.S.48:4-1 and under operating authority conferred pursuant to R.S.48:4-3, or while providing bus service under a contract with the New Jersey Transit Corporation or under a contract with a county for special or rural transportation bus service subject to the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Transit Corporation pursuant to P.L.1979, c.150 (C.27:25-1 et seq.), and autobuses providing commuter bus service which receive or discharge passengers in New Jersey.  For the purpose of this paragraph "commuter bus service" means regularly scheduled passenger service provided by motor vehicles whether within or across the geographical boundaries of New Jersey and utilized by passengers using reduced fare, multiple ride, or commutation tickets and shall not include charter bus operations for the transportation of enrolled children and adults referred to in subsection c. of R.S.48:4-1 and "regular route service" does not mean a regular route in the nature of special bus operation or a casino bus operation; (2)   agricultural tractors not operated on a public highway; (3)   farm machinery; (4)   ambulances; (5)   rural free delivery carriers in the dispatch of their official business; (6)   vehicles that run only on rails or tracks, and such vehicles as run in substitution therefor; (7)   highway motor vehicles that are operated exclusively on private property; (8)   motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for or in the propagation, planting, preservation and gathering of oysters and clams in the tidal waters of this State; (9)   motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for commercial fishing; (10)  motor boats or motor vessels, while being used for hire for fishing parties or being used for sightseeing or excursion parties; (11)  fire engines and fire-fighting apparatus; (12) stationary machinery and vehicles or implements not designed for the use of transporting persons or property on the public highways; (13)  heating and lighting devices; (14)  motor boats or motor vessels used exclusively for Sea Scout training by a duly chartered unit of the Boy Scouts of America; [and] (15)  emergency vehicles used exclusively by volunteer first-aid or rescue squads; and (16)  school buses operated for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event by a religious or other charitable organization or corporation or by a person under contract with a public or governmental agency or a religious or other charitable organization or corporation.  For the purpose of this paragraph school buses means school bus as that term is defined by R.S.39:1-1.

The exemption pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be claimed by a deduction on the report of the supplier which is otherwise responsible for remitting the tax upon removal of the product from a terminal or refinery in this State.

(cf: P.L.2015, c.101, s.2) 3.  R.S.54:38-1 is amended to read as follows: 54:38-1.  a.  In addition to the inheritance, succession or legacy taxes imposed by this State under authority of chapters 33 to 36 of this title (R.S.54:33-1 et seq.), or hereafter imposed under authority of any subsequent enactment, there is hereby imposed an estate or transfer tax: (1)   Upon the transfer of the estate of every resident decedent dying before January 1, 2002 which is subject to an estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the federal revenue act of one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six and the amendments thereof and supplements thereto or any other federal revenue act in effect as of the date of death of the decedent, the amount of which tax shall be the sum by which the maximum credit allowable against any federal estate tax payable to the United States under any federal revenue act on account of taxes paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, shall exceed the aggregate amount of all estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, including inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid this State, in respect to any property owned by such decedent or subject to such taxes as a part of or in connection with the estate; and (2)  (a)  Upon the transfer of the estate of every resident decedent dying after December 31, 2001, but before January 1, 2017, which would have been subject to an estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2001, the amount of which tax shall be, at the election of the person or corporation liable for the payment of the tax under this chapter, either (i)    the maximum credit that would have been allowable under the provisions of that federal Internal Revenue Code in effect on that date against the federal estate tax that would have been payable under the provisions of that federal Internal Revenue Code in effect on that date on account of taxes paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, or (ii)   determined pursuant to the simplified tax system as may be prescribed by the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to produce a liability similar to the liability determined pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph reduced pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection. (b)   The amount of tax liability determined pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of all estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, including inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid this State, in respect to any property owned by such decedent or subject to such taxes as a part of or in connection with the estate; provided however, that the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this subsection that the amount of the estates's property subject to tax by other jurisdictions bears to the entire estate taxable under this chapter. (3)  (a)  Upon the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, whether or not subject to an estate tax payable to the United States under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.), the amount of the taxable estate, determined pursuant to section 2051 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.2051), but without the deduction of any estate inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia pursuant to the provisions of section 2058 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s. 2058) in effect on January 1, 2017, shall be subject to tax pursuant to the following schedule: On any amount up to $100,000 .................................................0.0% On any amount in excess of $100,000, up to $150,000  . . . . 0.8% of the excess over $100,000 On any amount in excess of $150,000, up to $200,000. . . . . . $400 plus 1.6% of the excess over $150,000 On any amount in excess of $200,000, up to $300,000. . . . . . . . .  $1,200 plus 2.4% of the excess over $200,000 On any amount in excess of $300,000, up to $500,000. . . . . . . . .  $3,600 plus 3.2% of the excess over $300,000 On any amount in excess of $500,000, up to $700,000. . . . . . . . .  $10,000 plus 4.0% of the excess over $500,000 On any amount in excess of $700,000, up to $900,000. . . . . . . . .  $18,000 plus 4.8% of the excess over $700,000 On any amount in excess of $900,000, up to $1,100,000. . . . . . . .  $27,600 plus 5.6% of the excess over $900,000 On any amount in excess of $1,100,000, up to $1,600,000. . . . $38,800 plus 6.4% of the excess over $1,100,000 On any amount in excess of $1,600,000, up to $2,100,000. . . . . $70,800 plus 7.2% of the excess over $1,600,000 On any amount in excess of $2,100,000, up to $2,600,000. . . . . $106,800 plus 8.0% of the excess over $2,100,000 On any amount in excess of $2,600,000, up to $3,100,000. . . . $146,800 plus 8.8% of the excess over $2,600,000 On any amount in excess of $3,100,000, up to $3,600,000. . . . . $190,800 plus 9.6% of the excess over $3,100,000 On any amount in excess of $3,600,000, up to $4,100,000. . . . . $238,800 plus 10.4% of the excess over $3,600,000 On any amount in excess of $4,100,000, up to $5,100,000. . . . . $290,800 plus 11.2% of the excess over $4,100,000 On any amount in excess of $5,100,000, up to $6,100,000 . . . . $402,800 plus 12.0% of the excess over $5,100,000 On any amount in excess of $6,100,000, up to $7,100,000 . . . . . $522,800 plus 12.8% of the excess over $6,100,000 On any amount in excess of $7,100,000, up to $8,100,000 . . . . . $650,800 plus 13.6% of the excess over $7,100,000 On any amount in excess of $8,100,000, up to $9,100,000 . . . . .  $786,800 plus 14.4% of the excess over $8,100,000 On any amount in excess of $9,100,000, up to $10,100,000 . . . . $930,800 plus 15.2% of the excess over $9,100,000 On any amount in excess of $10,100,000. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $1,082,800 plus 16.0% of the excess over $10,100,000 (b)   A credit shall be allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph equal to the amount of tax which would be determined by subparagraph (a) of this paragraph if the amount of the taxable estate were equal to the exclusion amount. For the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, the exclusion amount is $2,000,000. (c)   The amount of tax liability of a resident decedent determined pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of all estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, including inheritance taxes actually paid this State, in respect to any property owned by that decedent or subject to those taxes as a part of or in connection with the estate; provided however, that the amount of the reduction shall not exceed the proportion of the tax otherwise due under this subsection that the amount of the estate's property subject to tax by other jurisdictions bears to the entire estate taxable under this chapter. (4)   For the transfer of the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2018, there shall be no tax imposed. b.  (1)  In the case of the estate of a decedent dying before January 1, 2002 where no inheritance, succession or legacy tax is due this State under the provisions of chapters 33 to 36 of this title or under authority of any subsequent enactment imposing taxes of a similar nature, but an estate tax is due the United States under the provisions of any federal revenue act in effect as of the date of death, wherein provision is made for a credit on account of taxes paid the several states or territories of the United States, or the District of Columbia, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be the maximum amount of such credit less the aggregate amount of such estate, inheritance, succession or legacy taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia. (2)   In the case of the estate of a decedent dying after December 31, 2001, but before January 1, 2017, where no inheritance, succession or legacy tax is due this State under the provisions of chapters 33 to 36 of this title or under authority of any subsequent enactment imposing taxes of a similar nature, the tax imposed by this chapter shall be determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section. (3)   In the case of the estate of a decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017 the tax imposed by this chapter shall be determined pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection a. of this section. c.     For the purposes of this section, a "simplified tax system" to produce a liability similar to the liability determined pursuant to clause (i) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section is a tax system that is based upon the $675,000 unified estate and gift tax applicable exclusion amount in effect under the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2001, and results in general in the determination of a similar amount of tax but which will enable the person or corporation liable for the payment of the tax to calculate an amount of tax notwithstanding the lack or paucity of information for compliance due to such factors as the absence of an estate valuation made for federal estate tax purposes, the absence of a measure of the impact of gifts made during the lifetime of the decedent in the absence of federal gift tax information, and any other information compliance problems as the director determines are the result of the phased repeal of the federal estate tax. (cf: P.L.2016, c.57, s.7) 4.  Section 19 of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) is amended to read as follows: 19.  a.  The State Treasurer, and the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, together with a third public member who shall be jointly selected thereby, shall constitute the review council. b.    The review council shall, on or before January 15, 2020, provide the Governor and the Legislature with an advisory report of their consensus estimate of the increase or decrease in State revenues pursuant to each section of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.), and pursuant to this act as a whole, during the preceding three State fiscal years, including a comparison of those estimates to the legislative fiscal estimate or fiscal note published contemporaneous with the enactment of this act prepared pursuant to P.L.1980, c.67 (C.52:13B-6 et seq.). c.     The review council shall conduct an ongoing review of the application of each section of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.). The review council shall, not later than five days after any Legislative action that halts, delays, or reverses the implementation of those sections as scheduled on the date of enactment of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.), certify for the purposes of subparagraph (h) of paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1990, c.42 (C.54:15B-3) to the Director of the Division of Taxation that the scheduled implementation of P.L.2016, c.57 (C.54:15B-13 et al.) had been impeded. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to sections 1, 2, and 3 of P.L.    , c.   (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill. (cf:  P.L.2016, c.57, s.19) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately; provided however that sections 1 and 2 shall apply to highway fuel and fuel used on or after the first day of the first month next following the date of enactment and section 3 shall apply retroactively to the estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017. STATEMENT This bill provides an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax (PPGRT) and the motor fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of certain school buses clarifies the tax treatment of certain dyed fuel under the PPGRT, and clarifies the determination of taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of the estate tax.   The bill also excludes the exemptions and these clarifying changes from the review of legislative actions by the three-member review council established by P.L.2016, c.57, to prevent a cessation in the imposition of one of the components of the petroleum products gross receipts tax. Fuel Used for Certain School Buses.  The bill provides an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax and the motor fuel tax for fuel used for the operation of certain school buses.  Under the bill, the exemption applies to fuel used for school buses operated for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event by a religious or charitable organization or corporation or by a person under contract with a public or governmental agency or a religious or other charitable organization or corporation. To receive the benefit of the exemption, purchasers of fuel used to operate a school bus for the transportation of pupils to or from school or a school-sponsored activity or event must pay tax at the point of purchase and seek a refund of the taxes paid by the filing of a claim with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  As is required under current law for certain other exempt uses of fuel, the claim for refund must be filed with the director by the purchaser providing proof that the tax has been paid, and the director must confirm that a refunds has not been previously issued. The bill defines school buses by reference to the definition of school bus under R.S.39:1-1.  Under that section of law, a school bus is any motor vehicle operated by, or under contract with, a public or governmental agency, or religious or other charitable organization or corporation, or privately operated for the transportation of children to or from school for secular or religious education, which complies with the regulations of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission affecting school buses, and includes School Vehicle Type I and School Vehicle Type II. Under current law, consumers of fuel that are eligible for an exemption from the petroleum products gross receipts tax and the motor fuel tax must pay the tax at the point of purchase and seek a refund of the taxes paid by the filing of a claim with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The law provides that the claim for refund must be filed by the consumer providing proof that the tax has been paid and a refund has not been previously issued. Treatment of Dyed Fuel under PPGRT.  The bill clarifies the tax treatment of certain dyed fuel under the petroleum products gross receipts tax.  Under the bill, dyed fuel is excluded from the definition of gross receipts so that receipts from sales of dyed fuel (unless used in a motor vehicle for operation on the public highways) are explicitly exempt from tax and recognized in a similar form and manner as dyed fuel is recognized for purposes of the motor fuel tax. Under the motor fuel tax, dyed fuel is dyed diesel fuel or dyed kerosene that is required to be dyed pursuant to United States Environmental Protection Agency rules or is dyed pursuant Internal Revenue Service rules or any other requirements set by those federal agencies.  Fuel is dyed to easily identify fuel that has not been subjected to federal highway tax.  The motor fuel tax recognizes that dyed fuel can generally only be used for an exempt public purpose, and prohibits dyed fuel sold for an exempt purpose from being used in a taxable manner through the imposition of certain fines and penalties. Determination of Taxable Estates of Resident Decedents.  The bill clarifies the determination of taxable estates of certain resident decedents for purposes of the estate tax. Under the bill, the taxable estate of each resident decedent dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, is to be determined based upon the taxable estate of the decedent for federal estate tax purposes but without the deduction of any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia as is otherwise allowed pursuant to section 2058 of the federal Internal Revenue Code in effect on January 1, 2017. The disallowance of the deduction will limit the potential of a tax benefit that estates of resident decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017, but before January 1, 2018, might claim for any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or (territory of the United States or District of Columbia). Currently, the law directs the estate tax to be determined based upon the federal taxable estate (which is the decedents gross estate minus certain deductions, including the deduction for estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession taxes actually paid to any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia), and provides that the resident decedents tax liability is to further be reduced by a credit for a proportion of those same taxes actually paid to any state in respect to property in another state owned by the decedent or subject to those taxes as part of or in connection with the estate. Exclusion from Review by the Review Council.  The bill excludes the exemptions and the clarifying changes from the review of the three member review council established by P.L.2016, c.57 to prevent a cessation in the imposition of one of the components of the PPGRT.  Under the bill, the provisions of current law that direct the three-member review council to review legislative actions and issue certifications to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the scheduled implementation of P.L.2016, c.57 might otherwise be impeded will not apply to those sections of the bill that exempt fuel used for certain school buses and clarify treatment of dyed fuel and the determination of taxable estates of resident decedents. Under current law, the three member review council (i.e. the State Treasurer, Legislative Budget and Finance Officer, and a third public member) is directed to monitor the actions of the Legislature on an ongoing basis for interference with the implementation of P.L.2016, c.57.  If the implementation is impeded, the council is to certify this interference to the Director of the Division of Taxation and the director is to effectuate the cessation of the imposition of one of the components of the PPGRT. Effective Date.  The bill is scheduled to take effect immediately upon enactment, but provides for the exemption and clarification to the treatment of dyed fuel to apply to the fuel used on or after the first day of the first month next following enactment.  The bill provides for the clarification of the determination of taxable estates to apply retroactively to estates of resident decedents dying on or after January 1, 2017.
