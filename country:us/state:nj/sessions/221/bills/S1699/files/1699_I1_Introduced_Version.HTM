amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that psychoactive hemp-derived cannabinoid
products, such as foods, supplements, cosmetics, and inhalables, can contain
more psychoactive cannabinoid than is lawfully permitted to be sold in
unregulated form, and yet such products are being sold in New Jersey, in
increasing amounts outside the regulatory structure in place for cannabis and
hemp.  Delta-8-THC, a hemp-derived substance that is legal in New Jersey, is an
extract of hemp that has psychoactive properties lower than the federal limit of
0.3 percent Delta-9 THC, and, as such, currently is legal.  However, products
containing Delta-8-THC are being marketed without adequate notice of content.
The THC content in Delta-8-THC products has been found, in independent testing,
to be as high as the THC in cannabis products, and these products contain
previously unknown isomers and cannabinoids.  Registration, testing, labeling,
and other regulatory requirements for hemp-derived cannabinoid products through
the New Jersey regulatory structure are necessary to ensure the safety of
products sold to the public.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Cannabis Regulatory
Commission (the commission) is uniquely positioned to track, through a
registration process, hemp-derived cannabinoid product manufactured outside the
New Jersey regulatory structure, and establish other safety and testing
requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  As used
in this act, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Artificially derived
cannabinoid means a chemical substance that is created by a chemical reaction
that changes the molecular structure of any chemical substance derived from the
plant Cannabis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Cannabidiol (CBD) means a
nonpsychoactive cannabinoid found in the cannabis sativa plant.  CBD has  the
formula C21H30O2 and chemical structure, inclusive of stereochemical
variations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Cannabidiolic acid (CBDA)
means the cannabinoid having the formula C22H30O4 and chemical structure,
inclusive of stereochemical variations.  It is the precursor to cannabidiol
(CBD).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Cannabinoids means
compounds structurally defined as a diverse class of C21 or C22 terpenophenolic
compounds found in Cannabis sativa L., their carboxylic acids, analogs, and
transformation products. The term is also used in the scientific literature to represent
structurally unrelated cannabimimetic compounds. The main cannabinoids found in
cannabis plants are Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannabidiol (CBD).  In
addition to THC and CBD, there are more than 100 cannabinoids that could be
identified.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Cannabis means the
Cannabis sativa plant, referred to as cannabis, an umbrella term that includes
marijuana and hemp depending on its THC concentration level.  Cannabis is a
genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which Cannabis sativa is
a species, and Cannabis indica and Cannabis ruderalis are subspecies thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Cannabimimetic means a compound
that is not structurally a cannabinoid, but which can elicit a biological
response similar to those produced by cannabinoids by acting directly or
indirectly on cannabinoid receptors in the body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Contamination means
microbiological, chemical, radiological, or physical substances that either
develop in or are added (purposefully or unknowingly) to consumable hemp
products or ingredients and are unsafe for human consumption or in violation of
a regulatory standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;CBD&quot; means
cannabidiol, a cannabinoid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol
(Delta-8-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis
sativa plant, but does not occur in naturally significant amounts.  It has the
chemical formula C21H30O2 and the chemical structure inclusive of
stereochemical variations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(Delta-9-THC) means a psychoactive cannabinoid compound found in the Cannabis
sativa plant, and the primary psychoactive compound found in marijuana. 
Delta-9-THC is referred to as THC.  THC has the formula C21H30O2 and the
chemical structure inclusive of stereochemical variations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Dry weight basis
refers to a method of determining the percentage of a chemical in a substance
after removing the moisture from the substance. The ratio of the amount of
moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     </b>Decarboxylation means
a process of treating a cannabis material or product to remove carboxyl groups
from the cannabinoids native in the plant, to form transformation products such
as THC and CBD.  Decarboxylation is commonly accomplished by application of
heat.  Decarboxylation is not considered a synthetic process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Hemp means the plant
Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and
all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of
isomers, whether growing or not, with Delta-9. tetrahydrocannabinol
concentrations of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Hemp-derived
cannabinoid&quot; means:  a cannabinoid or an isomer created from such
cannabinoid, that is derived from hemp in a concentration of more than
one-tenth of one percent (0.1%); or a hemp-derived product containing delta-9
tetrahydrocannabinol in a concentration of three-tenths of one percent (0.3%)
or less on a dry weight basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pursuant to P.L.2019, c.238,
known as the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture is designated as the primary regulatory authority over the
production of hemp in the State.  The department is responsible for
promulgating regulation plans under which the State monitors and regulates hemp
production, an agricultural crop which the State actively promotes, and which
permits farmers and businesses to cultivate, handle and process hemp, and to
sell hemp products for commercial purposes (and which is excluded from the definition
of a controlled substance due to the presence of hemp or hemp-derived
cannabinoids).  Hemp-derived products manufactured outside the regulatory
structure, while not illegal in New Jersey, remain unregulated, although
chemical conversion processes can make hemp derived cannabinoid products, such
as Delta 8, have psychoactive properties similar to the THC in legalized
cannabis, and contain unknown but harmful byproducts of the conversion process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Cannabis Regulatory Commission as the regulatory body for hemp-derived
cannabinoids for purposes of registration and sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid
products.  The bill further provides for existing laboratories to test
hemp-derived cannabinoid products.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 1. This section contains
legislative findings and declarations including the following:  hemp-derived
cannabinoid products can contain more psychoactive cannabis than is lawfully
permitted to be sold in unregulated form, and yet, such products are being sold
in New Jersey outside the regulatory structure for cannabis and hemp.  The
Cannabis Regulatory Commission is uniquely positioned to implement a regulatory
structure, including, tracking through establishing a registration requirement
for hemp-derived cannabinoid products manufactured outside the New Jersey
regulatory structure, and other health, safety and testing requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 2.  This section
defines key terms which aid in distinguishing cannabinoid products with
psychoactive properties from those with non-psychoactive properties.  A key
term, cannabinoid means the naturally occurring chemical compound found in
cannabis.  The main cannabinoids found in cannabis plants are
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which, in simplified terms, is psychoactive, and
cannabidiol (CBD) which is non-psychoactive.  Through a conversion process, known
as isomerization, legal CBD products, such as Delta-8, have been found to
contain psychoactive properties, and potentially harmful byproduct from the
conversion process.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Since many products are sold
in convenience stores and gas stations, the bill targets retail merchants,
defined in the bill as hemp-derived cannabinoid retailers, to register
products sold through their locations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3.  This section
amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-34, concerned with commission activities associated with
the personal use of cannabis, to grant powers which enable the commission to
perform duties prescribed in the bill.  Jurisdiction, supervision, duties,
functions, and powers are extended to hemp-derived cannabinoid products
manufactured outside the New Jersey regulatory structure.  The commission is
empowered to regulate the purchase, sale, transportation, and delivery of
hemp-derived cannabinoid products in accordance with the provision of this
bill, and to adopt, amend, or repeal regulations as necessary.  Subsection d.
of this section adds the Commissioner of Agriculture as a consultant agency for
the adoption of regulations by the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4.  This section
establishes specific areas for regulation of hemp-derived cannabinoid products,
including registration requirements, permit requirements for hemp-derived
cannabinoid retailers, security requirements, age requirements to prevent the
sale of hemp-derived cannabinoid products with detectable THC to persons under
21 years of age, labeling and packaging requirements, unannounced visits,<i> </i>and
civil penalties for failure to comply with regulations adopted pursuant to the
provisions of the bill<i>.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5.  This section
amends N.J.S.A. 24:6I-17, concerned with the testing of cannabis, to require
that samples of cannabinoid product manufactured outside the New Jersey
regulatory structure be tested by a laboratory licensed pursuant to
N.J.S.A.24:6I-18 (testing laboratories) or pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35
(cannabis testing laboratories).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6.  This section
authorizes the testing of hemp-derived cannabinoid products at testing
laboratories currently licensed to test medical cannabis and medical cannabis
products, usable cannabis, cannabis products, cannabis extracts, and other
cannabis resins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 7.  This section
provides that a retail establishment that offers for sale hemp-derived
cannabinoid products prior to the passage of this bill  shall have a period of
one year from passage to comply with the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is not the intention of the
sponsor to ban hemp-derived cannabinoids, such as Delta-8, but to require
registration of such products, and to impose health and safety requirements
through a regulatory structure. </p>
