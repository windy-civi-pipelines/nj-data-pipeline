<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning greenhouse gas emissions and supplementing
Title 26 of the Revised Statues.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the &quot;Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds and
declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a. New Jersey has demonstrated
leadership in the battle against climate change and the climate actions of the State
have inspired and contributed to bold actions in other states and across the
globe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  New Jerseyans are already
facing devastating wildfires, sea level rise, excessive rainfall, and other
impacts associated with climate change that threaten the health and safety of New
Jerseyans, undermines the sustainability of our communities, particularly those
communities most affected by the negative effects of climate change, and the
economic well-being of the State and its residents, including threatening many
of the State's largest industries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Climate change also poses
a significant risk to companies' long-term economic success and disrupts the
value chains on which they rely.  Managing these risks requires investments in
decarbonization strategies that lead to emissions reductions and provide
economic benefits for New Jerseyans and the State economy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  New Jersey has doubled its
real gross domestic product growth rate since 2018, is on track to be the 31st
largest economy in the world, and is a highly desirable market for the globe's
most profitable companies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  New Jersey investors,
consumers, and other stakeholders deserve transparency from companies regarding
their greenhouse gas emissions to inform their decision-making.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  United States companies
that have access to New Jersey's tremendously valuable consumer market by
virtue of exercising their corporate franchise in the State also share
responsibility for disclosing their contributions to global greenhouse gas
emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  Companies can increase the
State's climate risk through emissions activities that include, but are not
limited to, company operations, supply chain activities, employee and consumer
transportation, goods production and movement, construction, land use, and
natural resource extraction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  Accurate and comprehensive
data that is subject to an assurance engagement by an independent third-party assurance
provider is required to determine a company's direct and indirect greenhouse
gas emissions, also known as its carbon footprint, and to effectively identify
the sources of the emissions and develop means to reduce the emissions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  The current approach for the
disclosure of climate emissions from public and private corporate enterprises
relies largely on voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas inventories, goals,
commitments, and agreements, and lacks the full transparency and consistency
needed by residents and financial markets to fully understand these climate
risks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  The people, communities,
and other stakeholders in New Jersey, facing the existential threat of climate
change, have a right to know about the sources of carbon pollution, as measured
by the comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions data of those companies
benefiting from doing business in the State, in order to make informed decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  The Greenhouse Gas
Protocol is the globally recognized greenhouse gas emissions accounting and
reporting standard developed and updated by the World Resources Institute and
the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and provides the
framework for corporate greenhouse gas emissions accounting and reporting.  The
framework defines and categorizes emissions as scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions.
Many companies already partially or fully disclose their emissions data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  Mandating annual, full-scope
greenhouse gas emissions data reporting to the emissions reporting organization
for all United States companies with total annual revenues in excess of $1
billion that do business in New Jersey, as well as ensuring public access to
the data in a manner that is easily understandable and accessible, will inform
investors, empower consumers, and activate companies to improve risk management
in order to move towards a net-zero carbon economy and is a critical next step
that New Jersey must take to protect the State and its residents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Assurance
engagement&quot; means a report, produced by an assurance provider, which
certifies the accuracy of a greenhouse gas emissions report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Assurance provider&quot;
means an environmental consultant or other entity with expertise and experience
in measuring and verifying scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions of reporting
entities or other, similar organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Emissions reporting
organization&quot; means a nonprofit emissions reporting organization
contracted by the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to section 6
of this act that currently operates a greenhouse gas emission reporting
organization for organizations operating in the United States, and has
experience with greenhouse gas emissions disclosure by entities operating in New
Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Limited assurance level&quot;
means the degree of verification of greenhouse gas emissions data that may
reasonably be obtained by an assurance provider using exclusively data that is
provided by the reporting entity.</p>

penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day's
continuance of the violation constitutes a separate and distinct violation.  Any
civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs
