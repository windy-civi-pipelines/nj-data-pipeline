"Compliance entity" means an owner or operator of an electric generating unit, with a nameplate capacity equal to or greater than 25 megawatts of electrical output, in New Jersey that is required to obtain allowances in order to operate an electric generating unit that holds an operating permit from the department issued pursuant to P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.), whether that unit is in operation or in development.  "Compliance entity" shall not include any cogeneration facility or combined heat and power facility that is an "on-site generation facility" as that term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51) and sells less than 10 percent of its annual gross electrical generation. "Consumer benefit" means any action or measure to:  promote energy efficiency; directly mitigate electricity ratepayer impacts; develop and deliver renewable or non-carbon-emitting energy technologies; stimulate or reward investment in the development of innovative carbon emissions abatement technologies with significant carbon emissions reduction potential; fund programs that promote measurable electricity end-use energy efficiency in the commercial, institutional, and industrial sectors; or fund the administration of greenhouse gas emissions allowance trading and consumer benefit programs. "Department" means the Department of Environmental Protection. "Dispatch agreement facility" means a facility that is a compliance entity that is a cogeneration facility or has a heat rate below 8,100 BTU per kilowatt-hour, and has entered into a power agreement:  (1) with a duration of more than 15 years from its effective date; (2) that provides that the entity's counterpart to the agreement controls the electric dispatch of the facility; (3) which was executed prior to January 1, 2002; and (4) which does not allow for the entity to pass the cost of allowances on to the counterpart to the agreement.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.362, s.12) 3.  (New section)  a.  No later than 18 months after the effective date of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board shall adopt, pursuant to the  "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations concerning the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors in the State. b.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall provide that, in acting on a petition by an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider for the construction, purchase, or lease of a small modular nuclear reactor, the board shall consider the following: (1)  whether, and to what extent, the small modular nuclear reactor proposed by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider will replace a loss of generating capacity in the State resulting from the retirement or planned retirement of one or more existing electric generating facilities, which are located in New Jersey and which use coal or natural gas a fuel source; and (2)  whether the small modular nuclear reactor that will replace an existing facility will be located on the same site as, or near, the existing facility and, if so, potential opportunities for the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to make use of any land and existing infrastructure or facilities already owned or under the control of the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, or create new employment opportunities for workers who have been, or would be, displaced as a result of the retirement of the existing facility. c.  The board shall not authorize the operation of a small modular nuclear reactor unless the owner or operator of the proposed small modular nuclear reactor provides evidence of a plan to apply for all licenses or permits to construct or operate the proposed small modular nuclear reactor as may be required by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection, and any other relevant state or federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the construction or operation of nuclear generating facilities. d.  Any reports; notices of violations; or other notifications sent to or from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by or to the owner or operator of a proposed small modular nuclear reactor shall be submitted by the owner or operator to the commission within such times as prescribed by the board, subject to the board's duty to treat as confidential and protect from public access and disclosure any information that is contained in a report or notice and that is considered confidential or exempt from public access and disclosure under State or federal law. e.  A person that owns or operates a small modular nuclear reactor in the State may not store spent nuclear fuel or high level radioactive waste from the small modular nuclear reactor on the site of the small modular nuclear reactor without first meeting all applicable requirements of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. f.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would direct the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to adopt rules and regulations concerning the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors in the State.  The bill would also authorize the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) to incentivize the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors using moneys in the "Global Warming Solutions Fund" established pursuant to P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.). As defined by the bill, "small modular nuclear reactor" means a nuclear fission reactor that: (1) has a rated electric generating capacity of not more than 300 megawatts; (2) is capable of being construction and operated either alone or in combination with one or more similar reactors if additional reactors are or become necessary at a single site; and (3) is required to be licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The bill would require the BPU, whenever it considers a petition by an electric power supplier or basic generation service provider for the construction, purchase, or lease of a small modular nuclear reactor, to consider: (1)  whether, and to what extent, the small modular nuclear reactor proposed by the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider will replace a loss of generating capacity in the State, resulting from the retirement or planned retirement of one or more existing electric generating facilities, which are located in New Jersey and which use coal or natural gas a fuel source; and (2)  whether the small modular nuclear reactor that will replace an existing facility will be located on the same site as, or near, the existing facility and, if so, potential opportunities for the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to make use of any land and existing infrastructure or facilities already owned or under the control of the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider, or create new employment opportunities for workers who have been, or would be, displaced as a result of the retirement of the existing facility. The bill would also establish other requirements for the operation of small modular nuclear reactors, as enumerated in subsections c. through e. of section 3 of the bill, including a requirement that a person that owns or operates a small modular nuclear reactor in the State may not store spent nuclear fuel or high level radioactive waste from the small modular nuclear reactor on the site of the small modular nuclear reactor without first meeting all applicable requirements of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
