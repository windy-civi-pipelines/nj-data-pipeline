shall consider the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  whether, and to what
extent, the small modular nuclear reactor proposed by the electric power
supplier or basic generation service provider will replace a loss of generating
capacity in the State resulting from the retirement or planned retirement of
one or more existing electric generating facilities, which are located in New
Jersey and which use coal or natural gas a fuel source; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  whether the small modular
nuclear reactor that will replace an existing facility will be located on the
same site as, or near, the existing facility and, if so, potential opportunities
for the electric power supplier or basic generation service provider to make
use of any land and existing infrastructure or facilities already owned or
under the control of the electric power supplier or basic generation service
provider, or create new employment opportunities for workers who have been, or
would be, displaced as a result of the retirement of the existing facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The board shall not
authorize the operation of a small modular nuclear reactor unless the owner or
operator of the proposed small modular nuclear reactor provides evidence of a
plan to apply for all licenses or permits to construct or operate the proposed
small modular nuclear reactor as may be required by the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, the Department of Environmental Protection, and any
other relevant state or federal regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the
construction or operation of nuclear generating facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Any reports; notices of
violations; or other notifications sent to or from the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission by or to the owner or operator of a proposed small
modular nuclear reactor shall be submitted by the owner or operator to the
commission within such times as prescribed by the board, subject to the board's
duty to treat as confidential and protect from public access and disclosure any
information that is contained in a report or notice and that is considered
confidential or exempt from public access and disclosure under State or federal
law.</p>

reactor on the site of the small modular nuclear reactor without first meeting
all applicable requirements of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would direct the
Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to adopt rules and regulations concerning the
construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors in the State.  The
bill would also authorize the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA)
to incentivize the construction and operation of small modular nuclear reactors
using moneys in the &quot;Global Warming Solutions Fund&quot; established
pursuant to P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined by the bill,
&quot;small modular nuclear reactor&quot; means a nuclear fission reactor that:
(1) has a rated electric generating capacity of not more than 300 megawatts;
(2) is capable of being construction and operated either alone or in
combination with one or more similar reactors if additional reactors are or
become necessary at a single site; and (3) is required to be licensed by the
United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
BPU, whenever it considers a petition by an electric power supplier or basic
generation service provider for the construction, purchase, or lease of a small
modular nuclear reactor, to consider:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  whether, and to what
extent, the small modular nuclear reactor proposed by the electric power
supplier or basic generation service provider will replace a loss of generating
capacity in the State, resulting from the retirement or planned retirement of
one or more existing electric generating facilities, which are located in New

opportunities for the electric power supplier or basic generation service
provider to make use of any land and existing infrastructure or facilities
already owned or under the control of the electric power supplier or basic
generation service provider, or create new employment opportunities for workers
who have been, or would be, displaced as a result of the retirement of the
existing facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also establish
other requirements for the operation of small modular nuclear reactors, as
enumerated in subsections c. through e. of section 3 of the bill, including a
requirement that a person that owns or operates a small modular nuclear reactor
in the State may not store spent nuclear fuel or high level radioactive waste
from the small modular nuclear reactor on the site of the small modular nuclear
reactor without first meeting all applicable requirements of the United States
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>
