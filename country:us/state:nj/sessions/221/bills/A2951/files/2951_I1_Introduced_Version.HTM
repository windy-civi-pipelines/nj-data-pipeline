the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.   R.S.39:3-10
is amended to read as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      39:3-10.
A person shall not drive a motor vehicle on a public highway in this State
unless the person is under supervision while participating in a
behind-the-wheel driving course pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1977, c.25 (C.39:3-13.2a)
or is in possession of a validated permit, or a probationary or basic driver's
license issued to that person in accordance with this article.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      A
person under 18 years of age shall not be issued a basic license to drive motor
vehicles, and a person shall not be issued a validated permit, including a
validated examination permit, until the applicant has passed a satisfactory
examination and other requirements as to the applicant's ability as an
operator.  The examination shall include: a test of the applicant's vision; the
applicant's ability to understand traffic control devices; the applicant's
knowledge of safe driving practices, including the dangers of driving a vehicle
in an aggressive manner, which shall include, but not be limited to, unexpectedly
altering the speed of a vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane
changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of
way, and following another vehicle too closely; the applicant's knowledge of
operating a motor vehicle in a manner that safely shares the roadway with
pedestrians, cyclists, skaters, riders of motorized-scooters, and other
non-motorized vehicles, which shall include, but not be limited to, passing a
cyclist on the roadway, recognizing bicycle lanes, navigating intersections
with pedestrians and cyclists, and exiting a vehicle without endangering
pedestrians and cyclists; the applicant's knowledge of the effects that
ingestion of alcohol or drugs has on a person's ability to operate a motor
vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning
from motor vehicles and techniques for the safe operation and proper
maintenance of a motor vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of portions of the
mechanism of motor vehicles as is necessary to insure the safe operation of a
vehicle of the kind or kinds indicated by the applicant; and the applicant's
knowledge of the laws and ordinary usages of the road.  The examination shall
be made available in English and each of the three languages, other than
English, most commonly spoken in the State, as determined by the chief
administrator.  The chief administrator shall periodically, and at least every
five years, verify the three languages, other than English, most commonly
spoken in the State.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      <u>The
commission shall provide all reasonable accommodation to a person with a
disability taking the examination to ensure that the results of the examination
accurately reflect the persons knowledge of the subject matter being tested.</u></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      A
person shall not sit for an examination for any permit without exhibiting photo
identification deemed acceptable by the commission, unless that person is a
high school student participating in a course of automobile driving education
approved by the State Department of Education and conducted in a public,
parochial, or private school of this State, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950,
c.127 (C.39:3-13.1). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      Prior
to taking an examination for any permit, a person shall watch a video created
by the commission, in conjunction with the Attorney General, explaining the
rights and responsibilities of a driver stopped by a law enforcement officer. 
The video shall be used for informational purposes only and shall not be used
in any criminal proceeding involving a driver stopped by a law enforcement
officer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      The
commission may waive the written law knowledge examination for any person 18
years of age or older possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other
state, the District of Columbia, or the United States Territories of American
Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The
commission shall be required to provide that person with a booklet that
highlights those motor vehicle laws unique to New Jersey.  A road test shall be
required for a probationary license and serve as a demonstration of the
applicant's ability to operate a vehicle of the class designated.  During the
road test, an applicant may use a rear visibility system, parking sensors, or
other technology installed on the motor vehicle that enables the applicant to
view areas directly behind the vehicle or alerts the applicant of obstacles
while parking. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      A
person shall not sit for a road test unless that person exhibits photo
identification deemed acceptable by the commission.  A high school student who
has completed a course of behind-the-wheel automobile driving education
approved by the State Department of Education and conducted in a public,
parochial, or private school of this State, who has been issued a special
learner's permit pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127 (C.39:3-13.1) prior
to January 1, 2003, shall not be required to exhibit photo identification in
order to sit for a road test.  The commission may waive the road test for any
person 18 years of age or older possessing a valid driver's license issued by
any other state, the District of Columbia, or the United States Territories of
American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin
Islands.  The road test shall be given on public streets, where practicable and
feasible, but may be preceded by an off-street screening process to assess
basic skills.  The commission shall approve locations for the road test which
pose no more than a minimal risk of injury to the applicant, the examiner, and
other motorists.  New locations for the road test shall not be approved unless
the test can be given on public streets.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      A
person who successfully completes a road test for a motorcycle license or a
motorcycle endorsement when operating a motorcycle or motorized scooter with an
engine displacement of less than 231 cubic centimeters shall be issued a
motorcycle license or endorsement restricting the person's operation of the
vehicles to any motorcycle with an engine displacement of 500 cubic centimeters
or less.  A person who successfully completes a road test for a motorcycle
license or motorcycle endorsement when operating a motorcycle with an engine
displacement of 231 or more cubic centimeters shall be issued a motorcycle
license or endorsement without any restriction as to engine displacement.  Any
person who successfully completes an approved motorcycle safety education
course established pursuant to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1991, c.452
(C.27:5F-36) shall be issued a motorcycle license or endorsement without
