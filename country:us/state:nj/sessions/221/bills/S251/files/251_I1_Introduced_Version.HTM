after the effective date of this act, each producer of propulsion batteries
sold within the State, either individually or as a part of a group of
producers, shall, in consultation with the department, develop and submit a
battery management plan to the department for review and approval pursuant to
section 6 of this act.  The plan shall provide for producers to be responsible
for the collection and management of the producers used propulsion batteries
that are offered to the producer for take-back by the current battery owner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  A producer shall be deemed
responsible for the end-of-life management of a propulsion battery pursuant to
this act as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) for a propulsion battery
embedded in a vehicle that is sold in the State, or sold or distributed in or
into the State via remote sale or distribution: </p>

a battery that a secondary producer has remanufactured or repurposed, unless:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the secondary producer is
in a contractual relationship with the original producer, which provides for
the retention of responsibility for the end-of-life management of the battery
by the primary producer; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the contract has been
provided to the department as part of a battery management plan or through
another means approved by the department. </p>

utilized to transport used propulsion batteries to authorized recycling
facilities, including the name and location of all authorized recyclers to be
directly utilized pursuant to the plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) processes and methods that
will be utilized to remanufacture, repurpose, or recycle propulsion batteries
that have reached the end of their service life, including, if necessary, a
plan for final disposal of such batteries, in accordance with environmentally
sound management practices; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) a strategy for informing
consumers, vehicle repair facilities, and vehicle dismantlers in the State
about the requirement to properly manage propulsion batteries, the environmental

the mechanisms for the management of propulsion batteries that are available
pursuant to the plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) the means that will be

management of used propulsion batteries, the costs of such financing shall be
borne by the producer of that propulsion battery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  Any entity that becomes a
producer after the effective date of this act shall receive approval from the
department of its battery management plan prior to manufacturing, selling,

the battery management plan, the producer shall implement the plan within 90
days after receipt of approval from the department or as otherwise agreed to by
the department.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  If the department approves

the battery is collected from a location or using a mechanism designated by the
producer in its battery management plan. The producer shall provide for the
proper reuse, remanufacturing, repurposing, or recycling of a propulsion
battery returned pursuant to this subsection. The provisions of this subsection
shall not apply to the original producer of a propulsion battery that has been

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish a framework
for the proper end-of-life management of propulsion batteries, and would be
known as the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Battery Act.  The bill defines
propulsion battery to mean an electrical energy storage device, consisting of
one or more individual battery modules or battery cells, which are used to
supply power to propel an electric or hybrid road vehicle.  The term includes,
but is not limited to, lithium-ion batteries and nickel-metal hydride
batteries.  &quot;Propulsion battery&quot; does not include a starter battery
or a battery used for, or embedded in, products for industrial applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require any
propulsion battery sold in the State to contain a permanent label that provides
information about the battery.  Under current law, P.L.2003 c.266 (C.26:2C-8.15
et seq.), New Jersey participates in California's Low Emission Vehicle Program,
and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) adopts rules regarding low
emissions vehicles that are functionally equivalent to California's. 
California recently adopted rules regarding vehicle battery labeling, at
section 1962.6 of Title 13 of the California Code of Regulations.  This bill
would clarify that the same requirements regarding propulsion battery labeling
would apply in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would explicitly
prohibit persons from disposing of propulsion batteries, and their
subcomponents, as solid waste.  The bill would also authorize solid waste
collectors to refuse to collect a solid waste container containing a propulsion
battery or component, and it would authorize solid waste disposal facilities to
refuse to accept propulsion batteries or truckloads and roll-off containers
containing an propulsion battery or component.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No later than 180 days after
the effective date of the bill, each producer of propulsion batteries would be
required to develop and submit a battery management plan to the DEP for review
and approval.  Under the bill, &quot;producer&quot; is defined to mean a
propulsion battery manufacturer, remanufacturer, or importer, a person who
repurposes propulsion batteries, or a propulsion manufacturer, brand or
trademark licensee, or importer, who manufactures, sells, offers for sale, or
imports a propulsion battery in or into New Jersey.  Subsection b. of section 5
of the bill would establish provisions regarding which producer is to assume
responsibility for a given propulsion battery.  Subsection d. of section 5 of
the bill would establish certain minimum requirements for the contents of a
battery management plan, including the methods that will be used to collect and
store the used propulsion batteries that are returned to the producer.  The
bill would also establish provisions regarding the DEP's process for reviewing
and approving battery management plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a consumer in
possession of an unwanted propulsion battery would be authorized to return the
battery (or the vehicle containing the battery) to a location designated by the
producer of the battery, as specified in the producer's battery management
plan, or to any Class D recycling center that is authorized by the DEP to
recycle electric batteries.  The bill would require the producer to accept the
battery and to provide for its proper reuse, remanufacturing, repurposing, or
recycling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
propulsion battery producers to provide consumers with educational materials
related to the producer's approved battery management plan and the collection
services that are available, including information identifying the end-of-life
management options that are available for propulsion batteries through the
battery management plan, and a notice that, in New Jersey, the costs of the
services will be covered by the producer.  The bill would also require the DEP
to establish a means of addressing consumer complaints and a public education
program to assure the widespread dissemination of information concerning the
bill's provisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would give the DEP
authority to enter, at any time during normal business hours and upon
presentation of appropriate credentials, a recycling center, vehicle recycler,
or propulsion battery producer in order to determine compliance with the bill's
provisions.  Finally, the bill would provide that a violation of the bill's
provisions would be considered a violation of the &quot;Solid Waste Management
Act,&quot; P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.).  A person who violates the
&quot;Solid Waste Management Act&quot; may be assessed a civil administrative
penalty of up to $50,000 for each violation.</p>
