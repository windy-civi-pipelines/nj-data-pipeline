(7)  The superintendent may charge a reasonable application fee to retired officers to offset any costs associated with administering the application process set forth in this subsection. m.   Nothing in subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using any device that projects, releases or emits any substance specified as being non-injurious to wildlife by the Director of the Division of Animal Health in the Department of Agriculture, and which may immobilize wildlife and produces only temporary physical discomfort through being vaporized or otherwise dispensed in the air for the purpose of repelling bear or other animal attacks or for the aversive conditioning of wildlife. n.    Nothing in subsection b., c., d. or e. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using hand held pistol-like devices, rifles or shotguns that launch pyrotechnic missiles for the sole purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife; from possessing, transporting or using rifles, pistols or similar devices for the sole purpose of chemically immobilizing wild or non-domestic animals; or, provided the duly authorized person complies with the requirements of subsection j. of this section, from possessing, transporting or using rifles or shotguns, upon completion of a Police Training Commission approved training course, in order to dispatch injured or dangerous animals or for non-lethal use for the purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife. (cf: P.L.2013, c.219, s.1) 5.    N.J.S.2C:52-32 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-32.   This chapter shall be construed with the primary objective of providing relief to the reformed offender who has led a life of rectitude and disassociated himself with unlawful activity, but not to create a system whereby persistent violators of the law or those who associate themselves with continuing criminal activity have a regular means of expunging their police and criminal records.        This chapter shall not be construed to limit the expungement of criminal records of a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer acting in the course of official duties. Unless a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer is convicted of a criminal offense for an action that occurred while in the performance of his law enforcement duties, all criminal records and reports relating to the arrest and subsequent investigation of that officer pertaining to that action shall be automatically expunged. (cf: P.L.2015, c.261, s.9) 6.    Section 3 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.10) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  Any local unit may, as it deems necessary, appoint special law enforcement officers sufficient to perform the duties and responsibilities permitted by local ordinances authorized by N.J.S. 40A:14-118 or ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, authorized by N.J.S.40A:14-106 and within the conditions and limitations as may be established pursuant to this act. b.    No person may be appointed as a special law enforcement officer unless the person: (1)  [Is] is a resident of this State during the term of appointment; (2)  [Is] is able to read, write and speak the English language well and intelligently and has a high school diploma or its equivalent; (3)  [Is] is sound in body and of good health; (4)  [Is] is of good moral character; (5)  [Has] has not been convicted of any offense involving dishonesty or which would make him unfit to perform the duties of his office; (6)  [Has] has successfully undergone the same psychological testing that is required of all full-time police officers in the municipality or county or, with regard to a special law enforcement officer hired for a seasonal period by a resort municipality which requires psychological testing of its full-time police officers, has successfully undergone a program of psychological testing approved by the commission; (7)  at the time of appointment, undergoes drug testing for controlled dangerous substances or controlled dangerous substance analogs; and (8)  is between 21 and 75 years of age. c.    Every applicant for the position of special law enforcement officer appointed pursuant to this act shall have fingerprints taken, which fingerprints shall be filed with the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. d.    [No] A person shall not be appointed to serve as a special law enforcement officer in more than one local unit at the same time, [nor shall] and any permanent, regularly appointed full-time police officer of any local unit shall not be appointed as a special law enforcement officer in any local unit.  [No] A public official with responsibility for setting law enforcement policy or exercising authority over the budget of the local unit or supervision of the police department of a local unit shall not be appointed as a special law enforcement officer. e.    Before any special law enforcement officer is appointed pursuant to this act, the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit shall ascertain the eligibility and qualifications of the applicant and report these determinations in writing to the appointing authority. f.     Any person who at any time prior to his appointment had served as a duly qualified, fully-trained, full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer in any municipality or county of this State and who was separated from that prior service in good standing, shall be eligible to serve as a special law enforcement officer consistent with guidelines promulgated by the commission. The training requirements set forth in section 4 of this act [may] shall be waived by the commission with regard to any person eligible to be appointed as a special law enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.3) 7.    Section 4 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.11) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  No person may commence his duties as a special law enforcement officer unless he has successfully completed a training course approved by the commission and no special law enforcement officer may be issued a firearm unless he has successfully completed the basic firearms course approved by the commission for permanent, regularly appointed police and annual requalification examinations as required by subsection b. of section 7 of this act.  There shall be two classifications for special police officers.  The commission shall prescribe by rule or regulation the training standards to be established for each classification.  Training may be in a commission approved academy or in any other training program which the commission may determine appropriate.  The classifications shall be based upon the duties to be performed by the special law enforcement officer as follows: (1)  Class One.  Officers of this class shall be authorized to perform routine traffic detail, spectator control and similar duties. If authorized by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, Class One officers shall have the power to issue summonses for disorderly persons and petty disorderly persons offenses, violations of municipal ordinances and violations of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.4) 8.    Section 7 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.14) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.   Special law enforcement officers may be appointed for terms not to exceed one year, and the appointments may be revoked by the local unit for cause after adequate hearing, unless the appointment is for four months or less, in which event the appointment may be revoked without cause or hearing. Nothing herein shall be construed to require reappointment upon the expiration of the term.  The special law enforcement officers so appointed shall not be members of the police force of the local unit, and their powers and duties as determined pursuant to this act shall cease at the expiration of the term for which appointed. b.    [No] A special law enforcement officer may carry a firearm [except] while engaged in the actual performance of the officer's official duties and [when specifically authorized by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit to carry a firearm and] at all times while in the State of New Jersey provided that the officer has satisfactorily completed the basic firearms course required by the commission for regular police officers and annual requalification examinations as required for permanent, regularly appointed full-time officers in the local unit. A special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty only while he is performing the public safety functions on behalf of the local unit pursuant to this act and when he is receiving compensation, if any, from the local unit at the rates or stipends as shall be established by ordinance.  A special law enforcement officer shall not be deemed to be on duty for purposes of this act while performing private security duties for private employers, which duties are not assigned by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit, or while receiving compensation for those duties from a private employer.  A special law enforcement officer may, however, be assigned by the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer, to perform public safety functions for a private entity if the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer supervises the performance of the public safety functions.  If the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer assigns the public safety duties and supervises the performance of those duties, then, notwithstanding that the local unit is reimbursed for the cost of assigning a special law enforcement officer at a private entity, the special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty. The reimbursement for the duties of a special law enforcement officer, which is made to a municipality with a population in excess of 300,000, according to the 1980 federal decennial census, may be by direct payments from the employer to the special law enforcement officer, provided that records of the hours worked are forwarded to and maintained by the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer responsible for assigning the special law enforcement officer those public safety duties. [Any firearm utilized by a special law enforcement officer shall be returned at the end of the officer's workday to the officer in charge of the station house, unless the firearm is owned by the special law enforcement officer and was acquired in compliance with a condition of employment established by the local unit.  Any special law enforcement officer first appointed after the effective date of this act shall only use a firearm supplied by the local unit.  No such special police officer shall carry a revolver or other similar weapon when off duty; but if any such special police officer appointed by the governing body of any municipality having a population in excess of 300,000, according to the 1980 federal census, who is a resident of the municipality and is employed as a special police officer at least 35 hours per week, or less at the discretion of the chief of police and mayor, shall, at the direction of the chief of police, have taken and successfully completed complete a firearms training course administered by the Police Training Commission, pursuant to P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-66 et seq.), and has successfully completed within three years of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.45 or three years of the date of appointment of the special police officer, whichever is later, 280 hours of training in arrest, search and seizure, criminal law, and the use of deadly force, and shall annually qualify in the use of a revolver or similar weapon, said special police officer shall be permitted to carry a revolver or other similar weapon when off duty within the municipality where he is employed.  Specific authorization shall be in the form of a permit which shall not be unreasonably withheld, which is subject to renewal annually and may be revoked at any time by the chief of police.  The permit shall be on the person of the special police officer whenever a revolver or other similar weapon is carried off duty.  No permit shall be issued until the special police officer has successfully completed all training courses required under this section.  Any training courses completed by a special police officer under the direction of the chief of police in a school and a curriculum approved by the Police Training Commission, pursuant to P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-66 et seq.), shall be credited towards the 280 hours of training required to be completed by this section.  Any training required by this section shall commence within 90 days of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.45 or within 90 days of the date of the appointment of the special police officer, whichever is later.] c.    A special law enforcement officer shall be under the supervision and direction of the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit wherein the officer is appointed, and shall perform his duties only in the local unit except when in fresh pursuit of any person pursuant to chapter 156 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes or when authorized to perform duties in another unit pursuant to a mutual aid agreement enacted in accordance with section 1 of P.L.1976, c.45 (C.40A:14-156.1). d.    The officer shall comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of the permanent, regularly appointed police officers of the local unit, as well as any rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of special law enforcement officers. e.    Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.8 et seq.) to the contrary, a special law enforcement officer may travel through another local unit to reach a noncontiguous area of the local unit in which his appointment was issued or to transport persons to and from a correctional facility. (cf: P.L.1991, c.46, s.1) 9.    Section 9 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.16) is amended to read as follows: 9.    a.  Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, no special law enforcement officer may be employed for more than 20 hours per week by the local unit except that special law enforcement officers may be employed by the local unit for those hours as the governing body may determine necessary in accordance with the limits prescribed below: (1)  In resort municipalities not to exceed 48 hours per week during any seasonal period. (2)  In all municipalities or counties without limitation as to hours during periods of emergency. (3)  In all municipalities or counties in addition to not more than 20 hours per week including duties assigned pursuant to the provisions of section 7 of this act a special law enforcement officer may be assigned for not more than 20 hours per week to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity. (4)  In municipalities or counties, as provided in subsection b. of section 7 of this act, for hours to be determined at the discretion of the director of the municipal or county police force. b.    Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, special law enforcement officers may be employed only to assist the local law enforcement unit but may not be employed to replace or substitute for full-time, regular police officers or in any way diminish the number of full-time officers employed by the local unit. c.    Each municipality or county may designate one special law enforcement officer to whom the limitations on hours employed set forth in subsection a. of this section shall not be applicable. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, a special law enforcement officer shall not be employed for more than 20 hours per week by the local unit unless the governing body of the county or municipality in which the special law enforcement officer is employed has purchased from an insurance company authorized to do business in this State liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. (cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.6) 10.  (New section) The governing body of a county or municipality shall give a leave of absence with pay to Class Two special law enforcement officers to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization.              A certificate of attendance to the State convention shall, upon request, be submitted to a supervising officer by a Class Two special law enforcement officer attending the convention.  Leave of absence shall be for a period inclusive of the duration of the convention with a reasonable time allowed for time to travel to and from the convention. 11.  (New section)  a.  As used in this section: Disciplinary action means any adverse personnel action, including suspension, reduction in pay, rank or other employment benefit, dismissal, transfer, reassignment, unreasonable denial of secondary employment or similar punitive action taken against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer. Disciplinary hearing means an administrative hearing initiated by the department against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer, based on an alleged violation of law or department, commission, or agency rule or regulation that, if proven, would subject the law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer to disciplinary action. "Investigation" means an action taken by the employing department, commission, or agency to determine whether a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer violated any law or department, commission, or agency rule or regulation and includes: (1) questioning any other State law enforcement officer or person; (2) conducting observations; (3) reviewing and evaluating reports, records, or other documents; and (4) examining physical evidence. b.    An employing department, commission, or agency may dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if: (1)  the department, commission, or agency determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental, commission, or agency rule or regulation; or (2)  the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the department, commission, or agency employing the officer. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes certain benefits for Class Two special law enforcement officers. Under current law, Class Two special law enforcement officers only have full police powers while on duty and are required to return their firearms to the officer in charge of their station at the end of each workday. This bill authorizes all Class Two special law enforcement officers who successfully complete the statutorily required training programs to exercise full police power and carry their firearms at all times when in this State.  The bill also allows arson investigators to carry a firearm at all times while in this State. In addition, the bill establishes new requirements for Class One and Class Two special law enforcement officers.  Specifically, the bill requires all special law enforcement officers to be between 21 and 75 years of age and to submit to a drug test at the time of appointment.  The bill also waives the training requirements to become a Class Two special law enforcement officer for persons who previously served as a full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer. This bill also clarifies that Class Two special law enforcement officers are granted the same protections as all law enforcement officers.  Under current law, a simple assault is upgraded to an aggravated assault if committed against a law enforcement officer while clearly identifiable as being engaged in official duties or due to law enforcement status.  Current law also makes it a fourth degree crime to impersonate a law enforcement officer and a second degree crime to knowingly take or attempt to exercise unlawful control over a law enforcement officers firearm.  This bill clarifies that the same penalties for the crimes of assaulting, impersonating, or disarming a law enforcement officer apply if committed against a Class Two special law enforcement officer.  The bill also specifically extends to Class Two special law enforcement officers the same immunity from civil liability granted to regular full-time law enforcement officers. Under the bill, Class Two special law enforcement officers would be permitted to act as security at polling place on the day of an election to ensure that qualified voters are not obstructed from voting.  The bill authorizes the automatic expungement of criminal charges that are filed against any law enforcement officer, including any Class Two special law enforcement officer, in the course of official duties if the officer is found not guilty.  Class Two special law enforcement officers also would be entitled to paid leave to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization.  Under current law, paid leave is only granted to members of an organization affiliated with the New Jersey Policemen's Benevolent Association, Inc., the Fraternal Order of Police, the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association or the Professional Fire Fighters Association. Currently, special law enforcement officers are prohibited from working more than 20 hours per week except: 1) during periods of emergency, 2) in resort municipalities, 3) or to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity.  This bill requires  counties and municipalities in which special law enforcement officers work more than 20 hours per week to purchase liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. The bill also allows a department, commission, or agency to dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a regularly appointed, full-time law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if it determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental rule or regulation.  A complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate also may be dismissed if the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the employing department. Finally, the bill expands the list of retired law enforcement officers who are eligible to receive a permit to carry a handgun to include retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service.  Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times.  Under this bill, retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service would be eligible to receive a carry permit.

(7)  The superintendent may charge a reasonable application fee to retired officers to offset any costs associated with administering the application process set forth in this subsection. m.   Nothing in subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using any device that projects, releases or emits any substance specified as being non-injurious to wildlife by the Director of the Division of Animal Health in the Department of Agriculture, and which may immobilize wildlife and produces only temporary physical discomfort through being vaporized or otherwise dispensed in the air for the purpose of repelling bear or other animal attacks or for the aversive conditioning of wildlife. n.    Nothing in subsection b., c., d. or e. of N.J.S.2C:39-5 shall be construed to prevent duly authorized personnel of the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife, while in the actual performance of duties, from possessing, transporting or using hand held pistol-like devices, rifles or shotguns that launch pyrotechnic missiles for the sole purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife; from possessing, transporting or using rifles, pistols or similar devices for the sole purpose of chemically immobilizing wild or non-domestic animals; or, provided the duly authorized person complies with the requirements of subsection j. of this section, from possessing, transporting or using rifles or shotguns, upon completion of a Police Training Commission approved training course, in order to dispatch injured or dangerous animals or for non-lethal use for the purpose of frightening, hazing or aversive conditioning of nuisance or depredating wildlife.

Unless a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer is convicted of a criminal offense for an action that occurred while in the performance of his law enforcement duties, all criminal records and reports relating to the arrest and subsequent investigation of that officer pertaining to that action shall be automatically expunged. (cf: P.L.2015, c.261, s.9) 6.    Section 3 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.10) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  Any local unit may, as it deems necessary, appoint special law enforcement officers sufficient to perform the duties and responsibilities permitted by local ordinances authorized by N.J.S. 40A:14-118 or ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, authorized by N.J.S.40A:14-106 and within the conditions and limitations as may be established pursuant to this act. b.    No person may be appointed as a special law enforcement officer unless the person: (1)  [Is] is a resident of this State during the term of appointment; (2)  [Is] is able to read, write and speak the English language well and intelligently and has a high school diploma or its equivalent; (3)  [Is] is sound in body and of good health; (4)  [Is] is of good moral character; (5)  [Has] has not been convicted of any offense involving dishonesty or which would make him unfit to perform the duties of his office; (6)  [Has] has successfully undergone the same psychological testing that is required of all full-time police officers in the municipality or county or, with regard to a special law enforcement officer hired for a seasonal period by a resort municipality which requires psychological testing of its full-time police officers, has successfully undergone a program of psychological testing approved by the commission; (7)  at the time of appointment, undergoes drug testing for controlled dangerous substances or controlled dangerous substance analogs; and (8)  is between 21 and 75 years of age. c.    Every applicant for the position of special law enforcement officer appointed pursuant to this act shall have fingerprints taken, which fingerprints shall be filed with the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. d.    [No] A person shall not be appointed to serve as a special law enforcement officer in more than one local unit at the same time, [nor shall] and any permanent, regularly appointed full-time police officer of any local unit shall not be appointed as a special law enforcement officer in any local unit.  [No] A public official with responsibility for setting law enforcement policy or exercising authority over the budget of the local unit or supervision of the police department of a local unit shall not be appointed as a special law enforcement officer. e.    Before any special law enforcement officer is appointed pursuant to this act, the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit shall ascertain the eligibility and qualifications of the applicant and report these determinations in writing to the appointing authority. f.     Any person who at any time prior to his appointment had served as a duly qualified, fully-trained, full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer in any municipality or county of this State and who was separated from that prior service in good standing, shall be eligible to serve as a special law enforcement officer consistent with guidelines promulgated by the commission. The training requirements set forth in section 4 of this act [may] shall be waived by the commission with regard to any person eligible to be appointed as a special law enforcement officer pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. (cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.3) 7.    Section 4 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.11) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  No person may commence his duties as a special law enforcement officer unless he has successfully completed a training course approved by the commission and no special law enforcement officer may be issued a firearm unless he has successfully completed the basic firearms course approved by the commission for permanent, regularly appointed police and annual requalification examinations as required by subsection b. of section 7 of this act.  There shall be two classifications for special police officers.  The commission shall prescribe by rule or regulation the training standards to be established for each classification.  Training may be in a commission approved academy or in any other training program which the commission may determine appropriate.  The classifications shall be based upon the duties to be performed by the special law enforcement officer as follows: (1)  Class One.  Officers of this class shall be authorized to perform routine traffic detail, spectator control and similar duties. If authorized by ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, Class One officers shall have the power to issue summonses for disorderly persons and petty disorderly persons offenses, violations of municipal ordinances and violations of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes. The use of a firearm by an officer of this class shall be strictly prohibited and no Class One officer shall be assigned any duties which may require the carrying or use of a firearm.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.4) 8.    Section 7 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.14) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.   Special law enforcement officers may be appointed for terms not to exceed one year, and the appointments may be revoked by the local unit for cause after adequate hearing, unless the appointment is for four months or less, in which event the appointment may be revoked without cause or hearing. Nothing herein shall be construed to require reappointment upon the expiration of the term.  The special law enforcement officers so appointed shall not be members of the police force of the local unit, and their powers and duties as determined pursuant to this act shall cease at the expiration of the term for which appointed. b.    [No] A special law enforcement officer may carry a firearm [except] while engaged in the actual performance of the officer's official duties and [when specifically authorized by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit to carry a firearm and] at all times while in the State of New Jersey provided that the officer has satisfactorily completed the basic firearms course required by the commission for regular police officers and annual requalification examinations as required for permanent, regularly appointed full-time officers in the local unit. A special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty only while he is performing the public safety functions on behalf of the local unit pursuant to this act and when he is receiving compensation, if any, from the local unit at the rates or stipends as shall be established by ordinance.  A special law enforcement officer shall not be deemed to be on duty for purposes of this act while performing private security duties for private employers, which duties are not assigned by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit, or while receiving compensation for those duties from a private employer.  A special law enforcement officer may, however, be assigned by the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer, to perform public safety functions for a private entity if the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer supervises the performance of the public safety functions.  If the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer assigns the public safety duties and supervises the performance of those duties, then, notwithstanding that the local unit is reimbursed for the cost of assigning a special law enforcement officer at a private entity, the special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty. The reimbursement for the duties of a special law enforcement officer, which is made to a municipality with a population in excess of 300,000, according to the 1980 federal decennial census, may be by direct payments from the employer to the special law enforcement officer, provided that records of the hours worked are forwarded to and maintained by the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer responsible for assigning the special law enforcement officer those public safety duties. [Any firearm utilized by a special law enforcement officer shall be returned at the end of the officer's workday to the officer in charge of the station house, unless the firearm is owned by the special law enforcement officer and was acquired in compliance with a condition of employment established by the local unit.  Any special law enforcement officer first appointed after the effective date of this act shall only use a firearm supplied by the local unit.  No such special police officer shall carry a revolver or other similar weapon when off duty; but if any such special police officer appointed by the governing body of any municipality having a population in excess of 300,000, according to the 1980 federal census, who is a resident of the municipality and is employed as a special police officer at least 35 hours per week, or less at the discretion of the chief of police and mayor, shall, at the direction of the chief of police, have taken and successfully completed complete a firearms training course administered by the Police Training Commission, pursuant to P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-66 et seq.), and has successfully completed within three years of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.45 or three years of the date of appointment of the special police officer, whichever is later, 280 hours of training in arrest, search and seizure, criminal law, and the use of deadly force, and shall annually qualify in the use of a revolver or similar weapon, said special police officer shall be permitted to carry a revolver or other similar weapon when off duty within the municipality where he is employed.  Specific authorization shall be in the form of a permit which shall not be unreasonably withheld, which is subject to renewal annually and may be revoked at any time by the chief of police.  The permit shall be on the person of the special police officer whenever a revolver or other similar weapon is carried off duty.  No permit shall be issued until the special police officer has successfully completed all training courses required under this section.  Any training courses completed by a special police officer under the direction of the chief of police in a school and a curriculum approved by the Police Training Commission, pursuant to P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-66 et seq.), shall be credited towards the 280 hours of training required to be completed by this section.  Any training required by this section shall commence within 90 days of the effective date of P.L.1985, c.45 or within 90 days of the date of the appointment of the special police officer, whichever is later.] c.    A special law enforcement officer shall be under the supervision and direction of the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit wherein the officer is appointed, and shall perform his duties only in the local unit except when in fresh pursuit of any person pursuant to chapter 156 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes or when authorized to perform duties in another unit pursuant to a mutual aid agreement enacted in accordance with section 1 of P.L.1976, c.45 (C.40A:14-156.1). d.    The officer shall comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of the permanent, regularly appointed police officers of the local unit, as well as any rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of special law enforcement officers. e.    Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.8 et seq.) to the contrary, a special law enforcement officer may travel through another local unit to reach a noncontiguous area of the local unit in which his appointment was issued or to transport persons to and from a correctional facility. (cf: P.L.1991, c.46, s.1) 9.    Section 9 of P.L.1985, c.439 (C.40A:14-146.16) is amended to read as follows: 9.    a.  Except as provided in subsection c. of this section, no special law enforcement officer may be employed for more than 20 hours per week by the local unit except that special law enforcement officers may be employed by the local unit for those hours as the governing body may determine necessary in accordance with the limits prescribed below: (1)  In resort municipalities not to exceed 48 hours per week during any seasonal period. (2)  In all municipalities or counties without limitation as to hours during periods of emergency. (3)  In all municipalities or counties in addition to not more than 20 hours per week including duties assigned pursuant to the provisions of section 7 of this act a special law enforcement officer may be assigned for not more than 20 hours per week to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity. (4)  In municipalities or counties, as provided in subsection b. of section 7 of this act, for hours to be determined at the discretion of the director of the municipal or county police force. b.    Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, special law enforcement officers may be employed only to assist the local law enforcement unit but may not be employed to replace or substitute for full-time, regular police officers or in any way diminish the number of full-time officers employed by the local unit. c.    Each municipality or county may designate one special law enforcement officer to whom the limitations on hours employed set forth in subsection a. of this section shall not be applicable. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, a special law enforcement officer shall not be employed for more than 20 hours per week by the local unit unless the governing body of the county or municipality in which the special law enforcement officer is employed has purchased from an insurance company authorized to do business in this State liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. (cf: P.L.2013, c.21, s.6) 10.  (New section) The governing body of a county or municipality shall give a leave of absence with pay to Class Two special law enforcement officers to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization.              A certificate of attendance to the State convention shall, upon request, be submitted to a supervising officer by a Class Two special law enforcement officer attending the convention.  Leave of absence shall be for a period inclusive of the duration of the convention with a reasonable time allowed for time to travel to and from the convention. 11.  (New section)  a.  As used in this section: Disciplinary action means any adverse personnel action, including suspension, reduction in pay, rank or other employment benefit, dismissal, transfer, reassignment, unreasonable denial of secondary employment or similar punitive action taken against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer. Disciplinary hearing means an administrative hearing initiated by the department against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer, based on an alleged violation of law or department, commission, or agency rule or regulation that, if proven, would subject the law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer to disciplinary action. "Investigation" means an action taken by the employing department, commission, or agency to determine whether a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer violated any law or department, commission, or agency rule or regulation and includes: (1) questioning any other State law enforcement officer or person; (2) conducting observations; (3) reviewing and evaluating reports, records, or other documents; and (4) examining physical evidence. b.    An employing department, commission, or agency may dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if: (1)  the department, commission, or agency determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental, commission, or agency rule or regulation; or (2)  the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the department, commission, or agency employing the officer. 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes certain benefits for Class Two special law enforcement officers. Under current law, Class Two special law enforcement officers only have full police powers while on duty and are required to return their firearms to the officer in charge of their station at the end of each workday. This bill authorizes all Class Two special law enforcement officers who successfully complete the statutorily required training programs to exercise full police power and carry their firearms at all times when in this State.  The bill also allows arson investigators to carry a firearm at all times while in this State. In addition, the bill establishes new requirements for Class One and Class Two special law enforcement officers.  Specifically, the bill requires all special law enforcement officers to be between 21 and 75 years of age and to submit to a drug test at the time of appointment.  The bill also waives the training requirements to become a Class Two special law enforcement officer for persons who previously served as a full-time corrections officer, sheriffs officer, or law enforcement officer. This bill also clarifies that Class Two special law enforcement officers are granted the same protections as all law enforcement officers.  Under current law, a simple assault is upgraded to an aggravated assault if committed against a law enforcement officer while clearly identifiable as being engaged in official duties or due to law enforcement status.  Current law also makes it a fourth degree crime to impersonate a law enforcement officer and a second degree crime to knowingly take or attempt to exercise unlawful control over a law enforcement officers firearm.  This bill clarifies that the same penalties for the crimes of assaulting, impersonating, or disarming a law enforcement officer apply if committed against a Class Two special law enforcement officer.  The bill also specifically extends to Class Two special law enforcement officers the same immunity from civil liability granted to regular full-time law enforcement officers. Under the bill, Class Two special law enforcement officers would be permitted to act as security at polling place on the day of an election to ensure that qualified voters are not obstructed from voting.  The bill authorizes the automatic expungement of criminal charges that are filed against any law enforcement officer, including any Class Two special law enforcement officer, in the course of official duties if the officer is found not guilty.  Class Two special law enforcement officers also would be entitled to paid leave to attend any State or national convention of the Special Police Organization.  Under current law, paid leave is only granted to members of an organization affiliated with the New Jersey Policemen's Benevolent Association, Inc., the Fraternal Order of Police, the Firemen's Mutual Benevolent Association or the Professional Fire Fighters Association. Currently, special law enforcement officers are prohibited from working more than 20 hours per week except: 1) during periods of emergency, 2) in resort municipalities, 3) or to provide public safety and law enforcement services to a public entity.  This bill requires  counties and municipalities in which special law enforcement officers work more than 20 hours per week to purchase liability insurance for acts or omissions committed by special law enforcement officers acting in the course of their official duties. The bill also allows a department, commission, or agency to dismiss a complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate against a regularly appointed, full-time law enforcement officer or Class Two special law enforcement officer without full investigation if it determines that the complaint does not constitute a violation of law or departmental rule or regulation.  A complaint filed by a private citizen or an inmate also may be dismissed if the complainant failed to substantially comply with the complaint procedure prescribed by the employing department. Finally, the bill expands the list of retired law enforcement officers who are eligible to receive a permit to carry a handgun to include retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service.  Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times.  Under this bill, retired arson investigators and Class Two special law enforcement officers who retire after four years of service would be eligible to receive a carry permit.
