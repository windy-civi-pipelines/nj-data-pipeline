Upon a law enforcement officers determination that a person under arrest is subject to subsection a. of this section, the law enforcement officer shall so notify the prosecutor.

If it appears to the prosecutor that the deportation of a person arrested subject to subsection a. of this section will adversely affect the investigation or prosecution of the crime for which the person has been arrested, or will prevent the person from providing relevant information or serving as a material witness for the investigation or prosecution of another crime, the prosecutor may seek a stay of removal as provided for under federal law. f. To facilitate the implementation of the provisions of this section, a law enforcement agency may enter into a voluntary agreement with the Attorney General of the United States pursuant to subsection g. of 8 U.S.C. s.1357.  For the purposes of paragraph 5 of Section II of Article VIII of the State Constitution, the costs associated with such an agreement incurred by a county or local law enforcement agency shall not be deemed to be an unfunded mandate. g. Upon the effective date of this section, the Attorney General of this State shall repeal or rescind every rule, regulation, directive, guideline, or policy that is not consistent with the legislative intent of P.L.     , c.     (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any rule, regulation, directive, guideline, or policy intended to implement the provisions of P.L.     , c.     (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be promulgated by the Attorney General only in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), and shall be subject to review by the Legislature pursuant to paragraph 6 of Section IV of Article V of the State Constitution. 3.    P.L.2021, c.199 (C.30:4-8.15 and C.30:4-8.16) is repealed. 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the New Jersey Laken Riley Act, establishes law enforcement procedures for cases where an alien unlawfully present in the United States is arrested and charged with certain crimes. Under the bill, an alien who is confirmed by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be an alien unlawfully present in the United States, and who is arrested for certain crimes, is presumed to require pretrial detention, notwithstanding the States Criminal Justice Reform Law (also known as bail reform).  The applicable crimes are any indictable crime of the first, second, third, or fourth degree; any motor vehicle violation involving bodily injury to another person; or any crime defined under federal law as an aggravated felony, serious criminal offense, or crime of violence. Additionally, the bill reforms certain law enforcement practices concerning illegal immigration.  First, the bill expressly authorizes and requires law enforcement officers to comply with immigration detainers requested by DHS.  Second, the bill expressly authorizes law enforcement agencies to enter into voluntary agreements with federal authorities to provide immigration enforcement services.  Third, the bill repeals the law banning prisons and jails in this State from serving as immigration detention facilities.  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General to rescind A.G. Directive 2018-6 v.2.0, commonly known as the Immigrant Trust Directive, which was issued on Sept. 27, 2019. Through this bill, it is the intent of the sponsor to align State law with federal immigration law, particularly the federal Laken Riley Act, Pub.L.119-1, signed into law by the President on January 29, 2025.
