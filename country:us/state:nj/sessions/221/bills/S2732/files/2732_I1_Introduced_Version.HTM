<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    This
act shall be known and may be referred to as the &quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization
Pilot Program.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)    The
Legislature finds and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Urban blight has
substantially reduced the taxable value of property in many neighborhoods in New
  Jersey's older cities, depriving these cities of the ability to raise
necessary taxes to support city services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The migration of the
middle class from the cities to the suburbs during the latter half of the 20th
Century started a cycle of poverty, neglect, and blight that continues to deter
reinvestment and resettlement of a middle class in order to reestablish a
middle class.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A root cause of urban
blight is the loss of the municipal tax base. Attempts to revitalize urban
areas through redevelopment projects and through the urban enterprise zone
program have met moderate success in business districts, but less success
within declining residential neighborhoods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A pilot program
specifically designed to attract college graduates to targeted areas in certain
cities may be a key component to the revitalization of our older cities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is therefore an
appropriate public purpose to establish a pilot program through the Urban
Enterprise Zone Authority to provide, as a financial incentive, for the reimbursement
of a certain portion of a college graduate's student loans in return for their
commitment to move into a targeted residential neighborhood for a period of at
least two years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      3. 
(New section)  a.  For the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill):</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      &quot;Fund&quot;
means the &quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization Student Loan Reimbursement
Fund&quot; established pursuant to subsection b. of this section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      &quot;Pilot
municipality&quot; means Camden City in Camden County, Trenton City in Mercer
County, Jersey City in Hudson County, and Paterson City in Passaic County.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      &quot;Pilot

participant&quot; means an individual who has been awarded a degree upon
graduating from an accredited two- or four-year institution of higher education

application for the pilot program.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      &quot;Regulated

by the authority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      &quot;Targeted
residential neighborhood&quot; means a delineated residential area within a
pilot municipality designated pursuant to subsection d. of this section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   There
is created a &quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization Student Loan
Reimbursement Fund&quot; to be held by the State Treasurer, which shall be the
repository for all monies required to be deposited therein in exchange for tax
credits granted under section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before
the Legislature as this bill), or transferred from the enterprise zone
assistance fund pursuant to section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   (1) 
The Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, working in consultation with the
Commissioner of Community Affairs, shall establish the Neighborhood Scholar
Revitalization Pilot Program with the purpose of offering college graduates
with student loan debt a financial inducement, in the way of student loan
reimbursement payments, in return for their commitment to relocate into a
targeted residential neighborhood for a period of at least 24 months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (2)  The
pilot program shall be limited to 200 qualified participants within each of the
four pilot municipalities.  New qualified participants may be added to replace
participants who fail to complete their 24-month commitment period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3)  Each
qualified participant shall enter into a written contract to maintain their
principal residence within a dwelling located within a targeted residential
neighborhood for a period of at least 24 months.  A qualified participant may
change residences during the 24-month commitment period, so long as they remain
within a targeted residential neighborhood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (4)  At
the completion of the 24-month commitment period, each qualified participant
shall be entitled to receive from the fund a student loan reimbursement payment
of $7,000, representing $3,500 for each 12-month period within the 24-month
commitment period. A reimbursement payment received pursuant to this section
shall not be included as income for the purpose of taxation under the &quot;New

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the
&quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization Pilot Program,&quot; is intended to
aid in the revitalization of declining neighborhoods in the older cities by
&quot;seeding&quot; them with a new middle class.  The bill establishes a pilot
program in four older cities, one in each region of the State, to try to
attract recent college graduates to enter into a two-year commitment to settle
within certain targeted residential neighborhoods.  The four initial cities
that will participate in the pilot program are Camden, Trenton, Jersey City,
and Paterson.  The cities would be responsible for identifying the targeted
residential neighborhoods, although those neighborhoods would have to be
primarily residential in character and located in a census tract in which the
median household income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the
housing region in which the census tract is located, as determined for a
three-person household by the Department of Community Affairs in accordance
with the latest federal decennial census.</p>

participating in the pilot program would be eligible to offer up to 200
qualified graduates a financial incentive to agree to maintain their primary
residence within a targeted residential neighborhood for a period of at least
24 months.  To qualify for participation in the program, a graduate would need
a degree from a two- or four-year accredited institution of higher education,
and proof of outstanding student loan indebtedness of at least $7,000.  At the
end of the required residency period, the program participant would be
reimbursed a total $7,000 towards their student loan obligations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This pilot program would be

(C.54:10A-1 et seq.) would be entitled to receive neighborhood scholar
revitalization tax credits for contributions made to the &quot;Neighborhood
Scholar Revitalization Student Loan Reimbursement Fund&quot; established by the
bill.  This would assist UEZ businesses in recruiting highly educated workers
by offering the student loan reimbursement program as an additional benefit. 
Monies from each pilot municipality's urban enterprise zone assistance fund
account could be transferred into the &quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization
Student Loan Reimbursement Fund&quot; for the purpose of funding student loan
reimbursements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that the
amount of the Corporation Business Tax (CBT) tax credit allowed to a business
would be equal to the amount of each annual regulated contribution by the
business to the &quot;Neighborhood Scholar Revitalization Student Loan
Reimbursement Fund&quot; established pursuant to section 3 of the bill, but
limited to 50 percent of the amount of tax otherwise due by the business in a
given tax year.  The bill provides for the carry-forward of unused tax
credits.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the end of three years, the
Urban Enterprise Zone Authority, in consultation with the Commissioner of
Community Affairs, would be required to report to the Governor and Legislature
on the success of the pilot program, and make recommendations regarding either
the expansion or termination of the pilot program.</p>
