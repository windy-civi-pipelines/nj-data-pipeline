District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) SYNOPSIS Redirects certain State funding for specific arts, cultural, and historic organizations to competitive grant program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act amending P.L.2022, c.49, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. Whereas, The fiscal year 2023 appropriations act includes an overabundance of special appropriations that benefit specifically-named public and private organizations and groups, including various arts, cultural, and historic organizations; and Whereas, These special, direct appropriations are included in the appropriations act without providing similar organizations and groups across the State the opportunity to earn these public dollars; and Whereas, The fiscal year 2023 appropriations act inappropriately singles out many arts, cultural, and historic organizations when other similar organizations have legitimate needs that have been ignored; and Whereas, State funds can be more fairly and efficiently allocated if they are redirected to a competitive grant program that recognizes the needs of all arts, cultural, and historic organizations and seeks regional balance in the distribution of monies; now, therefore, Be It Enacted by the Senate and the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The following items in section 1 of P.L.2022, c.49, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, are amended to read as follows: 22 DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AFFAIRS 50 Economic Planning, Development, and Security 55 Social Services Programs GRANTS-IN-AID 05-8050  Community Resources..........

Total available funding for the program, therefore, is $26.7 million. The grant program would provide funds to support the missions and financial and capital needs of qualifying arts, cultural, and historic organizations. Under the bill, the Secretary of State would establish reasonable eligibility criteria, and identify any priority funding areas, for the distribution of grants under the program. The bill requires, to the maximum extent possible, that funds awarded under the grant program would be allocated equally among the northern, central, and southern regions of the State.
