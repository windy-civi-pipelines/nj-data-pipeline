The current $15,000 limit of property taxes paid by homeowners or tenants on their principal residences is increased to $17,000 for tax year 2020.  Thereafter, this amount will be indexed and recomputed annually to reflect a cost-of-living adjustment based on the consumer price index for urban consumers as prepared by the U.S. Department of Labor. With property taxes increasing dramatically over the past few years, the maximum deduction amount should be increased to further assist the property taxpayers of this State.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.1) 3.    Section 4 of P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-18) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a. A resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction from gross income for that portion of the rent constituting property taxes [not in excess of $15,000, subject to the limitations of subsection d. of this section,] due and paid for the calendar year in which the rent constituting taxes is due and payable, for occupancy of that homestead.  The deduction shall not exceed $15,000 for taxable years before calendar year 2019, $17,000 for the taxable year beginning in calendar year 2020, and the maximum amount recomputed pursuant to subsection i. of this section for taxable year for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2021 and each year thereafter. b.    A husband and wife who elect to file separate income tax returns pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., shall each be entitled to one-half of the property tax deduction allowed pursuant to this section. c.     If more than one taxpayer, other than husband and wife, qualify to deduct rent constituting property taxes by reason of their having occupied the same rented homestead, it shall be presumed that the deduction shall be equally divided.  A taxpayer may, however, deduct an amount for rent constituting property taxes in the same proportion that the rent paid by that taxpayer bears to the total rent paid by all tenants of the same unit. d.    [Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1) a resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1996 based on 50% of the rent constituting property taxes not in excess of $5,000 paid for the occupancy of that homestead; and (2) a resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1997 based on 75% of the rent constituting property taxes not in excess of $7,500 paid for the occupancy of that homestead.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) e.     For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2021 and in each taxable year thereafter, the director shall annually recompute the maximum deduction amount allowed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, by multiplying the maximum deduction amount allowed in the prior taxable year by the cost-of-living adjustment.  The director shall round the recomputed maximum deduction amount next highest multiple of $5. (cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.2) 4.    Section 5 of P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  If a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction, [not in excess of $15,000, subject to the limitations of subsection b. of this section,] the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6) plus the amount of property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the property taxes are due and payable on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the rent constituting property taxes is due and payable for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property, provided however, that the amount of property taxes and property tax credits shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. through e. of section 3 and the amount of rent constituting property taxes shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. and c. of section 4 as may be applicable.  The deduction shall not exceed $15,000 for taxable years before calendar year 2019, $17,000 for the taxable year beginning in calendar year 2020, and the maximum amount recomputed pursuant to subsection i. of this section for taxable year for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2021 and each year thereafter. b.    [Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1996 based on 50% of an amount not in excess of $5,000, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property; and (2) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1997 based on 75% of an amount not in excess of $7,500, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) c.     For the taxable year beginning January 1, 2021 and in each taxable year thereafter, the director shall annually recompute the maximum deduction amount allowed pursuant to subsection a. of this section, by multiplying the maximum deduction amount allowed in the prior taxable year by the cost-of-living adjustment.  The director shall round the recomputed maximum deduction amount next highest multiple of $5. (cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.3) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the maximum amount of the homestead property tax deduction allowable for gross income tax purposes. The current $15,000 limit of property taxes paid by homeowners or tenants on their principal residences is increased to $17,000 for tax year 2020.  Thereafter, this amount will be indexed and recomputed annually to reflect a cost-of-living adjustment based on the consumer price index for urban consumers as prepared by the U.S. Department of Labor. With property taxes increasing dramatically over the past few years, the maximum deduction amount should be increased to further assist the property taxpayers of this State.
