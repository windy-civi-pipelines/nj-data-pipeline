(cf: P.L.2019, s.269, s.9) 6.    N.J.S.2C:52-14 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-14.   A petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be denied when: a.     Any statutory prerequisite, including any provision of this chapter, is not fulfilled or there is any other statutory basis for denying relief. b.    The need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having a person freed from any disabilities as otherwise provided in this chapter.  An application may be denied under this subsection only following objection of a party given notice pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-10 and the burden of asserting such grounds shall be on the objector. c.     In connection with a petition under N.J.S.2C:52-6, the acquittal, discharge or dismissal of charges resulted from a plea bargaining agreement involving the conviction of other charges.  This bar, however, shall not apply once the conviction is itself expunged. d.    The arrest or conviction sought to be expunged is, at the time of hearing, the subject matter of civil litigation between the petitioner or his legal representative and the State, any governmental entity thereof or any State agency and the representatives or employees of any such body. e.     [Except as set forth in subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2019, c.269 (C.2C:52-5.3) concerning a "clean slate" expungement petition, the person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged regardless of the lapse of time between the prior expungement, or sealing under prior law, and the present petition.  This provision shall not apply: (1)   When the person is seeking the expungement of a municipal ordinance violation, (2)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-6, or (3)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records of conviction for possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-2, when same is a hypodermic syringe or needle; possession with the intent to distribute drug paraphernalia pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-3, when same is a hypodermic syringe or needle; or possession or distribution of hypodermic syringe or needle pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-6.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2017, c.244) (cf: P.L.2021, c.403, s.2) 7.    N.J.S.2C:52-32 is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately, and apply to any expungement relief granted to any person thereafter, regardless of whether that person was previously granted an expungement. STATEMENT This bill would expand, in several ways, expungement eligibility to allow more persons to petition the Superior Court for expungement relief: - It would eliminate the cap on the number of convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses that a person could expunge; - It would eliminate the limitation on the number of times a person could be granted expungement relief based on convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses; - It would allow for convictions of first degree and second degree crimes for the sale or distribution of any form of controlled dangerous substance to be expunged, if the court found that the expungement is consistent with the public interest (such expungements are only currently permitted for convictions of either the third degree or fourth degree crime); - It would allow a so-called young drug offender (a person who is 21 years of age or younger at the time of committing the offense), who is eligible for expedited expungement relief under current law (see N.J.S.2C:52-5), to be granted such expedited relief even if that offender had violated a condition of probation or parole, has on record a conviction for another crime or violation of the States drug laws, or had a previous criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program; and It would repeal N.J.S.2C:52-32, which expresses the current State policy favoring limitations on the availability of expungement relief based on the number of convictions a person has or the number of times expungement relief was previously sought.

Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:52-2 and N.J.S.2C:52-3, after a period of not less than one year following conviction, termination of probation or parole or discharge from custody, whichever is later, any person convicted of an offense under chapter 35 or 36 of this title for the possession or use of a controlled dangerous substance, convicted of violating P.L.1955, c.77, s.3 (C.2A:170-77.5), or convicted of violating P.L.1962, c.113, s.1 (C.2A:170-77.8), and who at the time of the offense was 21 years of age or younger, may apply to the Superior Court in the county wherein the person resides or the county in which the persons conviction was disposed of for the expungement of such person's conviction and all records pertaining thereto.  [The relief of expungement under this section shall be granted only if said person has not, prior to the time of hearing, violated any of the conditions of his probation or parole, albeit subsequent to discharge from probation or parole, has not been convicted of any previous or subsequent criminal act or any previous or subsequent violation of chapter 35 or 36 of this title or of P.L.1955, c.277, s.3 (C.2A:170-77.5) or of P.L.1962, c.113, s.1 (C.2A:170-77.8), or who has not had a prior or subsequent criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program.] This section shall not apply to any person who has been convicted of the sale or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance or possession with the intent to sell any controlled dangerous substance except: (1)   [Marihuana] Marijuana, where the total sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was less than one ounce, or (2)   Hashish, where the total amount sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was less than five grams. (cf: P.L.2023, c.260, s.5) 5.    N.J.S.2C:52-8 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-8.     Statements to accompany petition.  There shall be attached to a petition for expungement: a.     A statement with the affidavit or verification that there are no disorderly persons, petty disorderly persons or criminal charges pending against the petitioner at the time of filing of the petition for expungement. b.    [In those instances where the petitioner is seeking the expungement of a criminal conviction pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-2, a statement with affidavit or verification that he has never been granted expungement, sealing or similar relief regarding a criminal conviction by any court in this State or other state or by any Federal court. "Sealing" refers to the relief previously granted pursuant to P.L.1973, c.191 (C.2A:85-15 et seq.).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     In those instances where a person has received a dismissal of a criminal charge because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or any other diversion program, a statement with affidavit or verification setting forth the nature of the original charge, the court of disposition and date of disposition. d.    A statement as to whether the petitioner has legally changed the petitioner's name, the date of judgment of name change, and the previous legal name.  If applicable, the petitioner shall provide a copy of the order for name change. (cf: P.L.2019, s.269, s.9) 6.    N.J.S.2C:52-14 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-14.   A petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be denied when: a.     Any statutory prerequisite, including any provision of this chapter, is not fulfilled or there is any other statutory basis for denying relief. b.    The need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having a person freed from any disabilities as otherwise provided in this chapter.  An application may be denied under this subsection only following objection of a party given notice pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-10 and the burden of asserting such grounds shall be on the objector. c.     In connection with a petition under N.J.S.2C:52-6, the acquittal, discharge or dismissal of charges resulted from a plea bargaining agreement involving the conviction of other charges.  This bar, however, shall not apply once the conviction is itself expunged. d.    The arrest or conviction sought to be expunged is, at the time of hearing, the subject matter of civil litigation between the petitioner or his legal representative and the State, any governmental entity thereof or any State agency and the representatives or employees of any such body. e.     [Except as set forth in subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.2019, c.269 (C.2C:52-5.3) concerning a "clean slate" expungement petition, the person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged regardless of the lapse of time between the prior expungement, or sealing under prior law, and the present petition.  This provision shall not apply: (1)   When the person is seeking the expungement of a municipal ordinance violation, (2)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-6, or (3)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records of conviction for possession with intent to use drug paraphernalia pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-2, when same is a hypodermic syringe or needle; possession with the intent to distribute drug paraphernalia pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-3, when same is a hypodermic syringe or needle; or possession or distribution of hypodermic syringe or needle pursuant to N.J.S.2C:36-6.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2017, c.244) (cf: P.L.2021, c.403, s.2) 7.    N.J.S.2C:52-32 is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately, and apply to any expungement relief granted to any person thereafter, regardless of whether that person was previously granted an expungement. STATEMENT This bill would expand, in several ways, expungement eligibility to allow more persons to petition the Superior Court for expungement relief: - It would eliminate the cap on the number of convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses that a person could expunge; - It would eliminate the limitation on the number of times a person could be granted expungement relief based on convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses; - It would allow for convictions of first degree and second degree crimes for the sale or distribution of any form of controlled dangerous substance to be expunged, if the court found that the expungement is consistent with the public interest (such expungements are only currently permitted for convictions of either the third degree or fourth degree crime); - It would allow a so-called young drug offender (a person who is 21 years of age or younger at the time of committing the offense), who is eligible for expedited expungement relief under current law (see N.J.S.2C:52-5), to be granted such expedited relief even if that offender had violated a condition of probation or parole, has on record a conviction for another crime or violation of the States drug laws, or had a previous criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program; and It would repeal N.J.S.2C:52-32, which expresses the current State policy favoring limitations on the availability of expungement relief based on the number of convictions a person has or the number of times expungement relief was previously sought.
