STATEMENT This bill establishes the Wind and Nuclear Production Apprenticeship Grant Program.  The program will provide grants to fund newly-established apprenticeship programs in the industries of wind energy and nuclear power in the State. To be eligible for the grant, the apprenticeship program is required to be accredited and approved by the United States Department of Labor.  The program will be administered by the Office of Apprenticeship in the department.  Each grant will be selected from either the wind energy or nuclear power industry, but any organizational sponsor of an apprenticeship program is eligible to receive the grant, including businesses; business organizations and associations; labor organizations; joint labor-management partnerships; local education agencies; public vocational schools; two-year and four-year colleges; local workforce development boards; workforce training providers; economic development organizations; and community-based and other non-profit organizations. Under the bill: Wind Energy Industry means an industry involved with the design, manufacture, construction, and maintenance of wind turbines or other wind power renewable energy sources. Nuclear Power Industry means an industry involved with the operation of nuclear-powered, electricity generation plants. Existing funds allocated from the Supplemental Workforce Fund for Basic Skills would be used for the cost of program.
