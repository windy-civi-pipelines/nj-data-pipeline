the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  There
is established in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development the Wind

to support funding for newly-established apprenticeship programs in the industries
of wind energy and nuclear power in the State. A grant may extend beyond one
year in duration.  To be eligible for the grant, the apprenticeship program
shall be accredited and approved by the United States Department of Labor, or
shall be in the process of obtaining that accreditation.  The program shall be
administered by the Office of Apprenticeship in the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Each grant shall be

any organizational sponsor of an apprenticeship program is eligible to receive
the grant, including businesses; business organizations and associations; labor
organizations; joint labor-management partnerships; local education agencies;
public vocational schools; two-year and four-year colleges; local workforce
development boards; workforce training providers; economic development organizations;

shall include documentation that the apprenticeship which the organization is
sponsoring is or will be accredited and approved by the United States

2024, the department shall begin accepting grant applications to be awarded no
later than January 1, 2025 from funds allocated for the program pursuant to
section 1 of P.L.2001, c.152 (C.34:15D-21). The department shall rank eligible

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the applicants

required to demonstrate that it intends and is prepared to contribute its own
financial resources to the apprenticeship program and has secured an industry

who is selected by the department for receipt of a grant for the purpose of
funding an apprenticeship program in accordance with P.L.    , c.    (C.       
) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall, on an annual basis for
so long as the grant is provided, make an annual report to the commissioner
detailing the enrollment in the program, the number of participants completing
the program, the number of participants obtaining employment as a result of the
program, and any other information as the commissioner may require.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Beginning January 1,

Development shall submit to the Governor, and to the Legislature, pursuant to
section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), a report that evaluates the
results of the program and its effectiveness in preparing individuals to meet
existing and burgeoning workforce needs and addressing gaps in skills in the
