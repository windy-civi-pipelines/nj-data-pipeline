For purposes of the bill, the term therapeutic purpose means for purpose of necessity to address the medical condition of the animal, such as an existing or recurring illness, infection, disease, injury, or abnormal condition in a claw that compromises the animals health.  Therapeutic purpose would not include cosmetic or aesthetic reasons or reasons of convenience in keeping or handling the animal. Under the bill, whenever a licensed veterinarian determines that an onychectomy or flexor tendonectomy is necessary for a therapeutic purpose, the veterinarian would be required to file a written statement with the Department of Health, and provide a copy of that statement to the owner or keeper of the animal.  A veterinarian who fails to comply with this provision would be subject to disciplinary action by the State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners. An onychectomy involves amputating the last bone of each toe on a cats paw with a scalpel, guillotine, or laser.  A flexor tendonectomy, involves severing the tendon that controls the claw in each toe, so that the cat keeps its claws, but cannot flex or extend them.  Sometimes they are medically necessary such as for the removal of cancerous tumors.
