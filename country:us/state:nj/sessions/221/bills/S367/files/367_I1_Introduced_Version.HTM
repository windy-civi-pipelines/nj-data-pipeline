<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     at the heart of fusion
energy is the worlds most famous equation, energy equals mass multiplied by
the speed of light, squared, which captures the relationship between mass and
energy; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    fusion is taking place
in laboratories all over the world, including in New Jerseys Princeton Plasma
Physics Laboratory, and is the process that powers the Sun and all the stars;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     fusion, unlike
traditional nuclear reactors, combines small atoms together to release energy with
the byproduct being helium gas; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    the key step, through
engineering, is to turn this science into a commercial product to generate
electrical power; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     it is important to the
economy of this State that a public-private partnership be established to
promote fusion technology-related industries in New Jersey and to attract
fusion technology companies to the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>
