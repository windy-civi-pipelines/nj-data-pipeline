(cf: P.L.2005, c.71, s.2) 3.  Section 3 of P.L.1991, c.92 (C.52:27D-198.3) is amended to read: 3.  An owner who sells, leases, rents or otherwise permits to be occupied for residential purposes any premises subject to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.92 (C.52:27D-198.1 et seq.) when the premises do not comply with the requirements of section 1 of P.L.1991, c.92  (C.52:27D-198.1), or without complying with the inspection and certification requirements of section 2 of P.L.1991, c.92  (C.52:27D-198.2), shall be subject to a fine of not more than [$500.00] $500 in the case of a violation for an alarm device, [or] a fine of not more than $100 in the case of a violation for a portable fire extinguisher, or a fine of not more than $1,000 in the case of a violation for a fire escape mechanism, which may be collected and enforced by the local enforcing agency as defined in subsection g. of section 5 of P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-196) by summary proceedings pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2005, c.71, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides for the implementation of additional fire safety measures in residential structures. This bill would require that in addition to smoke alarms and fire extinguishers, which are already required in certain residential structures, that such structures also be equipped with fire escape mechanisms.  A fire escape mechanism is defined as a device or system of devices which provide for the safe exit of a person or persons from a window when passage through the use of ground floor exits is inaccessible due to fire, smoke, or other life-threatening danger.  This bill also provides the Commissioner of Community Affairs with authority to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to implement this new safety measure. The fire escape mechanism requirement would be enforced by the municipality if it has an ordinance requiring inspections upon a change of occupancy, or by the appropriate fire code official in the event the municipality does not have an inspection ordinance.  The bill permits a penalty, not to exceed $1,000, to be imposed for a violation of the fire escape mechanism requirement.
