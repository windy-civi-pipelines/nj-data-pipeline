(3)   A pendente lite temporary guardian appointed pursuant to this section may be granted authority to arrange interim financial, social, medical or mental health services or temporary accommodations for the alleged incapacitated person determined to be necessary to deal with imminent critical needs of or imminent risk of substantial harm to the alleged incapacitated person or the alleged incapacitated persons property or assets.

The pendente lite temporary guardian shall communicate all actions taken on behalf of the alleged incapacitated individual to the alleged incapacitated persons attorney or attorney appointed by the court to represent the alleged incapacitated person, and to such other interested persons as the court may direct, who shall have the right to object to such actions. (6)   A pendente lite temporary guardian appointment shall not have the effect of an adjudication of incapacity or effect of limitation on the legal rights of the individual other than those specified in the court order. (7)   If the court enters an order appointing a pendente lite temporary guardian without [notice] a hearing, the alleged incapacitated person, or an interested person on his or her behalf, may appear and move for its dissolution or modification on two days notice to the plaintiff and to the temporary guardian or on such shorter notice as the court prescribes. (8)   Every order appointing a pendente lite temporary guardian granted without [notice] a hearing expires as prescribed by the court, but within a period of not more than 45 days, unless within that time the court, upon notice and hearing, extends it for good cause shown for the same period.

(9)   The pendente lite temporary guardian, upon application to the court, shall be entitled to receive reasonable fees for his services, as well as reimbursement of his reasonable expenses, which shall be payable by the [estate of the alleged incapacitated person or minor] plaintiff.

(11) If a pendente lite temporary guardian is appointed and the court, following a hearing, finds that the alleged incapacitated person was not incapacitated while under temporary guardianship, the alleged incapacitated person shall have an action in equity for the rescission ultra vires of any contract entered into or gifts made by the pendente lite temporary guardian in the name of the alleged incapacitated person. The pendente lite temporary guardian may seek indemnification from the plaintiff of the guardianship action. d.    Disclosure of information.

The alleged incapacitated person shall appear in court unless the plaintiff and the court-appointed attorney certify that the alleged incapacitated person is unable to appear because of physical or mental incapacity. f.     Communication.  When a person who is allegedly in need of guardianship services appears to have a receptive or expressive communication deficit, all reasonable means of communication with the person shall be attempted for the purposes of this section, including written, spoken, sign or non-formal language, which includes translation of the person's spoken or written word when the person is unable to communicate in English, and the use of adaptive equipment. g.    Additional subject areas. At the request of the limited guardian, and if the incapacitated person is not represented, after appointment of an attorney for the incapacitated person and with notice to all interested parties, the court may determine that a person is in need of guardian services regarding additional subject areas and may enlarge the powers of the guardian to protect the person from significant harm. h.    Limitations of guardian powers. At the request of the guardian, the incapacitated person or another interested person, and if the incapacitated person is not represented, after appointment of an attorney for the incapacitated person and with notice to all interested parties, the court may limit the powers conferred upon a guardian. (cf: P.L.2005, c.304, s.12) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the law concerning the appointment of pendente lite temporary guardians for an alleged incapacitated person. Under current law, the plaintiff in a guardianship action may seek the appointment of a temporary guardian on an emergent basis, prior to a hearing to determine whether a person is actually incapacitated and in need of guardianship. Because of its emergent nature, the court can grant the appointment without a hearing. While there are situations where an alleged incapacitated person may suffer imminent harm if a temporary guardian is not appointed, the likelihood of such harm must be weighed against the persons constitutional privacy and liberty interests. Under the bill, an application for pendente lite temporary guardianship must state the reason why emergent action is required and must make certain disclosures about any proposed temporary guardian. The bill provides that the court should appoint a temporary guardian only if there is an imminent risk of harm to the alleged incapacitated person. Under current Court Rule 4:86-2, a petition for guardianship must list the alleged incapacitated persons next of kin including a spouse or domestic partner, children, and parents, and any person named as attorney-in-fact in any power of attorney executed by the alleged incapacitated person, any person named as health care representative in any health care directive executed by the alleged incapacitated person, and any person acting as trustee under a trust for the benefit of the alleged incapacitated person. In conformity with Court Rule 4:86-2, the bill requires that those same persons receive notice of both the application for pendente lite temporary guardianship and the order granting the appointment. To increase the accountability of temporary guardians, the bill requires that any payments for interim financial, social, medical, or housing services made by the temporary guardian from the alleged incapacitated persons estate must be itemized and submitted to both the court and the alleged incapacitated persons attorney. The bill also requires the temporary guardian to maintain the status quo of an alleged incapacitated persons property, personal affairs, and business affairs, and requires court approval for any sale, gift, or disposal of assets. Additionally, while the temporary guardian may receive a reasonable fee and reimbursement of expenses, the bill requires that these fees and expenses must be court authorized and are payable by the plaintiff. Under the bill, if the court appoints a temporary guardian on an emergent basis and later finds after a hearing that a temporary guardian should not have been appointed, the alleged incapacitated person has the right of equitable rescission of any contract or gift made by the temporary guardian. Finally, because a temporary guardian is appointed on an emergent basis and only meant to serve for 45 days pending the outcome of the hearing to determine actual incapacity, a temporary guardian may be ordinarily exempt from the background screening and training requirements normally required of all proposed guardians. However, if the court extends the appointment after 45 days, bill requires temporary guardians to undergo these procedures. In the sponsors view, the guardianship process requires additional safeguards to prevent frivolous litigation, the wrongful disposal of a persons assets or the incursion of debt, abuse of the judicial process, and the unjust deprivation of personal autonomy.
