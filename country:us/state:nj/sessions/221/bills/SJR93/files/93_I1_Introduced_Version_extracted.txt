Despite the many challenges posed by remote instruction, the States educators successfully employed unique teaching strategies using online platforms to help students understand abstract concepts and develop critical-thinking skills, all of which are essential to academic development.  During this time, teachers also spent countless hours collaborating with parents to ensure that every student remains engaged with their schoolwork, even while many of these teachers continue to care for their own children who are also at home.  Although the societal effects of COVID-19 may recede with time, the contributions of educators during this public health emergency will always be remembered. In light of these contributions, it is altogether fitting and proper for the State of New Jersey to designate the first full week in May as Teacher Appreciation Week, which week has been annually observed as National Teacher Appreciation Week since 1985.
