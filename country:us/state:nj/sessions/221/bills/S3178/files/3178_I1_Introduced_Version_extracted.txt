STATEMENT This bill directs the Secretary of Higher Education to establish academic credit transfer standards and reverse credit transfer standards and establishes the position of New Jersey Transfer Ombudsman within the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education. Under current law, each public institution of higher education is required to establish and enter into a collective Statewide transfer agreement that provides for the seamless transfer of academic credits across public institutions of higher education.  Similarly, current law also requires institutions of higher education, both public and independent, to establish and enter into a collective Statewide reverse transfer agreement for the awarding of associate degrees by the county colleges.  This bill eliminates both the collective Statewide transfer agreement and the collective Statewide reverse transfer agreement and replaces them with standards for credit transfer and reverse transfer.  Under the bill, the standards are to be developed by the Secretary of Higher Education, in consultation with the New Jersey Presidents Council. The bill establishes the position of the New Jersey Transfer Ombudsman within the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education. The purpose of the ombudsman is to facilitate the resolution of disputes between students and public institutions of higher education regarding the institutions compliance with the credit transfer standards established pursuant to the bills provisions.  Under the bill, the ombudsman is to be responsible for: (1) final administrative decisions over disputes between students and public institutions of higher education regarding the transfer of academic credits; (2) the periodic review, occurring not less than once every three years, of the policies adopted by public institutions of higher education for the transfer of academic credit to ensure compliance with the credit transfer standards; and (3) preparation of the annual credit transfer report. The bill also requires each public institution of higher education to provide transfer students with data on program outcomes of students who have transferred from other public institutions of higher education in the State, including completion rates. The bill includes technical corrections to: (1) remove references in existing law to the collective Statewide transfer agreement and the collective Statewide reverse transfer agreement; and (2) update outdated references.
