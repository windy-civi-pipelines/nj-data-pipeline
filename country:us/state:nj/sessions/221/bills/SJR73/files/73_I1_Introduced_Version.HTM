STATEMENT This joint resolution designates November of each year as Transgender Awareness Month in the State of New Jersey, and respectfully calls on the Governor to annually issue a proclamation calling on public officials and citizens of this State to observe Transgender Awareness Month with appropriate activities and programs. Transgender individuals, who are people whose gender identity, expression, or behavior is different from those typically associated with the individuals assigned sex at birth, face considerable challenges in society, including discrimination, harassment, physical abuse, and social isolation. In the face of a sharp increase in anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation being introduced nationwide, with numerous bills seeking to limit access to health care, housing, education, and free expression for transgender individuals and transgender youth in particular, the Legislature finds it fitting and appropriate to increase awareness and understanding of the prejudice, discrimination, and violence that transgender persons face, as well as to recognize the beauty, strength, and resilience of the transgender community and the myriad contributions transgender individuals make to the life, culture, and social fabric of the United States.
