(cf: P.L.1989, c.263, s.7) 7.    (New section)  a. Except as provided in subsections b. of this section, a gasoline station may offer only full-service fuel, only self-service fuel, or a combination of full-service and self-service fuel. b.    A gasoline station with more than four dispensers shall offer for sale full-service fuel between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., provided that the station is open to the public during those hours. 8.    (New section) A gasoline station may offer a discount to customers who purchase motor fuel of like grade and quality that is dispensed by self-service at the station, provided that the motor fuel shall not be sold at a price which in violation of section 201 of P.L.1938, c.163 (C.56:6-2). 9.    (New section) a.  A gasoline station shall provide service by an attendant in the dispensing of every grade of fuel offered at self-service at no additional charge, if requested to do so by a person with a disability who is operating a motor vehicle bearing a placard or wheelchair symbol license plate, as authorized by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission pursuant to P.L.1949, c.280 (C.39:4-204 et seq.). b.    Every gasoline station offering exclusively self-service gasoline shall either: (1)   provide at least one refueling site with a calling device which allows a person with a disability, as described in subsection a. of this section, to signal an employee that refueling assistance is needed.  A calling device shall meet the following minimum specifications: (a)   provide a recognizable signal inside the retail establishment that a driver needs refueling assistance; (b)   be able to be operated from the vehicle using only one hand; (c)   have at least one sign next to it which identifies the device and specifies the hours when refueling assistance is available; and (d)   be able to be operated from the vehicle in accordance with all requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessibility Guidelines; or (2)   on every dispenser there shall be a decal, at least 15 square inches, which clearly displays the international symbol of accessibility, a working telephone number for the station, and the words Call for Assistance. c.     A gasoline station is not required to provide refueling assistance during those times that the station is being operated on a remote control basis by only one employee. 10.  (New section)  A franchisor or owner of a gasoline station shall not, as a condition of the franchise or lease for the gasoline station, as the case may be, require the gasoline station to be operated as a self-service only station, a full-service only station, or a station which offers both. 11.  (New section) a. The governing body of a county or municipality shall not adopt any ordinance, resolution, law, rule or regulation requiring or prohibiting gasoline stations to offer self-service dispensing of motor fuel in any capacity. b.    The provisions of this act shall preempt any ordinance, resolution, law, rule or regulation adopted by the governing body of a county or municipality prior to the effective date of this act regarding the availability of self-service of motor fuel. 12.  (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jersey is the only state in nation that maintains a full statewide prohibition on self-service gasoline sales. Since 1949, New Jersey has adhered to the full-service gasoline dispensing model, despite 49 other states fully or partially allowing self-service without negative repercussions; b.    New Jersey motorists who prefer to pump their own gas rather than wait for service from an attendant should not be denied this option by State law; c.     Motorist convenience will be enhanced with voluntary self-service dispensing of fuel as it will result in more stations being open in the evening, thus providing greater access and availability of motor fuel sources to customers; d.    New Jersey already has self-service dispensing for vehicles powered with diesel, battery electric, and other non-gasoline fuels; e.     Allowing motorists who choose self-service to benefit from a lower price will incentivize more consumers to purchase their gasoline from stations located in New Jersey, which will increase revenues dedicated to the Transportation Trust Fund. f.     By moving to a hybrid fueling model that includes both full-service and self-service dispensing, New Jerseyans and all commuters will have the freedom to choose how to fuel their vehicle, taking into account costs and wait times; g.    The Legislature further finds and declares, in concurrence with the findings of the staff of the Federal Trade Commission that: (1)   The current ban on self-service stations in New Jersey appears to impose substantial costs on consumers that are not likely to be offset by justifiable safety-related concerns; (2)   Voluntary self-service is no longer a threat to fire safety, with the advent of significant technological and safety improvements in self-service dispensing, such as nozzle valves that automatically shut off and the installation of emergency shut-off  switches near the pumps; (3)   As the conclusion of the Federal Trade Commission findings declare: Evidence indicates that safety problems associated with self-service stations do not appear significant, and that self-service gasoline retailing offers large potential savings to consumers.  For these reasons, we believe that consumers and visitors in New Jersey would benefit substantially if the ban on self-service were repealed and we moved to a hybrid fueling model that allows for both full-service and self-service fueling. 13.  Section 1 of P.L.1989, c.263 (C.34:3A-4) is repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment, except that the commissioner may promulgate regulations pursuant to sections 9 and 10 before the effective date. STATEMENT This bill allows the act of pumping one's own gas when a consumer voluntarily chooses to do so. The bill requires gasoline stations with more than four dispensers to continue to offer full-service gasoline between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., provided that the station is open to the public during those hours. The bill also stipulates that a gasoline station may offer a discount to customers who purchase motor fuel of like grade and quality that is dispensed by self-service at the station, provided that the motor fuel shall not be sold at a price which is below the net cost of that motor fuel to the gasoline station plus all selling expenses. Furthermore, the bill states that a gasoline station shall provide service by an attendant in the dispensing of every grade of fuel offered at self-service at no additional charge, if requested to do so by a person with a disability who is operating a motor vehicle bearing a placard or wheelchair symbol license plate. The bill also provides that gasoline stations offering only self-service gasoline shall provide assistance to motorists with a disability at the self-service price.  In order to enhance access for motorists, the bill gives gasoline stations the option of either outfitting at least one dispenser with a special call button or outfitting every dispenser with a sign listing a phone number that can be used to alert an employee of the gasoline station that assistance is needed. Consistent with federal law, the bill provides that a gasoline station is not required to provide refueling assistance when there is only one employee present.
