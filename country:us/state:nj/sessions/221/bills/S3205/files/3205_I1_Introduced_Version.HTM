The Pretrial Services Program was established in New Jersey in 2017 pursuant to the Criminal Justice Reform Act. A 2023 Report of the Reconvened Joint Committee on Criminal Justice made a recommendation to provide addition funding to enable the Judiciary to increase Pretrial Services Program staffing in order to ensure adequate oversight of the large number of defendants on pretrial release. During a March 7, 2024 Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, a similar concern about the lack of adequate resources for pretrial services was raised during oral and written testimonies. The Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts reiterated the recommendation for increased funding and staffing for pretrial services. Furthermore, during oral testimonies, multiple county prosecutors also underscored the need for additional funding for pretrial services, particularly with regard to staff and equipment for electronic monitoring of defendants. The FY 2025 Governors Budget recommends a $24.2 million for Statewide Pretrial Services Program, which is unchanged from the FY2024 appropriation of the same amount.
