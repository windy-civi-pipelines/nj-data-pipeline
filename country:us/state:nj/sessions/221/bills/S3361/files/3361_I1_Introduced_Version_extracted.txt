In the case of licenses and certificates issued by the New Jersey Board of Nursing, any such license or certificate issued or renewed after the effective date of P.L.    , c.

Licenses and certificates issued by the New Jersey Board of Nursing will continue to be valid for two years. The list of professionals licensed or certified through the New Jersey Board of Nursing includes registered professional nurses, licensed practical nurses, homemaker-home health aides, advanced practice nurses, and forensic nurses-certified sexual assault.  The bill will take effect 30 days after the date of enactment and will apply to any license or certificate issued by the Board of Nursing on or after that effective date.
