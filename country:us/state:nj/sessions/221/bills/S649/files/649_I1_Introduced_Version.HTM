occupancy of any building subject to the requirements of section 1 of P.L.1991,

notified in writing by a tenant that the tenant believes a substantial mold
hazard exists shall investigate the condition within 72 hours of receiving the
written notification.  If any visible signs of mold on surfaces are present,
the landlord shall clean and remove the mold from those surfaces in a manner
consistent with the regulations promulgated by the department.  Any leaking
pipes, roofing or walls which are contributing to a wet condition that in turn
is furthering the growth of mold shall be fixed in an expedited manner by the
landlord. Any mold conditions which will require testing to determine the
efficacy of the mold removal shall be performed by persons certified to
remediate mold in accordance with P.L.     , c.    (C.      ) (pending before
the Legislature as Assembly Bill No. 1007 of 2014).</p>

and which poses an immediate risk of continuing exposure to mold hazard for any
tenants living in rental housing. The commissioner shall determine whether the
removal of the residents from the rental housing unit containing that mold
hazard is warranted.</p>

determines that the removal and relocation of the residents from such housing
is warranted, then the commissioner shall authorize the payment of relocation

assist in the relocation of such residents to mold-safe housing.</p>

before the Legislature as this bill).  In a condominium, cooperative, or
planned real estate development with common elements, any mold, or condition
contributing to the formation of mold, which is not under the sole control of a
unit owner and which in any manner concerns a common element or facility, shall
be the duty of the homeowners association to remedy; any inspection fee for
and violation found within a unit which is solely related to a condition caused
by the owner within the individual unit shall be the sole responsibility of that
unit owner and not the homeowners' association, unless the homeowners association
is the owner of&nbsp;the&nbsp;unit.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Entitled the Mold-Safe
Housing Act, this bill would create mechanisms for tenants living in
mold-contaminated rental housing to have the mold effectively removed, or be
relocated to safer rental housing.  In addition, the bill provides a system of
inspection of all rental housing for the presence of mold.  Single family and
two-family rental housing will be required to be inspected upon a change in
occupancy, as well as every five years as part of the multiple dwelling
inspection.  Multiple dwellings will be inspected every five years for mold
under the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, which is enforced currently by the
Bureau of Housing Inspection in the Department of Community Affairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
prospective home purchaser can specify that an inspection for presence of mold
be performed by a licensed home inspector, should they retain such an inspector
prior to purchase.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits tenants whose
landlords fail to abate a mold hazard, upon written request to do so, to notify
the Department of Community Affairs, who shall investigate each claim and
determine whether to relocate the tenant.  Current relocation assistance laws
would apply in such circumstances.  In addition, the bill requires the court to
notify the department whenever a tenant is constructively evicted due to mold
or some other issue of habitability in the rental property.</p>
