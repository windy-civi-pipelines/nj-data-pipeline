STATEMENT This resolution urges the federal government to ensure that a rigorous and ongoing investigation is conducted into the presence of unidentified drones that have been operating in this State.  These mysterious drones have been sighted and reported in a large portion of the State, across more than a dozen counties, flying near critical infrastructure, sensitive military installations, and even President-elect Trumps residence at Trump National Golf Club in Somerset County.  The volume of drone sightings, nature of the areas in which they seem to fly most commonly, and manner in which the flights appear to be spreading across the State is alarming residents and causing fear and unrest.  The federal government should investigate the appearance of these drones and provide relevant and necessary information to State officials in a timely way to protect the security and well-being of New Jersey residents.
