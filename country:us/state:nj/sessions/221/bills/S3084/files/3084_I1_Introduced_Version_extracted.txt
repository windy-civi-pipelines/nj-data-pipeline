Subject to the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq., such notification shall finally and irrevocably fix the amount of the rebate unless the applicant, within 90 days after having been given notice of such determination, applies to the director for a hearing, or unless the director re-determines the same.  After such hearing the director shall give notice of the final determination to the applicant. b. An applicant for a rebate authorized under P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) who is aggrieved by any decision, order, finding, or denial by the director of all or part of that applicant's rebate may appeal therefrom to the New Jersey Tax Court in accordance with the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S. 54:48-1 et seq. The appeal shall be the exclusive remedy available to an applicant for review of a decision of the director in respect to the determination of all or part of a rebate authorized under P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     A rebate paid as a result of misrepresentation or paid in error, shall be payable to and recoverable by the director in the same manner as a deficiency with respect to the payment of a State tax in accordance with the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq. 5.    a.  The tax collector of each municipality shall, on or before April 1 of each year, furnish the director with a list of property taxpayers in the district who are delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies.  The collector shall report on such list the name, lot and block number on the property tax duplicate as may be applicable, and the address of each owner to whom a delinquency is attributable together with the amount of such delinquency so identified.  No rebate payment under P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be made to a property owner while that property owner's delinquency remains; provided, however, that for the purposes of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for an assessment on a property which is on appeal and for which the statutory percentage of the tax as provided in R.S.54:3-27 has been paid, the taxes assessed on that property shall not be regarded as delinquent. b.    If the director receives the list as provided for in subsection a. of this section, and the director determines that a property tax delinquency remains for the preceding tax year on April 1, the director shall ascertain the amount of the rebate required to be withheld because of such delinquency in each municipality in the State, and shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer as soon thereafter as may be practicable. c.     On or before November 15, the director shall notify each rebate claimant whose rebate has been withheld because of delinquency that the amount of the rebate to which the claimant otherwise would have been entitled has been sent to the tax collector in the municipality to be credited against the claimant's delinquency. d.    Upon certification by the director as to the amount of rebates required to be withheld because of delinquency in the several municipalities, the State Treasurer, upon the warrant of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall pay such amount on or before October 30 to the tax collector in each municipality. e.     The tax collector in each municipality shall credit the tax delinquency of each property taxpayer who appears on the delinquency list set forth in subsection a. of this section in the amount that otherwise would have been returned to the property taxpayer as a rebate.  In the event that the amount so credited by the tax collector exceeds the amount of delinquency, the tax collector may return the difference to the taxpayer or credit such amount to the subsequent property tax bill. f.     In the case of delinquency in the payment of property taxes by a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, a rebate that may be due an individual resident shall be paid by the State Treasurer to the tax collector of the municipality.  The tax collector shall credit the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community with such payment and the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community shall, in turn, credit the individual unit owner to the extent of the rebate and notify the applicant of the amount to be credited. g.    If a tax collector fails to comply with the provisions of subsection a. of this section requiring the tax collector to furnish the director with a list, on or before April 1 of each year, of property taxpayers in the district delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies, the director shall pay the rebate directly to the delinquent applicant rather than to the tax collector of the municipality as set forth in subsection d. of this section. 6.  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and to prescribe forms to administer the provisions of this act.  Notwithstanding any provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 to the contrary, the director may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such regulations as the director deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the filing. Such regulations may thereafter be amended, adopted or readopted by the director as the director deems necessary in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows veterans with a service-connected disability to receive a property tax rebate from the State in proportion to the percentage of their service-connected disability. The bill provides property tax relief to veterans who have a disability rating of less than 100 percent total and permanent disability. Veterans who have a disability rating of 100 percent total and permanent disability are already exempt from paying property taxes. Veterans with a service-connected disability are assigned a disability rating from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. A disability rating may range from 0 percent to 100 percent. That rating will determine the percentage of property taxes paid that the veteran will be allowed as a rebate under this bill. Funding for the rebate allowed by this bill is dependent on annual appropriations by the Legislature. The bill caps the rebate at $5,000 and limits availability of the rebate to veterans with gross income of up to $200,000.

The appeal shall be the exclusive remedy available to an applicant for review of a decision of the director in respect to the determination of all or part of a rebate authorized under P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     A rebate paid as a result of misrepresentation or paid in error, shall be payable to and recoverable by the director in the same manner as a deficiency with respect to the payment of a State tax in accordance with the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq. 5.    a.  The tax collector of each municipality shall, on or before April 1 of each year, furnish the director with a list of property taxpayers in the district who are delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies.  The collector shall report on such list the name, lot and block number on the property tax duplicate as may be applicable, and the address of each owner to whom a delinquency is attributable together with the amount of such delinquency so identified.  No rebate payment under P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be made to a property owner while that property owner's delinquency remains; provided, however, that for the purposes of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for an assessment on a property which is on appeal and for which the statutory percentage of the tax as provided in R.S.54:3-27 has been paid, the taxes assessed on that property shall not be regarded as delinquent. b.    If the director receives the list as provided for in subsection a. of this section, and the director determines that a property tax delinquency remains for the preceding tax year on April 1, the director shall ascertain the amount of the rebate required to be withheld because of such delinquency in each municipality in the State, and shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer as soon thereafter as may be practicable. c.     On or before November 15, the director shall notify each rebate claimant whose rebate has been withheld because of delinquency that the amount of the rebate to which the claimant otherwise would have been entitled has been sent to the tax collector in the municipality to be credited against the claimant's delinquency. d.    Upon certification by the director as to the amount of rebates required to be withheld because of delinquency in the several municipalities, the State Treasurer, upon the warrant of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall pay such amount on or before October 30 to the tax collector in each municipality. e.     The tax collector in each municipality shall credit the tax delinquency of each property taxpayer who appears on the delinquency list set forth in subsection a. of this section in the amount that otherwise would have been returned to the property taxpayer as a rebate.  In the event that the amount so credited by the tax collector exceeds the amount of delinquency, the tax collector may return the difference to the taxpayer or credit such amount to the subsequent property tax bill. f.     In the case of delinquency in the payment of property taxes by a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, a rebate that may be due an individual resident shall be paid by the State Treasurer to the tax collector of the municipality.  The tax collector shall credit the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community with such payment and the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community shall, in turn, credit the individual unit owner to the extent of the rebate and notify the applicant of the amount to be credited. g.    If a tax collector fails to comply with the provisions of subsection a. of this section requiring the tax collector to furnish the director with a list, on or before April 1 of each year, of property taxpayers in the district delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies, the director shall pay the rebate directly to the delinquent applicant rather than to the tax collector of the municipality as set forth in subsection d. of this section. 6.  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and to prescribe forms to administer the provisions of this act.  Notwithstanding any provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 to the contrary, the director may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such regulations as the director deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the filing. Such regulations may thereafter be amended, adopted or readopted by the director as the director deems necessary in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows veterans with a service-connected disability to receive a property tax rebate from the State in proportion to the percentage of their service-connected disability. The bill provides property tax relief to veterans who have a disability rating of less than 100 percent total and permanent disability. Veterans who have a disability rating of 100 percent total and permanent disability are already exempt from paying property taxes. Veterans with a service-connected disability are assigned a disability rating from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. A disability rating may range from 0 percent to 100 percent. That rating will determine the percentage of property taxes paid that the veteran will be allowed as a rebate under this bill. Funding for the rebate allowed by this bill is dependent on annual appropriations by the Legislature. The bill caps the rebate at $5,000 and limits availability of the rebate to veterans with gross income of up to $200,000.
