<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows veterans with
a service-connected disability to receive a property tax rebate from the State
in proportion to the percentage of their service-connected disability. The bill
provides property tax relief to veterans who have a disability rating of less
than 100 percent total and permanent disability. Veterans who have a disability
rating of 100 percent total and permanent disability are already exempt from
paying property taxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Veterans with a
service-connected disability are assigned a disability rating from the United
States Department of Veterans Affairs. A disability rating may range from 0
percent to 100 percent. That rating will determine the percentage of property
taxes paid that the veteran will be allowed as a rebate under this bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Funding for the rebate allowed
by this bill is dependent on annual appropriations by the Legislature. The bill
caps the rebate at $5,000 and limits availability of the rebate to veterans
with gross income of up to $200,000. </p>
