detailing obligations of the awardee and outcomes relating to events of default, including, but not limited to, recapture, forfeiture, and termination, except that in the event of a recapture of tax

authority may determine necessary to implement this provision, including, but not limited to, a definition of reasons outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner,1 the authority [shall] may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has been given, but for which the authority has not approved final documentation, shall [terminate] be reduced to eliminate the portion of the tax credits only available by virtue of such designation.

the purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate.  The authority shall establish a non-binding, administrative pre-certification process for potentially eligible projects.

Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54A:4-12b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362).

Beginning in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024, in addition to the total amount of tax credits and tax credit transfer certificates allowed to taxpayers for privilege periods or taxable years commencing during a single fiscal year under subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), up to an additional $100,000,000 may be made available, in the discretion of the authority for the award of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, pursuant to subsection b. of this section and subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b), from the funds made available to taxpayers other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362). Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000;

authority may determine necessary to implement this provision, including, but not limited to, a definition of reasons outside the control of the New Jersey studio partner,1 the authority [shall] may recapture the portion of the tax credit that was only available to the taxpayer by virtue of the taxpayer's designation as a New Jersey studio partner, and all films for which an initial approval has

Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, for any fiscal year in which the amount of tax credits approved pursuant to this paragraph is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining from the prior fiscal year.  The authority shall also certify, for each fiscal year, the amount of tax credits that were previously approved, but that the taxpayer is not able to redeem or transfer to another taxpayer under this section, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in the subsequent fiscal year by the amount of tax credits previously approved, but not subject to redemption or transfer. g.    A taxpayer shall submit to the authority and the director a report prepared by an independent certified public accountant licensed in this State to verify the taxpayer's tax credit claim following the completion of the production.  A New Jersey studio partner that makes deferred compensation payments based on work or services provided on a production may file a supplemental report prepared by an independent certified public accountant, pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, no later than [two] four years after the date on which the production concludes.  The deferred compensation payments, including deferred compensation payments made directly to a bona fide labor union, shall constitute qualified film production expenses as if the expenses were incurred at the time of production, provided there are credits available and subject to the authority's review. The report shall be prepared by the independent certified public accountant pursuant to agreed-upon procedures prescribed by the authority and the director, and shall include such information and documentation as shall be determined to be necessary by the authority and the director to substantiate the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  A single report with attachments deemed necessary by the authority shall be submitted electronically.  Upon receipt of the report, the authority and the director shall review the findings of the independent certified public accountant's report, and shall make a determination as to the qualified film production expenses or the qualified digital media content production expenses of the taxpayer.  The authority's and the director's review shall include, but shall not be limited to: a review of all non-payroll qualified film production expense items and non-payroll digital media content production expense items over $20,000;
