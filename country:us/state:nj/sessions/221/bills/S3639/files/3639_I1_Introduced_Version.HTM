TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senators McKnight and Singleton SYNOPSIS Establishes Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act establishing the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act; revising various parts of the statutory law and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. 2.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.), requiring that 15 percent of contracts be awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses, and three percent to women-owned businesses. b.  In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. (Croson), 488 U.S. 469 (1989), that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for minority businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it did not meet the Courts strict scrutiny standard. c.  Following the Croson decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race and gender discrimination in State procurement. d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination in Public Work Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the Study Commission to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence of any prior to present discrimination. e.  The Study Commission released the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and the anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which the State passively participated. f.  Governor Florio issued Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act, requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein they would make a good faith effort to award seven percent of public procurement and construction contracts to minority businesses and three percent to women-owned businesses. g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court in the matter of GEOD v. State of New Jersey, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC) (D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses and instead instituting a race- and gender-neutral small business set-aside program. h.  In 2005, the State released an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development, tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-and gender-neutral means. i.  On January 23, 2024, the State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020. j.  Despite decades of a race- and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting with minority and women-owned business enterprises including specifically in contracting with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans and women for formal prime contracts in construction, professional services, and goods and services and for informal prime contracts across all industries studied. k.  The State has a compelling interest in promoting markets free of discrimination to engage contractors and subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors. l.  It is the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting. m.  In an effort to reduce barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State contracting, State agencies and prime contractors should be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good faith effort to increase participation by such businesses. n.  The contracting goals set forth in P.L.   , c.  (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity study released in January of 2024 and are tailored to address the reports findings of significant statistical disparities in the States contract awards. 3.    (New section) As used in P.L.   , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Asian American-owned business means a business which has its principal place of business in the State, is independently owned and operated, and is a sole proprietorship owned and controlled by an Asian American male; a partnership or joint venture owned and controlled by Asian American males in which at least 51 percent of the ownership interest is held by Asian American males and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more of the Asian American males who own it; or a corporation or other entity whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more Asian American males who own it, and of which at least 51 percent of the legal beneficial ownership is held by one or more Asian American males. Black American-owned business means a business which has its principal place of business in the State, is independently owned and operated, and is a sole proprietorship owned and controlled by a Black American male; a partnership or joint venture owned and controlled by Black American males in which at least 51 percent of the ownership interest is held by Black American males and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more of the Black American males who own it; or a corporation or other entity whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more Black American males who own it, and of which at least 51 percent of the legal beneficial ownership is held by one or more Black American males.

(1) All State agencies shall establish programs consistent with P.L.    , c.   (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to facilitate the participation of minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses.  All State agencies shall develop a plan for the fiscal year next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and for each fiscal year thereafter to encourage minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses to submit proposals for, and be awarded, contracts in accordance with P.L.    , c.  (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant thereto.  Annually, within 180 calendar days of the end of each State fiscal year, a State agency shall file with the office, a report containing information requested by the Chief. The office shall receive and analyze these State agency reports and provide feedback to the submitting State agencies, as it deems necessary. (2) (a) Beginning on the effective date of P.L.   , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the goals established by all State agencies for contract utilization in a State Fiscal Year shall be as follows; provided, however, the Chief may interpret the disparity study and further tailor the goals to specific contract price ranges on a bid-by-bid basis: (i) at least 7.2 percent of their construction contracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 7.44 percent of their construction subcontracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 6.77 percent of their goods and services contracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 7.75 percent of their professional services contracts for Black American-owned businesses, and at least 7.81 percent of their professional services subcontracts for Black American-owned businesses; (ii) at least 5.37 percent of their construction contracts for Asian American-owned businesses, at least 6.87 percent of their construction subcontracts for Asian American-owned businesses, and at least 3.95 percent of their goods and services contracts for Asian American-owned businesses; (iii) at least 10.14 percent of their construction contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, at least 6 percent of their goods and services contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, at least 4.05 percent of their professional services contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, and at least 7.31 percent of their professional services subcontracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses; and (iv) at least 24.26 percent of their construction contracts for women-owned businesses, 5.73 percent of the construction subcontracts for women-owned businesses, at least 27.63 percent of their goods and services contracts for women-owned businesses, at least 37.59 percent of their professional services contracts for women-owned businesses; and at least 28.33 percent of their professional services subcontracts for women-owned businesses. (b) Whenever there exists (i) a persuasive analysis that documents a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of minority-owned businesses or (ii) a persuasive analysis that documents evidence of a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of women-owned businesses, or (iii) an appropriate basis to set a goal for any other group of under-represented businesses, State agencies are authorized and encouraged to implement appropriate adjustments and additions to the goals set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph to implement remedial measures consistent with prevailing law, as appropriate, and encourage the elimination of disparities between the award of contracts to minority and women-owned businesses and the availability of minority and women-owned businesses to perform such contracts.  State agency-specific goals adopted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be based on the finding of the most recently completed State-sponsored disparity study analyzing the data of the State agency. (3) (a) Each State agency shall make a good faith effort to attain the goals established in this section.  Each State agency that substantially fails to make a good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in subsection a. of this section in such agencys contracting shall be required to submit to the Chief, for approval, a remedial action plan to remedy such failure.  If it is determined by the Chief that any State agency has failed to act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan, within one year, the Chief shall provide written notice of such a finding, which shall be made publicly available, and shall compel direct implementation of remedial actions, which may include but shall not be limited to: (i) assuring that sufficient and effective solicitation efforts to minority and women-owned businesses are being made by the State agency; (ii) dividing contract requirements, when economically feasible, into quantities that will expand the participation of minority and women-owned businesses; (iii) eliminating extended experience or capitalization requirements, when programmatically and economically feasible, to expand participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (iv) other remedial actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b) Upon a finding by the Chief that a State agency has failed to take affirmative measures to implement the remedial plan and to follow any of the remedial actions set forth by the Chief, and in the absence of any objective progress towards the State agencys goals, the Chief may require some or all the State agencys procurement, for a specified period of time, be placed under the direction and control of another agency or agencies. (4) A State agencys good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this section shall be evidenced by documentation showing that the State agency: (a) considered structuring contracts in a manner to allow underutilized bidders to be able to compete for the State agencys contracts; (b) conducted periodic opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to learn of the State agencys general anticipated contract needs prior to advertisement independent of a published bid solicitation and to learn about the State agencys contracting practices and requirements; (c) conducted periodic outreach to business associations representing minority and women-owned businesses to publicize the State agencys contracting opportunities; (d) used the States central certification registry or a similar dataset to identify and notify all listed minority and women-owned businesses in the relevant market of the opportunity to submit a bid for a contract subject to goals for which the respective businesses qualify; and (e) took other actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). b.  For purposes of attaining the goals set forth in this section, State agencies may establish bid criteria for contracts or portions of contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority-owned businesses or women-owned businesses, though the State agency may still award the contract to a bidder that is not a minority-owned business or women-owned business.  The goals established in subsection a. of this section shall not be required to be attained independently and may be attained through contracts awarded to businesses that qualify as minority-owned businesses or women-owned businesses and may count towards more than one goal. c.  In setting and achieving the goals set forth in this section, a State agency shall: (1) consult the findings contained within the disparity study evidencing relevant industry-specific disparities in the utilization of minority and women-owned businesses relative to their availability or conduct another disparity study and consult the findings therein; (2) implement a program that will enable the State agency to evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate goal for participation by minority and women-owned businesses; (3) consider where practicable, the severability of construction projects and other bundled contracts; (4) consider compliance with the requirements of any federal law concerning opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses which effectuates the purpose of this section.  The State agency shall determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any such law duplicate or conflict with the provisions hereof and if such duplication or conflict exists, the State agency shall waive the applicability of this section to the extent of such duplication or conflict; and (5) take any other action that the Chief determines to be appropriate in rules adopted by the State Treasurer. d.  (1) Each prime contractor shall make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals established in this section. For purposes of determining a contractors good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section, the State agency shall consider: (a) whether the contractor has advertised the opportunity to, or otherwise made  minority and women-owned business aware of the opportunity, in such event, (i) whether minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses exhibited interest in working with the contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency awarding the contract; and (ii) whether minority and women-owned businesses, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage minority and women-owned businesses prior to the State agencys bid date; (b) whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities on the contract to appropriate minority and women-owned businesses that appear in the States central contractor registry which lists businesses certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State program; (c) whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (d) whether other actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), were taken. (2) Failure on the part of a contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be grounds for the rejection of bids made by that contractor on the contract for which the contractor is required to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section. 5.  Section 3 of P.L.1987, c.318 (C.5:10-21.1a) is amended to read as follows: 3.  The authority is authorized and directed to establish, prior to initiating any project on or after the effective date of this 1987 amendatory and supplementary act, small business [, minority business and women's business] set-aside contract goals and procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses [, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses], " P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.).

Before the expiration of the rules and regulations, the State Treasurer shall amend, adopt, or readopt the rules and regulations in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 21.  (New section) The provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional, the decision of the court shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this act. 22.  Section 1 of P.L.1995, c.39 (C.52:32-22.1) and section 4 of P.L.2011, c.147 (C.52:32-52) and are repealed. 23.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to contracts awarded on and after the 181st day next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act, amends the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, and repeals various sections of the statutory law. The Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act establishes a new process for determining preference in awarding State agency contracts.  State agencies are required to develop a plan for the fiscal year following the effective date of the bill and each fiscal year thereafter to encourage minority and women-owned businesses to submit proposals and encourage the awarding of contracts to those businesses.  The bill establishes contract utilization goals for all State agencies based on the New Jersey Disparity Study on the Availability and Utilization of Small, Minority, Women, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses published in January of 2024.  The State agency may adjust the percentages based on persuasive analysis that documents a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of minority and women-owned businesses.  In an effort to achieve the goals, the agency may establish bid criteria for contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority and women-owned businesses. State agencies are required to make a good faith effort to attain the goals set forth in the bill.  If the agency fails to make a good faith effort, a remedial action plan will be submitted to the Chief Diversity Officer.  If it is determined by the Chief that the agency did not act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan within one year, the Chief may make the remedial action plan public to encourage implementation.  If implementation still does not occur, the Chief may require that some or all of the agencys procurement be placed under the direction and control of another agency.  Prime contractors are also required to make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals set forth in the bill.  Failure by a prime contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may result in grounds for rejection of bids made by the prime contractor. The bill amends the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses to only be applicable to small businesses by removing mentions of female and minority-owned businesses.  The bill shifts chief, office, and departmental duties from the Chief of the Office of Small Business Assistance, the Office of Small Business Assistance, and the Department of Commerce and Economic Development to the Chief Diversity Officer, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and the Department of the Treasury.  The bill changes the set-aside goals for small businesses from 15 percent to 25 percent and removes goals for minority and women-owned businesses. The bill establishes a goal that State agencies award at least 30 percent of their contracts to socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. The bill repeals the law establishing compliance calculations for contracting agencies awarding contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, P.L.1995, c.39 (C.52:32-22.1), and repeals the law establishing the goal of giving due consideration to veteran-owned businesses and the requirement that strategies be identified to expand the number of veteran-owned businesses interested in and eligible to benefit from State procurement, P.L.2011, c.147 (C.52:32-52).

S3639 SENATE, No. 3639 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEPTEMBER 19, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senators McKnight and Singleton SYNOPSIS Establishes Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act establishing the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act; revising various parts of the statutory law and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. 2.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.), requiring that 15 percent of contracts be awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses, and three percent to women-owned businesses. b.  In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. (Croson), 488 U.S. 469 (1989), that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for minority businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it did not meet the Courts strict scrutiny standard. c.  Following the Croson decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race and gender discrimination in State procurement. d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination in Public Work Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the Study Commission to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence of any prior to present discrimination. e.  The Study Commission released the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and the anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which the State passively participated. f.  Governor Florio issued Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act, requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein they would make a good faith effort to award seven percent of public procurement and construction contracts to minority businesses and three percent to women-owned businesses. g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court in the matter of GEOD v. State of New Jersey, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC) (D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses and instead instituting a race- and gender-neutral small business set-aside program. h.  In 2005, the State released an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development, tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-and gender-neutral means. i.  On January 23, 2024, the State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020. j.  Despite decades of a race- and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting with minority and women-owned business enterprises including specifically in contracting with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans and women for formal prime contracts in construction, professional services, and goods and services and for informal prime contracts across all industries studied. k.  The State has a compelling interest in promoting markets free of discrimination to engage contractors and subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors. l.  It is the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting. m.  In an effort to reduce barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State contracting, State agencies and prime contractors should be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good faith effort to increase participation by such businesses. n.  The contracting goals set forth in P.L.   , c.  (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity study released in January of 2024 and are tailored to address the reports findings of significant statistical disparities in the States contract awards. 3.    (New section) As used in P.L.   , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Asian American-owned business means a business which has its principal place of business in the State, is independently owned and operated, and is a sole proprietorship owned and controlled by an Asian American male; a partnership or joint venture owned and controlled by Asian American males in which at least 51 percent of the ownership interest is held by Asian American males and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more of the Asian American males who own it; or a corporation or other entity whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more Asian American males who own it, and of which at least 51 percent of the legal beneficial ownership is held by one or more Asian American males. Black American-owned business means a business which has its principal place of business in the State, is independently owned and operated, and is a sole proprietorship owned and controlled by a Black American male; a partnership or joint venture owned and controlled by Black American males in which at least 51 percent of the ownership interest is held by Black American males and the management and daily business operations of which are controlled by one or more of the Black American males who own it; or a corporation or other entity whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more Black American males who own it, and of which at least 51 percent of the legal beneficial ownership is held by one or more Black American males.

(2) (a) Beginning on the effective date of P.L.   , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the goals established by all State agencies for contract utilization in a State Fiscal Year shall be as follows; provided, however, the Chief may interpret the disparity study and further tailor the goals to specific contract price ranges on a bid-by-bid basis: (i) at least 7.2 percent of their construction contracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 7.44 percent of their construction subcontracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 6.77 percent of their goods and services contracts for Black American-owned businesses, at least 7.75 percent of their professional services contracts for Black American-owned businesses, and at least 7.81 percent of their professional services subcontracts for Black American-owned businesses; (ii) at least 5.37 percent of their construction contracts for Asian American-owned businesses, at least 6.87 percent of their construction subcontracts for Asian American-owned businesses, and at least 3.95 percent of their goods and services contracts for Asian American-owned businesses; (iii) at least 10.14 percent of their construction contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, at least 6 percent of their goods and services contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, at least 4.05 percent of their professional services contracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses, and at least 7.31 percent of their professional services subcontracts for Hispanic American-owned businesses; and (iv) at least 24.26 percent of their construction contracts for women-owned businesses, 5.73 percent of the construction subcontracts for women-owned businesses, at least 27.63 percent of their goods and services contracts for women-owned businesses, at least 37.59 percent of their professional services contracts for women-owned businesses; and at least 28.33 percent of their professional services subcontracts for women-owned businesses. (b) Whenever there exists (i) a persuasive analysis that documents a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of minority-owned businesses or (ii) a persuasive analysis that documents evidence of a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of women-owned businesses, or (iii) an appropriate basis to set a goal for any other group of under-represented businesses, State agencies are authorized and encouraged to implement appropriate adjustments and additions to the goals set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph to implement remedial measures consistent with prevailing law, as appropriate, and encourage the elimination of disparities between the award of contracts to minority and women-owned businesses and the availability of minority and women-owned businesses to perform such contracts.  State agency-specific goals adopted pursuant to this subparagraph shall be based on the finding of the most recently completed State-sponsored disparity study analyzing the data of the State agency. (3) (a) Each State agency shall make a good faith effort to attain the goals established in this section.  Each State agency that substantially fails to make a good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in subsection a. of this section in such agencys contracting shall be required to submit to the Chief, for approval, a remedial action plan to remedy such failure.  If it is determined by the Chief that any State agency has failed to act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan, within one year, the Chief shall provide written notice of such a finding, which shall be made publicly available, and shall compel direct implementation of remedial actions, which may include but shall not be limited to: (i) assuring that sufficient and effective solicitation efforts to minority and women-owned businesses are being made by the State agency; (ii) dividing contract requirements, when economically feasible, into quantities that will expand the participation of minority and women-owned businesses; (iii) eliminating extended experience or capitalization requirements, when programmatically and economically feasible, to expand participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (iv) other remedial actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b) Upon a finding by the Chief that a State agency has failed to take affirmative measures to implement the remedial plan and to follow any of the remedial actions set forth by the Chief, and in the absence of any objective progress towards the State agencys goals, the Chief may require some or all the State agencys procurement, for a specified period of time, be placed under the direction and control of another agency or agencies. (4) A State agencys good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this section shall be evidenced by documentation showing that the State agency: (a) considered structuring contracts in a manner to allow underutilized bidders to be able to compete for the State agencys contracts; (b) conducted periodic opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to learn of the State agencys general anticipated contract needs prior to advertisement independent of a published bid solicitation and to learn about the State agencys contracting practices and requirements; (c) conducted periodic outreach to business associations representing minority and women-owned businesses to publicize the State agencys contracting opportunities; (d) used the States central certification registry or a similar dataset to identify and notify all listed minority and women-owned businesses in the relevant market of the opportunity to submit a bid for a contract subject to goals for which the respective businesses qualify; and (e) took other actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). b.  For purposes of attaining the goals set forth in this section, State agencies may establish bid criteria for contracts or portions of contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority-owned businesses or women-owned businesses, though the State agency may still award the contract to a bidder that is not a minority-owned business or women-owned business.  The goals established in subsection a. of this section shall not be required to be attained independently and may be attained through contracts awarded to businesses that qualify as minority-owned businesses or women-owned businesses and may count towards more than one goal. c.  In setting and achieving the goals set forth in this section, a State agency shall: (1) consult the findings contained within the disparity study evidencing relevant industry-specific disparities in the utilization of minority and women-owned businesses relative to their availability or conduct another disparity study and consult the findings therein; (2) implement a program that will enable the State agency to evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate goal for participation by minority and women-owned businesses; (3) consider where practicable, the severability of construction projects and other bundled contracts; (4) consider compliance with the requirements of any federal law concerning opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses which effectuates the purpose of this section.  The State agency shall determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any such law duplicate or conflict with the provisions hereof and if such duplication or conflict exists, the State agency shall waive the applicability of this section to the extent of such duplication or conflict; and (5) take any other action that the Chief determines to be appropriate in rules adopted by the State Treasurer. d.  (1) Each prime contractor shall make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals established in this section. For purposes of determining a contractors good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section, the State agency shall consider: (a) whether the contractor has advertised the opportunity to, or otherwise made  minority and women-owned business aware of the opportunity, in such event, (i) whether minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses exhibited interest in working with the contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency awarding the contract; and (ii) whether minority and women-owned businesses, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage minority and women-owned businesses prior to the State agencys bid date; (b) whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities on the contract to appropriate minority and women-owned businesses that appear in the States central contractor registry which lists businesses certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State program; (c) whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (d) whether other actions determined appropriate by the Chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), were taken. (2) Failure on the part of a contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be grounds for the rejection of bids made by that contractor on the contract for which the contractor is required to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section. 5.  Section 3 of P.L.1987, c.318 (C.5:10-21.1a) is amended to read as follows: 3.  The authority is authorized and directed to establish, prior to initiating any project on or after the effective date of this 1987 amendatory and supplementary act, small business [, minority business and women's business] set-aside contract goals and procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses [, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses], " P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.).

Bidders shall be notified of the set-aside cancellation, the reasons for the rejection and the State's intent to resolicit bids on an unrestricted basis.

(2)   The department shall develop a process for evaluating and adjusting goals to determine what adjustments are necessary to achieve participation goals. b.    Each [contracting] State agency shall annually develop, in consultation with the department, a plan for achieving its qualified business enterprise goals. (cf: P.L.2023, c.300, s.3) 20.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the State Treasurer may adopt, immediately, upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such rules and regulations as the State Treasurer deems necessary to implement the provisions of sections of P.L. , c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which rules and regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 365 days after the date of the filing. Before the expiration of the rules and regulations, the State Treasurer shall amend, adopt, or readopt the rules and regulations in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 21.  (New section) The provisions of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be severable, and if any of its provisions shall be held to be unconstitutional, the decision of the court shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this act. 22.  Section 1 of P.L.1995, c.39 (C.52:32-22.1) and section 4 of P.L.2011, c.147 (C.52:32-52) and are repealed. 23.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to contracts awarded on and after the 181st day next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act, amends the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, and repeals various sections of the statutory law. The Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act establishes a new process for determining preference in awarding State agency contracts.  State agencies are required to develop a plan for the fiscal year following the effective date of the bill and each fiscal year thereafter to encourage minority and women-owned businesses to submit proposals and encourage the awarding of contracts to those businesses.  The bill establishes contract utilization goals for all State agencies based on the New Jersey Disparity Study on the Availability and Utilization of Small, Minority, Women, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses published in January of 2024.  The State agency may adjust the percentages based on persuasive analysis that documents a statistically significant disparity between the availability and utilization of minority and women-owned businesses.  In an effort to achieve the goals, the agency may establish bid criteria for contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority and women-owned businesses. State agencies are required to make a good faith effort to attain the goals set forth in the bill.  If the agency fails to make a good faith effort, a remedial action plan will be submitted to the Chief Diversity Officer.  If it is determined by the Chief that the agency did not act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan within one year, the Chief may make the remedial action plan public to encourage implementation.  If implementation still does not occur, the Chief may require that some or all of the agencys procurement be placed under the direction and control of another agency.  Prime contractors are also required to make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals set forth in the bill.  Failure by a prime contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may result in grounds for rejection of bids made by the prime contractor. The bill amends the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses to only be applicable to small businesses by removing mentions of female and minority-owned businesses.  The bill shifts chief, office, and departmental duties from the Chief of the Office of Small Business Assistance, the Office of Small Business Assistance, and the Department of Commerce and Economic Development to the Chief Diversity Officer, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and the Department of the Treasury.  The bill changes the set-aside goals for small businesses from 15 percent to 25 percent and removes goals for minority and women-owned businesses. The bill establishes a goal that State agencies award at least 30 percent of their contracts to socially and economically disadvantaged businesses. The bill repeals the law establishing compliance calculations for contracting agencies awarding contracts to minority or women-owned businesses, P.L.1995, c.39 (C.52:32-22.1), and repeals the law establishing the goal of giving due consideration to veteran-owned businesses and the requirement that strategies be identified to expand the number of veteran-owned businesses interested in and eligible to benefit from State procurement, P.L.2011, c.147 (C.52:32-52).
