Under the bill, if the Legislature does not act to pass a concurrent resolution, the rules would expire and the agency would be prohibited from readopting the rules for a period of five years. Under the bill, the change in the chapter expiration date from seven years to five years and the requirement for legislative approval for readoption thereafter would apply to all rules adopted on or after the date of enactment of the bill into law. The bill provides that the Governor may, upon the request of an agency head, within five days after the passage of a concurrent resolution by both Houses of the Legislature, restore the effectiveness of an expired rule as of its expiration date, for a period to be specified by the Governor, in order to effect the readoption of the rule.
