STATEMENT The bill requires a service provider doing business in this State to allow a service recipient to terminate the service contract, as provided in the bill, without incurring an early termination fee.  Unless otherwise waived by the service provider, the bill requires a service recipient to provide the service provider with no less than 45 days notice prior to the contract termination or cancellation.  However, if a physicians order requires immediate relocation to a long-term care facility, this notice requirement would be waived, and the contract may be terminated within 48 hours.  The service provider is to provide a standard termination to the service recipient upon request, which the service recipient and a physician are to utilize when requesting contract termination or cancellation from the service provider. If a service recipient is unable to submit the standard termination form and a representative of the recipient is requesting contract termination or cancellation, the representative is to submit to the service provider the standard termination form and a copy of the power of attorney, conservatorship, or guardianship documents verifying the representatives authority.
