(cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.10) 6.    (New section) a. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7 and 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-66 and C.52:27H-80), for an enterprise zone designated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (10) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1995, c.382 (C.52:27H-66.1), the receipts of all retail sales of goods not exempted from the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-80) from a seller who is certified by the director pursuant to that section, shall be exempt to the extent of 50 percent of the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) but shall be collected in a manner consistent with that act.  The revenues derived from the sales tax collected from those retail sales shall be divided as follows: (1) for the first five years of the designation as an enterprise zone, the General Fund of the State of New Jersey shall receive zero percent; and the remaining 100 percent shall be deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account; and (2) for the second and final five years of the designation as an enterprise zone, the General Fund of the State of New Jersey shall receive 70 percent; and the remaining 30 percent shall be deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88), all of the revenues deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account shall be used by the qualifying municipality for the purpose of providing local property tax relief. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Atlantic City Urban Enterprise Zone and Property Tax Relief Act, authorizes the creation of an urban enterprise zone (zone) in the city of Atlantic City for a one-time term of 10 years.  The zone authorized under this bill would be the 33rd zone created under the Urban Enterprise Zone program, which was first authorized in 1983.  The additional zone authorized pursuant to this bill is required to be designated within 90 days of the date of the submittal of an application and zone development plan by the municipality.  Qualifying retail businesses in the additional zone to be designated pursuant to the criteria for priority consideration set forth in the bill would be entitled to collect sales and use tax reduced to the extent of 50 percent of the sales and use tax (SUT).  A business operating as a casino is not eligible for the benefits of an eligible business under the UEZ program but a business operating on casino property not owned by a casino business may be eligible if it otherwise meets the criteria for business eligibility.  During the first five years, all of the SUT revenues collected are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City and during the second final five years, 66.5 percent of the SUT revenues collected are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City.  These revenues are to be used by Atlantic City to provide local property tax relief. This bill is meant to address the negative economic conditions experienced by Atlantic City over the past several years as the city transitions from a casino gaming destination to a general-interest tourist destination.

Any individual, including an individual who is not directly employed by a qualifying municipality, with the authority to administer, allocate or approve the use of zone assistance funds is subject to the "Local Government Ethics Law," P.L.1991, c.29 (C.40A:9-22.1 et seq.), unless the individual is a State employee or a special State officer. b.    [The] Except as provided in section 6 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the enterprise zone assistance fund shall be used for the purpose of assisting qualifying municipalities in which enterprise zones are designated in undertaking economic development projects in designated enterprise zones by funding qualified assistance fund expenses.  However, a qualifying municipality shall not appropriate or expend more than 25 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for public safety purposes, as described pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62) or more than 10 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for administrative expenses. c.     The governing body of a qualifying municipality in which an enterprise zone is designated and the zone development corporation created or designated by the municipality for that enterprise zone may, by resolution jointly adopted after public hearing, propose to undertake an economic development project in the enterprise zone, and to fund that project from moneys deposited in the enterprise zone assistance fund and credited to the account maintained by the State Treasurer for the enterprise zone. The proposal so adopted shall set forth a plan for the project and shall include: (1)   A description of the proposed project; (2)   An estimate of the total project costs, and an estimate of the amounts of funding necessary annually from the enterprise zone account; (3)   A statement of any other revenue sources to be used to finance the project; (4)   A statement of the time necessary to complete the project; (5)   A statement of the manner in which the proposed project furthers the municipality's policy and intentions for addressing economic development in the enterprise zone as set forth in the zone development plan approved by the authority; and (6)   A description of the financial and programmatic controls and reporting mechanisms to be used to guarantee that the funds will be spent in accordance with the plan and that the project will accomplish its purpose. As used in this section, "project" means an activity that satisfies the requirements of a qualified assistance fund expense, as that term is defined in subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62), and which will lead to the creation of new jobs and increased economic activity within the zone. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) h.    At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not encumbered a portion of its allocation, such amount may be carried forward to the next State fiscal year and the State fiscal year thereafter.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any of those unencumbered funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. i.     At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not expended or otherwise committed a portion of its encumbered funds, then such amount may be carried forward to the next three succeeding State fiscal years.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any unexpended funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. j.     At the end of a State fiscal year, the Department of Community Affairs shall review an enterprise zone's expenditures of funds received from the zone assistance fund.  If the department finds that an enterprise zone expended such funds in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.) and P.L.2021, c.197, then the enterprise zone shall repay such funds to the department through the forfeiture of future zone assistance fund disbursements.  The department shall withhold future funding from the enterprise zone until the enterprise zone enters into and complies with a corrective action plan developed by the department. k.    If in a State fiscal year the amount allocated to the enterprise zone assistance fund is less than the amount required to be allocated pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) and paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the Legislature shall appropriate to the enterprise zone assistance fund the amount that was not allocated in such State fiscal year in a succeeding State fiscal year along with the funds required to be allocated in that State fiscal year. (cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.10) 6.    (New section) a. Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 7 and 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-66 and C.52:27H-80), for an enterprise zone designated pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (10) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1995, c.382 (C.52:27H-66.1), the receipts of all retail sales of goods not exempted from the provisions of section 21 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-80) from a seller who is certified by the director pursuant to that section, shall be exempt to the extent of 50 percent of the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) but shall be collected in a manner consistent with that act.  The revenues derived from the sales tax collected from those retail sales shall be divided as follows: (1) for the first five years of the designation as an enterprise zone, the General Fund of the State of New Jersey shall receive zero percent; and the remaining 100 percent shall be deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account; and (2) for the second and final five years of the designation as an enterprise zone, the General Fund of the State of New Jersey shall receive 70 percent; and the remaining 30 percent shall be deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88), all of the revenues deposited into the separate account maintained within the enterprise zone assistance fund for the applicable qualifying municipalitys enterprise zone trust fund account shall be used by the qualifying municipality for the purpose of providing local property tax relief. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Atlantic City Urban Enterprise Zone and Property Tax Relief Act, authorizes the creation of an urban enterprise zone (zone) in the city of Atlantic City for a one-time term of 10 years.  The zone authorized under this bill would be the 33rd zone created under the Urban Enterprise Zone program, which was first authorized in 1983.  The additional zone authorized pursuant to this bill is required to be designated within 90 days of the date of the submittal of an application and zone development plan by the municipality.  Qualifying retail businesses in the additional zone to be designated pursuant to the criteria for priority consideration set forth in the bill would be entitled to collect sales and use tax reduced to the extent of 50 percent of the sales and use tax (SUT).  A business operating as a casino is not eligible for the benefits of an eligible business under the UEZ program but a business operating on casino property not owned by a casino business may be eligible if it otherwise meets the criteria for business eligibility.  During the first five years, all of the SUT revenues collected are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City and during the second final five years, 66.5 percent of the SUT revenues collected are to be appropriated for use by Atlantic City.  These revenues are to be used by Atlantic City to provide local property tax relief. This bill is meant to address the negative economic conditions experienced by Atlantic City over the past several years as the city transitions from a casino gaming destination to a general-interest tourist destination.
