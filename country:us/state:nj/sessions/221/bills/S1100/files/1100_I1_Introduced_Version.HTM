S1100 SENATE, No. 1100 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BRITNEE N. TIMBERLAKE District 34 (Essex) SYNOPSIS Creates New Jersey Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the employment rights of domestic workers and amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Domestic workers provide valuable services in industries such as in-home child care, house cleaning, home care, cooking, gardening, and other household occupations. b.    The labor domestic workers provide is an important contribution to the States economy and prosperity, including but not limited to, by providing support services that enable other individuals to participate in the workforce. c.     Many domestic workers are women, immigrants, and persons of color who work in or about private homes, isolated from other workers. d.    Since 2007, the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) has advocated for respect for domestic workers by including them in national, State, and local labor protection laws.  NDWA. In September 2020, NDWA affiliates, Adhikaar, Casa Freehold, New Labor and Wind of the Spirit, in collaboration with the Center for Women at Work at Rutgers University, released a report which found low pay, lack of benefits, and rampant wage theft occurs throughout the domestic worker industry, and that there is a lack of enforcement regarding existing rights of domestic workers. e.     At least 10 other states and two cities have enacted legislation to provide rights, benefits, and protections for domestic workers. f.     The Legislature therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the State of New Jersey and its residents to provide rights, benefits, and protections to the countless domestic workers providing valuable services throughout the State. 2.    (New section)  As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Casual work means work that is: (1)   irregular, uncertain, or incidental in nature and duration; and (2)   different in nature from the type of paid work in which the worker is customarily engaged. Domestic services means services of a household nature and performed by an individual in or about a private home on a permanent or temporary basis, and includes services performed by a domestic worker.

(2)   "Average annual payroll" means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no "annual payroll" because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the "average annual payroll" in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an "annual payroll" in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his "average annual payroll" determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that "average annual payroll" solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employer's contribution rate is computed.

S1100 SENATE, No. 1100 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BRITNEE N. TIMBERLAKE District 34 (Essex) SYNOPSIS Creates New Jersey Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the employment rights of domestic workers and amending and supplementing various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Domestic workers provide valuable services in industries such as in-home child care, house cleaning, home care, cooking, gardening, and other household occupations. b.    The labor domestic workers provide is an important contribution to the States economy and prosperity, including but not limited to, by providing support services that enable other individuals to participate in the workforce. c.     Many domestic workers are women, immigrants, and persons of color who work in or about private homes, isolated from other workers. d.    Since 2007, the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) has advocated for respect for domestic workers by including them in national, State, and local labor protection laws.  NDWA. In September 2020, NDWA affiliates, Adhikaar, Casa Freehold, New Labor and Wind of the Spirit, in collaboration with the Center for Women at Work at Rutgers University, released a report which found low pay, lack of benefits, and rampant wage theft occurs throughout the domestic worker industry, and that there is a lack of enforcement regarding existing rights of domestic workers. e.     At least 10 other states and two cities have enacted legislation to provide rights, benefits, and protections for domestic workers. f.     The Legislature therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the State of New Jersey and its residents to provide rights, benefits, and protections to the countless domestic workers providing valuable services throughout the State. 2.    (New section)  As used in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Casual work means work that is: (1)   irregular, uncertain, or incidental in nature and duration; and (2)   different in nature from the type of paid work in which the worker is customarily engaged. Domestic services means services of a household nature and performed by an individual in or about a private home on a permanent or temporary basis, and includes services performed by a domestic worker.

(2)   "Average annual payroll" means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no "annual payroll" because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the "average annual payroll" in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an "annual payroll" in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his "average annual payroll" determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that "average annual payroll" solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employer's contribution rate is computed.

(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  However, in the case of temporary or seasonal employment that ended before the close of the 90 calendar day period, the presumption also applies if the hiring entity fails to rehire a former domestic worker at the next opportunity for work in the same position. The hiring entity may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that the adverse action would have been taken in the absence of such protected activity. h.    Proof of retaliation under P.L.    , c.    (C.     et seq.) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be sufficient upon a showing that the hiring entity or any other person has taken an adverse action against a person and the persons exercise or rights protected in P.L.    , c.    (C.        et seq.)
