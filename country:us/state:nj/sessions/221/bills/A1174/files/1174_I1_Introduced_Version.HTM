within the municipality.  The registry is to include the following information
for each abandoned property: (1) the tax block and lot number; (2) the street
address; (3) the owner or owners of the property; (4) the person or entity
responsible for rehabilitating the property; and (5) the rehabilitation
efforts, if any, completed on the property.  The registry would be distinct
from the abandoned property list currently maintained by certain municipalities,
and the inclusion of a property on the registry would not confer any additional
powers to the municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, each
municipality is required to annually submit its abandoned property registry to
the Division of Local Government Services in the DCA.  The division would be
required to make available on its Internet website a Statewide database of all
abandoned properties located in the State.  The database is to include the
information contained in each municipal registry submitted to the division. 
The database also would be searchable by municipality and by the type of entity
owning each abandoned property, including financial institutions,
municipalities, private residents, and other public or private entities as
deemed appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires each
municipality to deliver, on a quarterly basis, a notice to the owner of each
abandoned property located in the municipality in order to solicit information
concerning the status of any rehabilitation efforts.  The owner of the property
is required to respond by documenting any rehabilitation efforts completed on
the property within the previous 12 month period.  If the owner of an abandoned
property has designated an agent to manage the property, the notice may be
delivered to that agent, who may also respond on behalf of the property owner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
authorizes a municipality to hold a special tax sale concerning any abandoned
property pursuant to the Abandoned Properties Rehabilitation Act, if: (1) the
property is eligible for tax sale pursuant to R.S.54:5-19; and (2) the owner of
the property fails to verify the receipt of the notice, the owner of the
property fails to respond within 30 days of the date of receipt, or the
response is inaccurate or incomplete.  However, an abandoned property would not
be eligible for a special tax sale if the owner of the property adequately
responds to the notice prior to the date of the special tax sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order defray the costs
associated with implementing this bill, municipalities would be authorized to
impose and collect an annual fee on the owner of each abandoned property.  The
unpaid fees would constitute a lien on the property and would be collected in
the same manner as property taxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that a
municipality will not receive any of the following forms of municipal aid
during any fiscal year in which it fails to comply with the provisions of the
bill: Energy Tax </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid;
Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid; Transitional Aid to Localities,
or any successor discretionary aid program for municipalities in fiscal
distress.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>     </i>Given the deleterious
effects of abandoned properties on neighboring communities, municipalities
currently possess broad powers to rehabilitate abandoned properties.  It is the
intent of the sponsor to encourage accountability amongst municipalities and
the owners of abandoned properties as it relates to the rehabilitation of those
properties.  </p>
