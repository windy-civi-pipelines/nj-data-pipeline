(cf: P.L.1999, c.168, s.2) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52:27D-118.42a) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  [The]  Except as otherwise provided in subsection c. of this section, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs shall determine conditions, requirements, orders, and oversight for the receipt of any amount of grants, loans, or any combination thereof, provided to any municipality through the Transitional Aid to Localities program or any successor discretionary aid programs for municipalities in fiscal distress. Conditions, requirements, or orders deemed necessary by the director may include, but not be limited to, the implementation of government, administrative, and operational efficiency and oversight measures necessary for the fiscal recovery of the municipality, including but not limited to requiring approval by the director of personnel actions, professional services and related contracts, payment in lieu of tax agreements, acceptance of grants from State, federal or other organizations, and the creation of new or expanded public services. b.    An additional amount not to exceed one percent of the amount appropriated in any State Fiscal Year beginning on or after July 1, 2012 for the Transitional Aid to Localities program or any successor discretionary aid programs for municipalities in fiscal distress shall be appropriated for administrative costs of that program, and for administrative costs associated with the oversight of any municipalities under State supervision pursuant to Article 4 of the "Local Government Supervision Act (1947)," P.L.1947, c.151 (C.52:27BB-54 et seq.), subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the Department of the Treasury. c.     A municipality shall not be awarded aid through the Transitional Aid to Localities program, or any successor discretionary aid programs for municipalities in fiscal distress, during any fiscal year in which the municipality does not comply with the provisions of section 2 or section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2011, c.144, s.1) 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires municipalities to take certain actions relating to abandoned properties. Specifically, municipalities would be required to maintain a registry of all abandoned properties and contact the owner of each abandoned property concerning the status of rehabilitation efforts prior to receiving municipal aid.  The bill also requires the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to publish a Statewide database of all abandoned properties. This bill requires every municipality to maintain a registry of all abandoned properties located within the municipality.  The registry is to include the following information for each abandoned property: (1) the tax block and lot number; (2) the street address; (3) the owner or owners of the property; (4) the person or entity responsible for rehabilitating the property; and (5) the rehabilitation efforts, if any, completed on the property.  The registry would be distinct from the abandoned property list currently maintained by certain municipalities, and the inclusion of a property on the registry would not confer any additional powers to the municipality. Under the bill, each municipality is required to annually submit its abandoned property registry to the Division of Local Government Services in the DCA.  The division would be required to make available on its Internet website a Statewide database of all abandoned properties located in the State.  The database is to include the information contained in each municipal registry submitted to the division. The database also would be searchable by municipality and by the type of entity owning each abandoned property, including financial institutions, municipalities, private residents, and other public or private entities as deemed appropriate. The bill also requires each municipality to deliver, on a quarterly basis, a notice to the owner of each abandoned property located in the municipality in order to solicit information concerning the status of any rehabilitation efforts.  The owner of the property is required to respond by documenting any rehabilitation efforts completed on the property within the previous 12 month period.  If the owner of an abandoned property has designated an agent to manage the property, the notice may be delivered to that agent, who may also respond on behalf of the property owner. In addition, the bill authorizes a municipality to hold a special tax sale concerning any abandoned property pursuant to the Abandoned Properties Rehabilitation Act, if: (1) the property is eligible for tax sale pursuant to R.S.54:5-19; and (2) the owner of the property fails to verify the receipt of the notice, the owner of the property fails to respond within 30 days of the date of receipt, or the response is inaccurate or incomplete.  However, an abandoned property would not be eligible for a special tax sale if the owner of the property adequately responds to the notice prior to the date of the special tax sale. In order defray the costs associated with implementing this bill, municipalities would be authorized to impose and collect an annual fee on the owner of each abandoned property.  The unpaid fees would constitute a lien on the property and would be collected in the same manner as property taxes. The bill also provides that a municipality will not receive any of the following forms of municipal aid during any fiscal year in which it fails to comply with the provisions of the bill: Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid; Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid; Transitional Aid to Localities, or any successor discretionary aid program for municipalities in fiscal distress. Given the deleterious effects of abandoned properties on neighboring communities, municipalities currently possess broad powers to rehabilitate abandoned properties.  It is the intent of the sponsor to encourage accountability amongst municipalities and the owners of abandoned properties as it relates to the rehabilitation of those properties.

(cf: P.L.2011, c.144, s.1) 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the sixth month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires municipalities to take certain actions relating to abandoned properties. Specifically, municipalities would be required to maintain a registry of all abandoned properties and contact the owner of each abandoned property concerning the status of rehabilitation efforts prior to receiving municipal aid.  The bill also requires the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) to publish a Statewide database of all abandoned properties. This bill requires every municipality to maintain a registry of all abandoned properties located within the municipality.  The registry is to include the following information for each abandoned property: (1) the tax block and lot number; (2) the street address; (3) the owner or owners of the property; (4) the person or entity responsible for rehabilitating the property; and (5) the rehabilitation efforts, if any, completed on the property.  The registry would be distinct from the abandoned property list currently maintained by certain municipalities, and the inclusion of a property on the registry would not confer any additional powers to the municipality. Under the bill, each municipality is required to annually submit its abandoned property registry to the Division of Local Government Services in the DCA.  The division would be required to make available on its Internet website a Statewide database of all abandoned properties located in the State.  The database is to include the information contained in each municipal registry submitted to the division. The database also would be searchable by municipality and by the type of entity owning each abandoned property, including financial institutions, municipalities, private residents, and other public or private entities as deemed appropriate. The bill also requires each municipality to deliver, on a quarterly basis, a notice to the owner of each abandoned property located in the municipality in order to solicit information concerning the status of any rehabilitation efforts.  The owner of the property is required to respond by documenting any rehabilitation efforts completed on the property within the previous 12 month period.  If the owner of an abandoned property has designated an agent to manage the property, the notice may be delivered to that agent, who may also respond on behalf of the property owner. In addition, the bill authorizes a municipality to hold a special tax sale concerning any abandoned property pursuant to the Abandoned Properties Rehabilitation Act, if: (1) the property is eligible for tax sale pursuant to R.S.54:5-19; and (2) the owner of the property fails to verify the receipt of the notice, the owner of the property fails to respond within 30 days of the date of receipt, or the response is inaccurate or incomplete.  However, an abandoned property would not be eligible for a special tax sale if the owner of the property adequately responds to the notice prior to the date of the special tax sale. In order defray the costs associated with implementing this bill, municipalities would be authorized to impose and collect an annual fee on the owner of each abandoned property.  The unpaid fees would constitute a lien on the property and would be collected in the same manner as property taxes. The bill also provides that a municipality will not receive any of the following forms of municipal aid during any fiscal year in which it fails to comply with the provisions of the bill: Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid; Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid; Transitional Aid to Localities, or any successor discretionary aid program for municipalities in fiscal distress. Given the deleterious effects of abandoned properties on neighboring communities, municipalities currently possess broad powers to rehabilitate abandoned properties.  It is the intent of the sponsor to encourage accountability amongst municipalities and the owners of abandoned properties as it relates to the rehabilitation of those properties.
