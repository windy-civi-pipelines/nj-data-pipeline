The bill provides that vacancies in task force membership would be filled in the same manner as the original appointments.  The members of the task force would serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for traveling and other miscellaneous expenses.  The bill directs the Commissioner of Community Affairs to provide professional and clerical staff to the task force as necessary. The bill directs the task force to complete its first meeting, and appoint a chairperson, within 60 days of enactment, and present a report of its findings and recommendations to the Governor and Legislature by the first day of the sixteenth month next following its organization.  The task force would dissolve following the presentation of the report.
