STATEMENT This bill requires the State Board of Education to establish a pathway for interstate reciprocity for a certificate of eligibility (CE) and certificate of eligibility with advanced standing (CEAS) for a teacher who holds the equivalent of a valid certificate in another state. Current regulations provide a pathway for reciprocity for a CEAS.  Additionally, a pilot program that permits certain individuals to receive reciprocity for a CE is ongoing.  Pursuant to N.J.A.C.6A:9B-8.8, in order to obtain reciprocity for a CEAS, an individual is required to (1) hold a valid CEAS issued by another state in a subject area or grade level also offered by the New Jersey Department of Education, following, with limited exception, the completion of a CEAS educator preparation program that includes clinical practice and endorsement in a subject that is also issued in New Jersey; (2) pass a subject-matter test to receive the out-of-state endorsement or pass the appropriate New Jersey subject matter test; and (3) pass a performance assessment that is approved by the state in which the certificate was issued, with limited exceptions.  Out-of-state candidates for a CEAS who were not required to pass a state-approved performance assessment as part of their educator preparation program are to be issued a CE rather than a CEAS. Under the Alternate Route Interstate Reciprocity Pilot Program, which is a five-year pilot program, in order for an individual to receive an instructional CE the individual is required to (1) enroll in a CE educator preparation program that participates in the pilot program; (2) hold an equivalent, valid CE or provisional instructional certificate issued by another state; (3) pass a subject-matter test to receive an out-of-state endorsement or the appropriate New Jersey subject-matter test; (3) have at least one year of effective teaching experience as documented by a letter from the candidates former supervisor, principal, or employing school districts human resource officer; and (5) demonstrate good standing during previous teaching experience under an out-of-state certificate. In order to be eligible for a CE or CEAS under the provisions of the bill, an individual is required to: (1) hold a valid and current CE or a CEAS, as applicable, or its equivalent and currently-issued New Jersey grade level or subject endorsement; (2) have held employment as a public school teacher in the state in which the teacher holds the applicable certificate during one of the last two school years; (3) submit an application to the State Board of Examiners that includes two letters of recommendation; (4) pass a criminal history record check; (5) comply with New Jerseys residency requirement for certain public employees, and (6) any other requirement the State Board of Education deems necessary. The bill also prohibits the State Board of Education from requiring a person eligible for a CE or a CEAS pursuant to the bill to complete a performance-based assessment or test of basic reading, writing, and mathematics skills as a condition of eligibility for a certificate.
