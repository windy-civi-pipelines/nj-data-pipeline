The bill would  require local housing authorities in the State that administer funding through the federal section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program to also implement the Housing Choice Voucher Homeownership Program.  Currently, local housing authorities are permitted, but not required, to implement this program. The bill would take effect on the first day of the sixth month following enactment in order to provide DCA and housing authorities time to prepare to implement the bills requirements.
