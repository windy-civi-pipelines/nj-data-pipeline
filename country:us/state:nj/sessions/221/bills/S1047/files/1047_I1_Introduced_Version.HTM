Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The practice of steering by a pharmacy benefits manager represents a conflict of interest; b.    These practices have resulted in harm, including increasing drug prices, overcharging covered persons and carriers, restricting or underpaying covered persons choice of pharmacies and fragmenting and creating barriers to care, particularly in rural New Jersey and for patients battling life-threatening illnesses and chronic diseases; and c.     Imposing a surcharge on pharmacy benefits managers that engage in steering in this State may encourage carriers to use pharmacy benefits managers committed to refraining from steering practices. 2.    As used in this act: Commissioner means the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. Credentialing means the process of assessing and validating the qualifications of a health care provider including, but not limited to, an evaluation of licensure status, education, training, experience, competence and professional judgement. Department means the Department of Banking and Insurance. Health care provider" means an individual, which, acting within the scope of its licensure or certification, provides health care services, and includes, but is not limited to: a physician, dentist, nurse, pharmacist or other health care professional and whose professional practice is regulated pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. Health care provider shall also mean a hospital or other health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.) Medicaid means the program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.). National average drug acquisition cost means the monthly survey of retail pharmacies conducted by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine average acquisition cost for Medicaid covered outpatient drugs. Steering means a practice employed by a pharmacy benefit manager or health carrier that channels a prescription to an affiliated pharmacy, or pharmacy in which a pharmacy benefits manager or carrier has an ownership interest, and includes but is not limited to retail, mail-order, or specialty pharmacies. 3.    A pharmacy benefits manager shall: a.     not require a covered person to use a mail-order pharmaceutical distributor, including a mail-order pharmacy; b.    offer a health benefits plan the option of charging such health plan the same price for a prescription drug as it pays a pharmacy for the prescription drug; provided, however, that a pharmacy benefits manager shall charge a health benefits plan, the same price for a prescription drug as it pays a pharmacy for the prescription drug; c.     report in the aggregate to a health benefits plan the difference between the amount a pharmacy benefits manager reimbursed a pharmacy and the amount a pharmacy benefits manager charged a health benefits plan; and d.    when calculating a covered person's contribution to any out-of-pocket maximum, deductible, or copayment responsibility, include any amount paid by the covered person or paid on his or her behalf through a third-party payment, financial assistance, discount, or product voucher for a prescription drug that does not have a generic equivalent or that has a generic equivalent but was obtained through prior authorization, a step therapy protocol, or the carriers exceptions and appeals process.

A pharmacy benefits manager that engages in the practice of steering or imposing point-of-sale fees or retroactive fees shall be subject to a surcharge payable to the State of 10 percent on the aggregate dollar amount it reimbursed pharmacies in the previous  calendar year for prescription drugs. b     Any person operating a health benefits plan and licensed under this title whose contracted pharmacy benefits manager engages in the practice of steering in connection with its health benefits plans shall be subject to a surcharge payable to the State of 10 percent on the aggregate dollar amount its pharmacy benefits manager reimbursed pharmacies on its behalf in the previous calendar year for prescription drugs. c.     On March 1 of each year, a pharmacy benefits manager or any other person operating a health benefits plan that utilizes a contracted pharmacy benefits manager shall provide a letter to the commissioner attesting as to whether or not, in the previous calendar year, it engaged in the practice of steering.

The department shall have access to all confidential data collected by the Commissioner for audit purposes. d.    On April 1 of each year, a pharmacy benefits manager or other person operating a health benefits plan and licensed under this title shall pay into the general fund of the State treasury the surcharge owed, if any, as contained in the report submitted pursuant to subsection c. of this section. e.     Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the practice of steering where otherwise prohibited by law. 6.    A carrier or pharmacy benefits manager shall not require satisfaction of pharmacy accreditation standards or recertification requirements in order to participate in a network which is inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the federal and State requirements for a pharmacy in this State. 7.    a. A carrier or pharmacy benefits manager shall issue a report every four months, which shall be provided to the commissioner and published, for no less than 24 months, by the pharmacy benefits manager on a website available to the public, of all drugs appearing on the national average drug acquisition cost list reimbursed 10 percent above or below the national average drug acquisition cost, as well as all drugs reimbursed 10 percent or above the national average drug acquisition cost. b.    For each drug in the report, a carrier or pharmacy benefits manager shall include: (1)   the month the drug was dispensed; (2)   the quantity of the drug dispensed; (3)   the amount the pharmacy was reimbursed per unit or dosage; (4)   whether the dispensing pharmacy was an affiliate of the pharmacy benefits manager; (5)   whether the drug was dispensed pursuant to a State or local government health benefits plan; and (6)   the average national average drug acquisition cost for the month the drug was dispensed. 8.    a.  No pharmacy benefits manager shall engage in the practice of medicine, except as otherwise provided in subsection b. of this section. b.    Any physician employed by or contracted with a pharmacy benefits manager that is advising on or making determinations specific to a covered person in connection with a prior authorization or step therapy appeal or determination review shall: (1)   have actively seen patients within the past five years; and (2)   have practiced in the same specialty area for which they are providing advisement within the past five years; c.     For contracts and amendments entered into with a pharmacy benefits manager on and after the effective date of P.L.    , c.
