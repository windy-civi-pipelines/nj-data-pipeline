utilizing the criteria set forth herein.  In addition to any civil
administrative penalty assessed under this subsection and notwithstanding the
$25,000 maximum penalty set forth above, the commissioner may assess any economic
benefits from the violation gained by the violator.  Prior to assessment of a
penalty under this subsection, the owner or operator of the high hazard train
committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal
service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall: include a
reference to the section of the statute or regulation violated; recite the

the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a

commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine
specified in the notice. If a hearing is not requested, the notice shall become
a final order after the expiration of the 35 calendar day period.  Payment of
the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a
