CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning notification of real property assessment, designated as the Property Assessment Appeal Transparency Act, and amending P.L.1991, c.75. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 32 of P.L.1991, c.75 (C.54:4-38.1) is amended to read as follows: 32.  a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, every assessor, prior to February 1, shall notify by mail each taxpayer of the current assessment and preceding year's taxes.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.136, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Property Assessment Appeal Transparency Act, would require that the annual property assessment notice required to be mailed to each taxpayer, pursuant to section 32 of P.L.1991, c.75 (C.54:4-38.1), contain information explaining the impact of the assessed value of a parcel of real property on the property tax bill for that parcel of real property. Under current law, this annual notice is only required by statute to contain the current years assessment and preceding years property taxes.  A notification of a change of assessment, also required under the statute, only requires information about the current and prior assessments on the property.  Both notices must also contain information instructing taxpayers on how to appeal their assessment.  However, no information is currently required in either case about the effect of a propertys assessed value on the property taxes due and owing on the property. This lack of information leads to confusion on the part of many property owners who do not understand that the amount of their property tax bill is directly related to the propertys assessed value. In order to provide this information to taxpayers, this bill would require that the notice of assessment and notice of change of assessment also contain this statement: This notice is to inform you of the assessment on your real property for the current tax year.  This assessment will be used to calculate your property tax bill.  If you disagree with the assessed value of your real property, you should file an appeal of this assessment with your county board of taxation.  If the assessed value exceeds $1,000,000, you may appeal to your county board of taxation or directly to the Tax Court. This statement would provide property taxpayers with greater knowledge and understanding about the effect of their propertys assessed value on their property taxes, and would also effectuate transparency in how property taxes are calculated.
