S4255 SENATE, No. 4255 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 3, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Modifies provisions of Cultural Arts Incentives Program; eliminates Community-Anchored Development Program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning State economic development policy, amending various parts of the statutory law, and repealing sections 43 through 53 of P.L.2020, c.156. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-384) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The New Jersey Economic Development Authority can effectively utilize cultural arts institution facilities as catalysts for broad economic development in targeted communities.  Under the legislation, facilities engaged in the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State are provided with the opportunity to facilitate targeted development, utilizing proceeds from the sale of State tax credits.  This approach harnesses the ability of cultural arts institution facilities to attract visitors and businesses to the State by leveraging the incalculable economic and cultural benefits of building and supporting world class cultural arts institutions. b.    Projects involving the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility are inherently beneficial to the State because they provide vital contributions to the communities in which they are located, and together the arts community provides immeasurable economic and cultural benefits to the State. c.     [Through a competitive application process, a cultural arts institution will make its case for an amount of tax credits necessary for a project to be able to establish occupancy costs at a competitive level.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The Legislature declares that two principal objectives underscore the policy approach of this legislation: first, that providing spaces for arts and culture to flourish will result in thriving communities; and second, the State must help to provide these spaces through an incentives program that better reflects the economics of arts and culture facilities and that the current suite of real estate programs cannot succeed in this endeavor. (cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-385) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-383 et al.): "Affiliate" means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by a cultural arts institution.  Control exists in all cases in which the entity is a member of a controlled group of corporations as defined pursuant to section 1563 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1563) or the entity is an organization in a group of organizations under common control that is subject to the regulations applicable to organizations pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.414).  A cultural arts institution may establish by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the authority, that control exists in situations involving lesser percentages of ownership if the cultural arts institution shall have control, at a minimum, of all aspects of compliance with this program.  An affiliate of a cultural arts institution may contribute to the project cost and may satisfy the requirement for site control during construction and the eligibility period, but in no event shall the tax credit certificate be issued to any affiliate.

STATEMENT This bill expands eligibility under the Cultural Arts Incentives Program (program), authorizes the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority) to accept applications on a rolling basis, and revises certain provisions concerning tax credits awarded under the program. Applicant Eligibility Under current law, certain entities that qualify as a cultural arts institution may apply for tax credits to finance the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility under the program.  Among other requirements, to be eligible for tax credits, a cultural arts institution is required to: (1) have the primary mission and specific policy goal of cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State; (2) operate and maintain the cultural arts institution facility; and (3) own or lease space in the cultural arts institution facility. This bill amends current law to provide an exception to the requirement that a cultural arts institution have the primary mission and specific policy goal of cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State.  Under the bill, an entity may qualify as a cultural arts institution so long as any part of the entitys mission and specific policy goals addresses the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State.  The bill also expands the scope of cultural arts institutions to include the National Park Service, as well as any developer that has a partnership agreement with an entity that qualifies as a cultural arts institution. The bill also amends current law to provide an exception to the requirements that a cultural arts institution operate and maintain, and either own or lease space in, the cultural arts institution facility.  Under the bill, these requirements do not apply if the cultural arts institution facility is to be operated by the National Park Service or a developer that has a partnership agreement with the cultural arts institution. Additionally, the bill amends the definition of cultural arts institution facility under current law to include, without limitation, an aquarium, botanical society, historical society, library, museum, gallery, performing arts center, national historical park, or any related facility that is principally for the support and benefit of any of the foregoing. Operating Reserve This bill removes a provision of current law that authorizes the authority to award to certain cultural arts institutions, in addition to the tax credit award otherwise provided for under the program, a tax credit valued at up to 100 percent of an operating reserve, as determined by the authority.  Current law defines an operating reserve to mean an unrestricted fund balance set aside to stabilize a nonprofits finances to mitigate against unexpected events, losses of income, and large unbudgeted expenses. Construction Prior to Application Date Under current law, an applicant is required to demonstrate that construction has not commenced at the site of the cultural arts project prior to submitting an application, unless the authority determines that the cultural arts project would not be completed without an award of tax credits under the program. This bill amends this requirement to permit some construction prior to the submission of an application, provided that the construction activities are limited to general maintenance, necessary repairs, demolition, environmental assessment, environmental investigation, and environmental remediation.  The bill also amends the definition of project cost to exclude costs incurred for construction activities prior to the date of a cultural arts institutions application under the program. Application Process Current law requires the authority to implement a competitive application process for the program.  Instead, this bill requires the authority to conduct a review of applications on a rolling basis, unless the authority determines that demand is likely to exceed available tax credits, at which time the authority may instead implement a competitive application process whereby the authority is required to evaluate all applications submitted by a date certain as if all were submitted on that date. Use of Transferred Tax Credits Under current law, the transferee to whom a tax credit certificate is transferred under the program may carry forward all or part of the tax credit amount in any of the next five successive tax periods. This bill amends this provision to permit a transferee to use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, in the tax period in which it was issued, or in any of the next three successive tax periods.  Under the bill, the transferee may first use the credit against tax liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or in a succeeding tax period, as authorized in the bill, without the need to amend the tax return for the tax period for which the credit was issued, subject to the provisions of this section.  The transferee may carry forward an unused credit for use in any of the next five successive tax periods, and the unused credit expires thereafter. Repeal of New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Act Under current law, a total of $1.2 billion tax credits may be awarded in total under the program and the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program.  The authority is scheduled to begin accepting applications under the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program in 2026. This bill repeals the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Act that established the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program.

S4255 SENATE, No. 4255 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 3, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  BENJIE E. WIMBERLY District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Modifies provisions of Cultural Arts Incentives Program; eliminates Community-Anchored Development Program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning State economic development policy, amending various parts of the statutory law, and repealing sections 43 through 53 of P.L.2020, c.156. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-384) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The New Jersey Economic Development Authority can effectively utilize cultural arts institution facilities as catalysts for broad economic development in targeted communities.  Under the legislation, facilities engaged in the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State are provided with the opportunity to facilitate targeted development, utilizing proceeds from the sale of State tax credits.  This approach harnesses the ability of cultural arts institution facilities to attract visitors and businesses to the State by leveraging the incalculable economic and cultural benefits of building and supporting world class cultural arts institutions. b.    Projects involving the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility are inherently beneficial to the State because they provide vital contributions to the communities in which they are located, and together the arts community provides immeasurable economic and cultural benefits to the State. c.     [Through a competitive application process, a cultural arts institution will make its case for an amount of tax credits necessary for a project to be able to establish occupancy costs at a competitive level.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The Legislature declares that two principal objectives underscore the policy approach of this legislation: first, that providing spaces for arts and culture to flourish will result in thriving communities; and second, the State must help to provide these spaces through an incentives program that better reflects the economics of arts and culture facilities and that the current suite of real estate programs cannot succeed in this endeavor. (cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-385) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-383 et al.): "Affiliate" means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by a cultural arts institution.  Control exists in all cases in which the entity is a member of a controlled group of corporations as defined pursuant to section 1563 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1563) or the entity is an organization in a group of organizations under common control that is subject to the regulations applicable to organizations pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.414).  A cultural arts institution may establish by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the authority, that control exists in situations involving lesser percentages of ownership if the cultural arts institution shall have control, at a minimum, of all aspects of compliance with this program.  An affiliate of a cultural arts institution may contribute to the project cost and may satisfy the requirement for site control during construction and the eligibility period, but in no event shall the tax credit certificate be issued to any affiliate.

The authority shall [award tax credits under the program through a competitive application process consisting of at least one award round each year.  The authority shall provide notice to the public of the opening and closing dates for submission of program applications on the authority's Internet website] conduct a review of applications on a rolling basis, unless the authority determines that demand is likely to exceed available tax credits, at which time the authority may implement a competitive application process whereby the authority shall evaluate all applications submitted by a date certain as if all were submitted on that date. b.    [The authority shall review applications for tax credits submitted to the authority by the deadline date of the award round and shall evaluate each application as if it were received on the deadline date, without providing any preference for early submissions.  To determine priority for an award of a tax credit, all applications for cultural arts projects that satisfy the criteria set forth in sections 5 through 7 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-387 through 34:1B-389) in a given award round shall be ranked on the basis of a scoring system developed by the authority, in consultation with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. Prior to the commencement of an award round, the authority shall determine the minimum score for the award round that each applicant is required to attain to be eligible for a tax credit.] To receive a tax credit award, a cultural arts institution shall be required to meet a minimum score, as determined by the authority pursuant to this section. c.     The scoring system developed by the authority pursuant to [subsection b. of] this section shall assess applications for tax credits based on [competitive] criteria, which shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1) the amount of tax credits requested by the cultural arts institution compared to the amount of tax credits required for the completion of the cultural arts project; (2) how the cultural arts project will advance State, regional, and local goals concerning the development of arts and cultural facilities in underserved communities; (3) the relationship of the cultural arts project to a comprehensive local development strategy, including its relation to other development and redevelopment projects in the municipality; (4) the degree to which the cultural arts project enhances and promotes job creation and economic development; (5) the extent of economic and related social distress in the municipality and the immediate area surrounding the cultural arts project, including whether the cultural arts project is located in a qualified incentive tract or other areas of the State identified from time to time by the authority in rules; (6) the quality and number of new full-time jobs that will be created by the cultural arts institution; and (7) if the cultural arts institution has a board of directors, the extent to which that board of directors is diverse and representative of the community in which the cultural arts project is located. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section, the authority may adopt, pursuant to the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations adjusting [competitive] the criteria required under the program when necessary to respond to conditions in the State. e.     Prior to the award of a tax credit, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the cultural arts institution is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the cultural arts institution and the cultural arts institution shall confirm that any contractors and subcontractors performing work at the cultural arts project: (1) are registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) have not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possess a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  Provided that all parties are in compliance with this subsection, the authority shall allocate tax credits to cultural arts projects according to the cultural arts projects' scores and until either the available tax credits are exhausted or all cultural arts projects obtaining the minimum score receive a tax credit, whichever occurs first.  If insufficient funding exists to fully fund all eligible cultural arts projects, a cultural arts project may be offered a partial tax credit valued at less than what is provided for in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-386). f.     Applications that do not receive the minimum score established by the authority [for that award round] shall not receive further consideration for a tax credit by the authority [in that award round] for that application; however, a cultural arts institution may [revise or complete] submit a new application [to be submitted in a subsequent award round]. g.    [If a cultural arts institution declines a tax credit offered by the authority, the authority shall offer the tax credit to the applicant with the application having the next highest score, and having obtained at least the minimum score in that award round.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.7) 6.    Section 8 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-390) is amended to read as follows: 8. a. Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-388 and 34:1B-389), the authority shall enter into a tax credit agreement with the cultural arts institution. b.

payment of the prevailing wage for construction commencing more than two years after an entity has executed with the authority a commitment letter regarding authority financial assistance and the first payment or other provision of the assistance is received. b.    The New Jersey Economic Development Authority shall adopt rules and regulations requiring that not less than the prevailing wage

Emerge Program Act," sections 68 through 81 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-336 et al.), unless the work performed under the contract is performed on a facility owned by a landlord of the entity receiving the tax credit and less than 35 percent of the facility is leased by the entity at the time of the contract and under any agreement to subsequently lease the facility.  The prevailing wage rate shall be the rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.), and all contractors and subcontractors subject to the prevailing wage requirement set forth in this section shall be registered with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.52).  An applicant for tax credits under the ["New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Act," sections 43 through 53 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-311 through C.34:1B-321), the] "New Jersey

al.), shall certify under penalty of perjury as part of its application that all construction contracts undertaken on any project in connection with an award under the programs comply with the prevailing wage requirements of this subsection.  If at any time the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation regarding compliance with the provisions of this subsection on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit 35 percent of the tax credits allowed under the programs, and pay to the affected workers back wages in an amount that compensates the workers at the prevailing wage rate for the work performed.

STATEMENT This bill expands eligibility under the Cultural Arts Incentives Program (program), authorizes the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (authority) to accept applications on a rolling basis, and revises certain provisions concerning tax credits awarded under the program. Applicant Eligibility Under current law, certain entities that qualify as a cultural arts institution may apply for tax credits to finance the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility under the program.  Among other requirements, to be eligible for tax credits, a cultural arts institution is required to: (1) have the primary mission and specific policy goal of cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State; (2) operate and maintain the cultural arts institution facility; and (3) own or lease space in the cultural arts institution facility. This bill amends current law to provide an exception to the requirement that a cultural arts institution have the primary mission and specific policy goal of cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State.  Under the bill, an entity may qualify as a cultural arts institution so long as any part of the entitys mission and specific policy goals addresses the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State.  The bill also expands the scope of cultural arts institutions to include the National Park Service, as well as any developer that has a partnership agreement with an entity that qualifies as a cultural arts institution. The bill also amends current law to provide an exception to the requirements that a cultural arts institution operate and maintain, and either own or lease space in, the cultural arts institution facility.  Under the bill, these requirements do not apply if the cultural arts institution facility is to be operated by the National Park Service or a developer that has a partnership agreement with the cultural arts institution. Additionally, the bill amends the definition of cultural arts institution facility under current law to include, without limitation, an aquarium, botanical society, historical society, library, museum, gallery, performing arts center, national historical park, or any related facility that is principally for the support and benefit of any of the foregoing. Operating Reserve This bill removes a provision of current law that authorizes the authority to award to certain cultural arts institutions, in addition to the tax credit award otherwise provided for under the program, a tax credit valued at up to 100 percent of an operating reserve, as determined by the authority.  Current law defines an operating reserve to mean an unrestricted fund balance set aside to stabilize a nonprofits finances to mitigate against unexpected events, losses of income, and large unbudgeted expenses. Construction Prior to Application Date Under current law, an applicant is required to demonstrate that construction has not commenced at the site of the cultural arts project prior to submitting an application, unless the authority determines that the cultural arts project would not be completed without an award of tax credits under the program. This bill amends this requirement to permit some construction prior to the submission of an application, provided that the construction activities are limited to general maintenance, necessary repairs, demolition, environmental assessment, environmental investigation, and environmental remediation.  The bill also amends the definition of project cost to exclude costs incurred for construction activities prior to the date of a cultural arts institutions application under the program. Application Process Current law requires the authority to implement a competitive application process for the program.  Instead, this bill requires the authority to conduct a review of applications on a rolling basis, unless the authority determines that demand is likely to exceed available tax credits, at which time the authority may instead implement a competitive application process whereby the authority is required to evaluate all applications submitted by a date certain as if all were submitted on that date. Use of Transferred Tax Credits Under current law, the transferee to whom a tax credit certificate is transferred under the program may carry forward all or part of the tax credit amount in any of the next five successive tax periods. This bill amends this provision to permit a transferee to use the credit in the tax period for which it was issued, in the tax period in which it was issued, or in any of the next three successive tax periods.  Under the bill, the transferee may first use the credit against tax liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or in a succeeding tax period, as authorized in the bill, without the need to amend the tax return for the tax period for which the credit was issued, subject to the provisions of this section.  The transferee may carry forward an unused credit for use in any of the next five successive tax periods, and the unused credit expires thereafter. Repeal of New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Act Under current law, a total of $1.2 billion tax credits may be awarded in total under the program and the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program.  The authority is scheduled to begin accepting applications under the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program in 2026. This bill repeals the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Act that established the New Jersey Community-Anchored Development Program.
