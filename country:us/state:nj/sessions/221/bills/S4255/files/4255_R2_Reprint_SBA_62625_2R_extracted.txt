TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Zwicker and McKnight SYNOPSIS Modifies provisions of Cultural Arts Incentives Program, New Jersey Aspire Program, and Grow New Jersey Program; eliminates Community-Anchored Development Program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on June 26, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning State economic development policy, amending various parts of the statutory law, and repealing sections 43 through 53 of P.L.2020, c.156. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-384) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The New Jersey Economic Development Authority can effectively utilize cultural arts institution facilities as catalysts for broad economic development in targeted communities.  Under the legislation, facilities engaged in the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State are provided with the opportunity to facilitate targeted development, utilizing proceeds from the sale of State tax credits.  This approach harnesses the ability of cultural arts institution facilities to attract visitors and businesses to the State by leveraging the incalculable economic and cultural benefits of building and supporting world class cultural arts institutions. b.    Projects involving the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility are inherently beneficial to the State because they provide vital contributions to the communities in which they are located, and together the arts community provides immeasurable economic and cultural benefits to the State. c.     [Through a competitive application process, a cultural arts institution will make its case for an amount of tax credits necessary for a project to be able to establish occupancy costs at a competitive level.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The Legislature declares that two principal objectives underscore the policy approach of this legislation: first, that providing spaces for arts and culture to flourish will result in thriving communities; and second, the State must help to provide these spaces through an incentives program that better reflects the economics of arts and culture facilities and that the current suite of real estate programs cannot succeed in this endeavor. (cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-385) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-383 et al.): "Affiliate" means an entity that directly or indirectly controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by a cultural arts institution.  Control exists in all cases in which the entity is a member of a controlled group of corporations as defined pursuant to section 1563 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.1563) or the entity is an organization in a group of organizations under common control that is subject to the regulations applicable to organizations pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of section 414 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.414).  A cultural arts institution may establish by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the authority, that control exists in situations involving lesser percentages of ownership if the cultural arts institution shall have control, at a minimum, of all aspects of compliance with this program.  An affiliate of a cultural arts institution may contribute to the project cost and may satisfy the requirement for site control during construction and the eligibility period, but in no event shall the tax credit certificate be issued to any affiliate.

The authority shall [award tax credits under the program through a competitive application process consisting of at least one award round each year.  The authority shall provide notice to the public of the opening and closing dates for submission of program applications on the authority's Internet website] conduct a review of applications on a rolling basis, unless the authority determines that demand is likely to exceed available tax credits, at which time the authority may implement a competitive application process whereby the authority shall evaluate all applications submitted by a date certain as if all were submitted on that date. b.    [The authority shall review applications for tax credits submitted to the authority by the deadline date of the award round and shall evaluate each application as if it were received on the deadline date, without providing any preference for early submissions.  To determine priority for an award of a tax credit, all applications for cultural arts projects that satisfy the criteria set forth in sections 5 through 7 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-387 through 34:1B-389) in a given award round shall be ranked on the basis of a scoring system developed by the authority, in consultation with the New Jersey State Council on the Arts. Prior to the commencement of an award round, the authority shall determine the minimum score for the award round that each applicant is required to attain to be eligible for a tax credit.] To receive a tax credit award, a cultural arts institution shall be required to meet a minimum score, as determined by the authority pursuant to this section. c.     The scoring system developed by the authority pursuant to [subsection b. of] this section shall assess applications for tax credits based on [competitive] criteria, which shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1) the amount of tax credits requested by the cultural arts institution compared to the amount of tax credits required for the completion of the cultural arts project; (2) how the cultural arts project will advance State, regional, and local goals concerning the development of arts and cultural facilities in underserved communities; (3) the relationship of the cultural arts project to a comprehensive local development strategy, including its relation to other development and redevelopment projects in the municipality; (4) the degree to which the cultural arts project enhances and promotes job creation and economic development; (5) the extent of economic and related social distress in the municipality and the immediate area surrounding the cultural arts project, including whether the cultural arts project is located in a qualified incentive tract or other areas of the State identified from time to time by the authority in rules; (6) the quality and number of new full-time jobs that will be created by the cultural arts institution; and (7) if the cultural arts institution has a board of directors, the extent to which that board of directors is diverse and representative of the community in which the cultural arts project is located. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection c. of this section, the authority may adopt, pursuant to the provisions of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations adjusting [competitive] the criteria required under the program when necessary to respond to conditions in the State. e.     Prior to the award of a tax credit, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the cultural arts institution is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the cultural arts institution and the cultural arts institution shall confirm that any contractors and subcontractors performing work at the cultural arts project: (1) are registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) have not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possess a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  Provided that all parties are in compliance with this subsection, the authority shall allocate tax credits to cultural arts projects according to the cultural arts projects' scores and until either the available tax credits are exhausted or all cultural arts projects obtaining the minimum score receive a tax credit, whichever occurs first.  If insufficient funding exists to fully fund all eligible cultural arts projects, a cultural arts project may be offered a partial tax credit valued at less than what is provided for in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-386). f.     Applications that do not receive the minimum score established by the authority [for that award round] shall not receive further consideration for a tax credit by the authority [in that award round] for that application; however, a cultural arts institution may [revise or complete] submit a new application [to be submitted in a subsequent award round]. g.    [If a cultural arts institution declines a tax credit offered by the authority, the authority shall offer the tax credit to the applicant with the application having the next highest score, and having obtained at least the minimum score in that award round.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (cf: P.L.2023, c.197, s.7) 6.    Section 8 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-390) is amended to read as follows: 8. a.

or (ii)   80 percent of the eligible project cost for a transformative project that is located in a government-restricted municipality, which municipality did not qualify as a government-restricted municipality prior to the effective date of P.L.2025, c.2 (C.34:1B-335.3 et al.); (b)   60 percent of the eligible project cost for a residential transformative project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (c)   50 percent of the eligible project cost for any other transformative project; (2)   the total value of the project financing gap; or (3)   $400,000,000 except that for a transformative project that is developed in phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the transformative project.2 (cf: P.L.2025, c.2, s.8) 215.  Section 6 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-247) is amended to read as follows: 6. a.

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2023, c.197 (C.34:1B-384) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The New Jersey Economic Development Authority can effectively utilize cultural arts institution facilities as catalysts for broad economic development in targeted communities.  Under the legislation, facilities engaged in the cultural, educational, or artistic enrichment of the people of this State are provided with the opportunity to facilitate targeted development, utilizing proceeds from the sale of State tax credits.  This approach harnesses the ability of cultural arts institution facilities to attract visitors and businesses to the State by leveraging the incalculable economic and cultural benefits of building and supporting world class cultural arts institutions. b.    Projects involving the development or rehabilitation of a cultural arts institution facility are inherently beneficial to the State because they provide vital contributions to the communities in which they are located, and together the arts community provides immeasurable economic and cultural benefits to the State. c.     [Through a competitive application process, a cultural arts institution will make its case for an amount of tax credits necessary for a project to be able to establish occupancy costs at a competitive level.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The Legislature declares that two principal objectives underscore the policy approach of this legislation: first, that providing spaces for arts and culture to flourish will result in thriving communities; and second, the State must help to provide these spaces through an incentives program that better reflects the economics of arts and culture facilities and that the current suite of real estate programs cannot succeed in this endeavor.
