"Authorized user" means the lawful owner of a personalized handgun or a person to whom the owner has given consent to use the personalized handgun. mm. ".50 BMG cartridge" means a cartridge that is designed and intended to be fired from a center-fire rifle and that meets all of the following criteria: (1) it has an overall length of 5.54 inches from the base to the tip of the bullet; (2) the bullet diameter for the cartridge is from .510 inches to and including .511 inch; (3) the case base diameter for the cartridge is from .800 inches to and including .804 inch; and (4) the cartridge case length is 3.91 inches. nn. "Living historical reenactment" means a depiction of historical characters, scenes, historical life, or events for entertainment, education, or historical documentation through the wearing or use of period, historical, antique or vintage clothing, accessories, firearms, weapons, and other implements of the historical period. (cf: P.L.2022, c.54, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would strengthen the States current assault weapons ban by revising the definition of an assault weapon to include:   rifles with detachable magazines and one military style feature; semi-automatic shotguns with one military style feature; and semi-automatic pistols with one military style feature. The current definition of an assault weapon sets forth a list of prohibited firearms and specifically includes any firearm that is substantially identical to any of the enumerated firearms.  Under State regulations, a semi-automatic firearm is to be considered substantially identical to an enumerated firearm if it meets certain criteria. This bill codifies these regulations while expanding the number of firearms that would be considered assault weapons by adding criteria and reducing the number of criteria that must be met from two to one.  For example, under current regulations, a semi-automatic rifle that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least two listed criteria would be considered an assault weapon.  These criteria include:  a folding telescoping stock, a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.  Under the bill, additional criteria are added including a thumbhole stock and a second handgrip or a protruding grip that can be held by the non-trigger hand.  The bill also requires that only one criteria be met, rather than the currently required two.

(cf: P.L.2022, c.54, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would strengthen the States current assault weapons ban by revising the definition of an assault weapon to include:   rifles with detachable magazines and one military style feature; semi-automatic shotguns with one military style feature; and semi-automatic pistols with one military style feature. The current definition of an assault weapon sets forth a list of prohibited firearms and specifically includes any firearm that is substantially identical to any of the enumerated firearms.  Under State regulations, a semi-automatic firearm is to be considered substantially identical to an enumerated firearm if it meets certain criteria. This bill codifies these regulations while expanding the number of firearms that would be considered assault weapons by adding criteria and reducing the number of criteria that must be met from two to one.  For example, under current regulations, a semi-automatic rifle that has the ability to accept a detachable magazine and has at least two listed criteria would be considered an assault weapon.  These criteria include:  a folding telescoping stock, a pistol grip that protrudes conspicuously beneath the action of the weapon; a flash suppressor or threaded barrel designed to accommodate a flash suppressor; and a grenade launcher.  Under the bill, additional criteria are added including a thumbhole stock and a second handgrip or a protruding grip that can be held by the non-trigger hand.  The bill also requires that only one criteria be met, rather than the currently required two.
