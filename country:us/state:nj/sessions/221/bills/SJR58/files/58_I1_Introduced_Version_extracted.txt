MCKNIGHT District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Designates the month of June of every year, Dry Drowning Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution designating the month of June of each year as Dry Drowning Awareness Month. Whereas, Dry drowning and secondary drowning are rare but deadly submersion injuries that can cause death well after a person, who is often a young child, has ingested water, such as during time in a swimming pool; and Whereas, Dry drowning and secondary drowning are caused by ingesting a small amount of water, through the nose or mouth.  In dry drowning, that water causes a spasm in the persons airway, causing it to close up.  In secondary drowning, that water gets into the persons lungs and causes inflammation or swelling of the lung tissue that makes it difficult or impossible for the persons body to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide; and Whereas, Dry drowning usually occurs soon after a person exits the water, but a person experiencing secondary drowning can exhibit symptoms up to 24 hours after the water is ingested.  Both dry drowning and secondary drowning can cause trouble breathing, and in the worst case, can be fatal; and Whereas, People may not recognize the warning signs of dry drowning or secondary drowning, because the symptoms are generally also symptoms of other maladies; and Whereas, Those symptoms include coughing; increased work of breathing, where the persons body is working hard to breathe; sleepiness; forgetfulness, or change in behavior; and vomiting; and Whereas, Dry drowning and secondary drowning can be prevented in the same manner as any other kind of drowning  through water safety measures.  Children should take swimming lessons in order to become comfortable and skilled at moving around in water, children should be closely supervised while in and around the water, pool safety rules should be enforced, and parents and other adults should practice other water safety measures, including having children wear flotation devices in and around water; and Whereas, It is fitting and proper, as a matter of public health, to designate the month of June of each year, Dry Drowning Awareness Month; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The month of June each year is designated as Dry Drowning Awareness Month to promote awareness about the danger of dry drowning, and to familiarize the public with symptoms of dry drowning. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing Dry Drowning Awareness Month in New Jersey and call upon public officials and the people of this State to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the month of June of each year as Dry Drowning Awareness Month in New Jersey, and respectfully requests the Governor to annually issue a proclamation recognizing the month and calling on public officials and the people of New Jersey to observe the month with appropriate programs and activities. Dry drowning and secondary drowning are rare but deadly submersion injuries that can cause death well after a person, who is often a young child, has ingested water, such as during time in a swimming pool.  Dry drowning and secondary drowning are caused by ingesting a small amount of water, through the nose or mouth.  In dry drowning, that water causes a spasm in the persons airway, causing it to close up.  In secondary drowning, that water gets into the persons lungs and causes inflammation or swelling of the lung tissue that makes it difficult or impossible for the persons body to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide; and dry drowning usually occurs soon after a person exits the water, but a person experiencing secondary drowning can exhibit symptoms up to 24 hours after the water is ingested.  Both cause trouble with breathing, and in the worst case, can be fatal.  Broader awareness of the causes and symptoms of dry drowning and secondary drowning will save lives, especially during the busy summer season when family fun oftentimes revolves around water activities.
