Under the bill, the GIT credit is equal to payments made by a qualified taxpayer, during that part of the taxable year they were employed in the State.  The GIT credit for an individual taxpayer is equal to the lesser of: (1) the taxpayer's monthly loan payments multiplied by the number of months the taxpayer made loan payments; or (2) the benchmark loan payment multiplied by the number of months during the taxable year in which a taxpayer made loan payments.  The GIT credit is refundable if an individual taxpayer earned an associates degree or a bachelors degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.  The refundable GIT credit is available only to individual taxpayers and is not available to a business that makes loan payments on behalf of an employee. A gross income taxpayer who is an employer or a business subject to the CBT may receive a tax credit equal to any payments made on behalf of a qualified employee who graduated from an accredited institution of higher education and was employed in New Jersey during the tax year.  The GIT credit for a taxpayer who is an employer and the CBT credit are equal to the monthly loan payment made by the employer multiplied by the number of loan payments made by a taxpayer on behalf of a qualified employee during a taxable year or privilege period.  The credit is reduced to 50 percent if a qualified employee is employed on a part-time basis. The bill defines a qualified employee as a resident taxpayer who (1) obtained an associates degree or a bachelors degree from an accredited institution of higher education or a graduate degree from an accredited institution of higher education who was employed in this State during the privilege period; and (2) was employed in New Jersey on a full-time or part-time basis by an employer, was a self-employed individual, or was an active duty member of the United States Armed Forces, New Jersey National Guard, or the Reserve Component of the United States Armed Forces.
