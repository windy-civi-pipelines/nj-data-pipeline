year due to the limitations of this subsection or under other provisions of
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. may be carried forward, if necessary, to the seven
taxable years following the taxable year for which the tax credit was allowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      d.   If the tax credit
allowed pursuant to this section, together with any payments, credits, deductions,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes an
incentive for New Jersey residents who have graduated from a community college,
college or university, or graduate school to stay, or return to, New Jersey
after their graduation and for employers to hire college graduates to work in
this State and subsidizes their loan payments.  The bill provides qualified
taxpayers and businesses with a credit against the gross income tax (GIT) or
the corporation business tax (CBT) for certain educational loan payments.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The tax credit is allowed for
any payments made by a taxpayer or on behalf of a taxpayer during the taxable
or privilege period on a loan which is: (1) secured through a State student
loan program, a federal student loan program, or a commercial lender and which
is (2) obtained and expended exclusively for purpose of paying the tuition and
fees and other expenses such as room and board and book and books and supplies,
related directly to the enrollment of the qualified taxpayer at an institution
of higher education.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the GIT credit
is equal to payments made by a qualified taxpayer, during that part of the
taxable year they were employed in the State.  The GIT credit for an individual
taxpayer is equal to the lesser of: (1) the taxpayer's monthly loan payments multiplied
by the number of months the taxpayer made loan payments; or (2) the benchmark
loan payment multiplied by the number of months during the taxable year in
which a taxpayer made loan payments.  The GIT credit is refundable if an
individual taxpayer earned an associates degree or a bachelors degree in
science, technology, engineering, or mathematics.  The refundable GIT credit is
available only to individual taxpayers and is not available to a business that
makes loan payments on behalf of an employee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A gross income taxpayer who is
an employer or a business subject to the CBT may receive a tax credit equal to
any payments made on behalf of a qualified employee who graduated from an
accredited institution of higher education and was employed in New Jersey
during the tax year.  The GIT credit for a taxpayer who is an employer and the
CBT credit are equal to the monthly loan payment made by the employer
multiplied by the number of loan payments made by a taxpayer on behalf of a
qualified employee during a taxable year or privilege period.  The credit is
reduced to 50 percent if a qualified employee is employed on a part-time
basis.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines a qualified
employee as a resident taxpayer who (1) obtained an associates degree or a
bachelors degree from an accredited institution of higher education or a
graduate degree from an accredited institution of higher education who was
employed in this State during the privilege period; and (2) was employed in New
Jersey on a full-time or part-time basis by an employer, was a self-employed
individual, or was an active duty member of the United States Armed Forces, New
Jersey National Guard, or the Reserve Component of the United States Armed
Forces.  </p>
