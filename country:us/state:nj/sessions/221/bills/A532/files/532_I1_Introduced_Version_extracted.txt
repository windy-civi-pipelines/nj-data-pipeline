In the first full year when an existing appropriation or expenditure that is not subject to budget limitations is made subject to budget limitations, a municipality shall add to its final appropriations upon which its permissible expenditures are calculated pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.2), the amount which the municipality expended for that purpose during the last full budget year, or portion thereof, in which the purpose so excepted was funded from appropriations in the municipal budget. (cf: P.L.2007, c.311, s.17) 2.  Section 10 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.45) is amended to read as follows: 10.  a.  (1)  In the preparation of its budget the amount to be raised by taxation by a local unit shall not exceed, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the sum of new ratables, the adjusted tax levy, and the total of waivers approved pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46); provided, however, that in the case of a county, the amount to be raised by taxation shall not exceed the amount permitted by section 4 of P.L.1976, c.68 (C.40A:4-45.4). (2)  A local unit that has not been granted approval for a waiver pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46), may add to its adjusted tax levy in any one of the next three succeeding years, the amount of the difference between the maximum allowable amount to be raised by taxation or county purposes tax, as applicable, for the current local budget year pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and the actual amount to be raised by taxation or county purposes tax, as applicable, for the current local budget year. b.    The following exclusions shall be added to the calculation of the adjusted tax levy: (1)  increases in amounts required to be raised by taxation for capital expenditures, including debt service as defined by law; (2)  increases in pension contributions and accrued liability for pension contributions in excess of 2.0%; (3)  increases in health care costs equal to that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year that is in excess of 2.0% of the total health care costs in the prior year, but is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prior year and the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury; [and] (4)  extraordinary costs incurred by a local unit directly related to a declared emergency, as defined by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, as appropriate; and (5)  increases in direct contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad that serves the local unit equal to that portion of the actual increase in total direct contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad that serves the local unit for the budget year that is in excess of 2.0% of the total direct contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad that served the local unit in the prior budget year. If there are no exclusions, then the amount of the difference shall reduce the adjusted tax levy by that amount.  Any cancelled or unexpended appropriation for any exclusion pursuant to this subsection or waiver pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46), also shall be deducted from the sum of the exclusions listed in this subsection or directly reduce the adjusted tax levy if there are no exclusions. (cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.9) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to budgets adopted by a municipality following the date of enactment. STATEMENT The bill moves contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad outside of the budget appropriation and property tax levy caps for certain local units. N.J.S.A.40A:4-45.3 requires that a municipality limit appropriation increases to 2.5 percent or the cost-of-living adjustment, whichever is less, over the previous year's final appropriations, but provides for certain exceptions.  The bill would add contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad that serves the municipality to an existing list of allowable exceptions. N.J.S.A.40A:4-45.45 concerns the preparation of a local units budget with respect to the amount to be raised by taxation.  The bill would allow local units to raise funds from property taxpayers for certain contributions to a volunteer first aid or rescue squad by making this purpose an exclusion from the property tax levy cap.
