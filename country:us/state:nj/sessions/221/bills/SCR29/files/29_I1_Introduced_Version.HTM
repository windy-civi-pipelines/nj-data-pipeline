BRAMNICK District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Proposes amendment to Constitution to describe manner in which Legislature will provide for maintenance and support of thorough and efficient system of free public schools. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Concurrent Resolution proposing to amend Article VIII, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. Be It Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey (the General Assembly concurring): 1.    The following proposed amendment to the Constitution of the State of New Jersey is agreed to: PROPOSED AMENDMENT Amend Article VIII, Section IV, paragraph 1 to read as follows: 1.    The Legislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools for the instruction of all the children in the State between the ages of five and eighteen years.  Maintenance and support shall be provided through the enactment, from time to time, of laws prescribing the components of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools.  These laws shall also provide for the funding of a system of free public schools in a manner and to the extent the Legislature determines to be appropriate including, but not limited to, the amount of funds to be provided by the State and by the local school districts, the purposes for which these funds are to be expended, the formulas pursuant to which these funds are to be allocated, and the manner and means by which these funds are to be raised.  These laws shall provide for equitable funding, considering variations in student and community need, as demonstrated by recent and relevant data, and shall not result in significant disparities in the amount of State funding provided per student in different communities. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring any minimum or establishing any maximum amount of funds to be provided by the State, requiring the State to provide funding based on any level of funding provided in a prior year, or in any way restricting, limiting, or otherwise affecting the right of the Legislature to regulate the funding of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools in the manner and to the extent the Legislature determines to be appropriate. (cf:  Art. VIII, Sec. IV, par. 1) 2.    When this proposed amendment to the Constitution is finally agreed to pursuant to Article IX, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, it shall be submitted to the people at the next general election occurring more than three months after the final agreement and shall be published at least once in at least one newspaper of each county designated by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Secretary of State, not less than three months prior to the general election. 3.    This proposed amendment to the Constitution shall be submitted to the people at that election in the following manner and form: There shall be printed on each official ballot to be used at the general election, the following: a.     In every municipality in which voting machines are not used, a legend which shall immediately precede the question as follows: If you favor the proposition printed below make a cross (X), plus (+), or check (a) in the square opposite the word "Yes."  If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b. In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINE THE COMPONENTS OF A THOROUGH AND EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS YES Do you approve amending the Constitution to state that the Legislature will decide how to provide for a thorough and efficient system of free public schools?  The Legislature would also decide how to fund public education. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment provides that the Legislature will decide how to provide public education in New Jersey.  The Legislature would pass laws to identify the components of a thorough and efficient system of public schools.  It would also determine how public schools will be funded. Funding for public schools would be equitable and would use recent data to take into account the needs of students and school districts.  The laws would provide for similar State per-pupil funding in different school districts.  The amendment explicitly provides that there is no minimum or maximum amount of required State school funding in a given fiscal year.  It also provides that State school funding does not have to be based on the amount provided in a prior year. STATEMENT This proposed amendment to the Constitution states that the Legislature, through the enactment of laws, will determine the components of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools, and how such a system will be funded.  The financing mechanism would include the amount that should be funded locally, as well as by the State. State funding provided for education must be equitable, take student and community needs into consideration, and not result in significant disparities in per student funding across different communities.  However, the constitutional provision is not to be construed as establishing a minimum or maximum funding level.  Additionally, the State would not be required to consider the amount of funding provided to a community in prior years when determining State funding in subsequent years.
