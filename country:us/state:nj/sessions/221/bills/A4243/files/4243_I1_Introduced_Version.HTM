traveling to and from, or remaining within, their personal residence if that residence is within 100 feet of a ballot drop box; investigating, addressing, or removing any cause for a disturbance, or otherwise responding to a request for assistance, on or around the premises of the location of that ballot drop box;

(2)  select the geographic location of each ballot drop box, ensuring an equitable distribution of ballot drop boxes across the county to maximize convenience to voters; (3)  ensure the accessibility of ballot drop boxes and drop box locations to persons with disabilities; and (4)  maintain the security of ballot drop boxes and of the ballots deposited therein, including standards and procedures for ballot retrieval by authorized persons only, and for ensuring the proper chain of custody and safe storage of voted mail-in ballots before each election. d.    Each county clerk shall include the locations of the ballot drop boxes established in the county along with the instructions furnished with the mail-in ballot package sent to each mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45 days before each election, each county board of elections shall cause to be published on their respective websites the location of the ballot drop boxes in each county, and shall provide this information to the Secretary of State for publishing the same on the Division of Elections website. e.     Whenever a municipal, school, or special election is held, the board shall, at a minimum, open the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located and the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location.  When a school election encompasses more than one municipality, the board shall be responsible for the selection of the ballot drop box location with respect to each municipality. (cf: P.L.2022, c.70, s.4) 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, the presence of police officers at polling places during the conduct of an election and at ballot drop box locations in use during the conduct of an election is limited. This bill removes the prohibition on police presence at ballot drop boxes and polling places that was adopted into law in 2021 (P.L.2021, c.459).   Under this bill, police are once again permitted to be within 100 feet of a ballot drop box or polling place during the conduct of an election while in an official capacity.  The bill also removes the following provisions of current law: · a provision requiring a district board of elections to notify the county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as appropriate, of the dispatch of a police officer or other law enforcement officer to a polling place; · a provision requiring the county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as appropriate, to notify the Secretary of State of the dispatch of a police officer or other law enforcement officer to a polling place; and · a provision requiring the Secretary of State, county boards of elections, and superintendents of elections to maintain a record of all dispatches issued and reported to a polling place.

or escorting to or from, or both, a ballot drop box or the premise on which it is located any person who may require the assistance of the officer.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) (g)  No person shall wear, display, sell, give, or provide any political or campaign slogan, badge, button, or other insignia associated with any political party or candidate within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election, except with respect to the badge furnished by the county board as provided by law.  A person violating the provisions of this subparagraph shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense. c.     The Secretary of State, in consultation with county boards of elections, shall establish the guidelines necessary to ensure the secure and successful implementation of the mail-in ballot drop boxes required by this section to ensure adequate access in various geographic areas of the county.  In determining the ballot drop box locations, the secretary and county boards of elections shall consider, at a minimum, concentrations of population, geographic areas, voter convenience, proximity to public transportation, community-based locations, travel time to the location, proximity to other voting locations and ballot drop boxes, commuter traffic patterns, and security.  The guidelines shall include, but may not be limited to, criteria for each county board of elections to: (1)  determine the number of ballot drop boxes required per voter population, considering both the number of registered voters and the number of registered mail-in voters in each county before each election; (2)  select the geographic location of each ballot drop box, ensuring an equitable distribution of ballot drop boxes across the county to maximize convenience to voters; (3)  ensure the accessibility of ballot drop boxes and drop box locations to persons with disabilities; and (4)  maintain the security of ballot drop boxes and of the ballots deposited therein, including standards and procedures for ballot retrieval by authorized persons only, and for ensuring the proper chain of custody and safe storage of voted mail-in ballots before each election. d.    Each county clerk shall include the locations of the ballot drop boxes established in the county along with the instructions furnished with the mail-in ballot package sent to each mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45 days before each election, each county board of elections shall cause to be published on their respective websites the location of the ballot drop boxes in each county, and shall provide this information to the Secretary of State for publishing the same on the Division of Elections website. e.     Whenever a municipal, school, or special election is held, the board shall, at a minimum, open the ballot drop box located geographically closest to the municipal government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located and the ballot drop box located at the board of elections or county office, if one is placed at that location.  When a school election encompasses more than one municipality, the board shall be responsible for the selection of the ballot drop box location with respect to each municipality. (cf: P.L.2022, c.70, s.4) 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, the presence of police officers at polling places during the conduct of an election and at ballot drop box locations in use during the conduct of an election is limited. This bill removes the prohibition on police presence at ballot drop boxes and polling places that was adopted into law in 2021 (P.L.2021, c.459).   Under this bill, police are once again permitted to be within 100 feet of a ballot drop box or polling place during the conduct of an election while in an official capacity.  The bill also removes the following provisions of current law: · a provision requiring a district board of elections to notify the county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as appropriate, of the dispatch of a police officer or other law enforcement officer to a polling place; · a provision requiring the county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as appropriate, to notify the Secretary of State of the dispatch of a police officer or other law enforcement officer to a polling place; and · a provision requiring the Secretary of State, county boards of elections, and superintendents of elections to maintain a record of all dispatches issued and reported to a polling place.
