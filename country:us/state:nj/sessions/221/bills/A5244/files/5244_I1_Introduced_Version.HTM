(cf: P.L.2013, c.123, s.1) 3.    Section 29.3 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-41) is amended to read as follows: 29.3.  Contents of site plan ordinance.  An ordinance requiring site plan review and approval pursuant to this article shall include and shall be limited to, except as provided in sections 29 and 29.1 of this act standards and requirements relating to: a.     Preservation of existing natural resources on the site; b.    Safe and efficient vehicular and pedestrian circulation, parking and loading; c.     Screening, landscaping and location of structures; d.    Exterior lighting needed for safety reasons in addition to any requirements for street lighting; e.     Conservation of energy and use of renewable energy sources, including solar photovoltaic or solar thermal systems, in a manner that maximizes solar gain; and f.     Recycling of designated recyclable materials. (cf: P.L.1987, c.102, s.28) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill authorizes that a municipal land use ordinance, site plan ordinance, and a municipalitys master plan contain provisions ensuring authorization for the design, development, orientation, and construction of developments and other structures, in a manner that is most beneficial to the installation, use, and efficacy of an operational solar photovoltaic or solar thermal system, in a manner that maximizes solar gain.  This legislation would save homeowners and developers time and money in trying to align solar systems to the sun after construction by building this alignment into the structures at the time of conception.
