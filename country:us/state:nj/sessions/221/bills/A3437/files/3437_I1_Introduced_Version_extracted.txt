The purpose of this bill is to incentivize small businesses to establish employee stock ownership plans.  An employee stock ownership plan allows companies to share ownership with employees without requiring employees to invest their own money.  In addition, this bill encourages small business owners to sell their businesses to the very employees that contributed to their success.  This will help to ensure that local businesses are not sold to out-of-state buyers, which is often detrimental to the fabric of local communities.
