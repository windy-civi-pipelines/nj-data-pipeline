shall apply to the estate of every decedent whether said decedent died before March 25, 1935, or shall die thereafter, but it shall not entitle any person to a refund of any tax paid before the aforementioned date. (cf: P.L.2003, c.246, s.37) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the New Jersey transfer inheritance tax to eliminate the tax on brothers and sisters of a decedent for transfers made on or after January 1, 2022.  Presently, transfers to brothers and sisters of a decedent are taxed according to the rate imposed on "Class C" beneficiaries, or at a rate of 11 to 16 percent depending on the amount transferred, with the first $25,000 exempt from taxation.  This bill would effectively treat transfers to a brother or sister of a decedent on par with transfers to other immediate family members, including the spouse, domestic partner, civil union partner, father, mother, grandparent, or child of a decedent.
