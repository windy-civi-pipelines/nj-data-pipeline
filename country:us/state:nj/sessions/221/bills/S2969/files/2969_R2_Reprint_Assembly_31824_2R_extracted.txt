(3)  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a county may add to its adjusted tax levy the greater of the amount authorized pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section or the amount of the difference between the amount of its county tax levy and the 3.5% percentage rate accumulated pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1994, c.100 (C.40A:4-45.15b). b.    The following exclusions shall be added to the calculation of the adjusted tax levy: increases in amounts required to be raised by taxation for capital expenditures, including debt service as defined by law; increases in pension contributions and accrued liability for pension contributions in excess of 2.0%; increases in health care costs equal to that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year that is in excess of 2.0% of the total health care costs in the prior year, but is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prior year and the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury; and extraordinary costs incurred by a local unit directly related to a declared emergency, as defined by regulation promulgated by the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, as appropriate. If there are no exclusions, then the amount of the difference shall reduce the adjusted tax levy by that amount.  Any cancelled or unexpended appropriation for any exclusion pursuant to this subsection or waiver pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2007, c.62 (C.40A:4-45.46), also shall be deducted from the sum of the exclusions listed in this subsection or directly reduce the adjusted tax levy if there are no exclusions.2 (cf: P.L.2010, c.44, s.9) 2[2.] 4.2  This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to any local budget year beginning on or after January 1, 2024.
