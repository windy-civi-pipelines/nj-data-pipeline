The development of a State expenditure Internet website is intended to provide State residents with an easily accessible and comprehensive one stop source for information on the expenditure of State funds. Similar to initiatives in more than a dozen states, the development of a single, searchable website for contract and grant data and information will improve transparency and accountability and simplify the process to access information concerning the allocation and spending of public tax dollars.
