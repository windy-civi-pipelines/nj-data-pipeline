<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
by allowing for the construction of crematories as stand-alone facilities
separate and apart from cemeteries and funeral homes. Presently, New Jersey
only allows crematories to be located on cemetery property or to operate as
facilities that work in conjunction with funeral homes in existence prior to
December 1, 1971. Under this bill, a governmental entity, a religious
corporation or organization, or a cremation company, defined in the bill as a
person that owns, manages, operates or controls a crematory, directly or
indirectly, that is a stand-alone facility located on property owned or leased by
the cremation company and that is separate and apart from a cemetery and
funeral home, is allowed to open and operate a crematory. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill incorporates
crematories and crematory companies into certain provisions of law that
currently only apply to cemeteries. This includes provisions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    to allow crematories to
be owned or operated only by a governmental entity, a religious corporation or
organization, or a cremation company;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    to require cremation
companies to be formed as nonprofits in compliance with Title 15A of the New
Jersey Statutes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3)    to require a crematory
company to file with the New Jersey Cemetery Board the paperwork showing the
name and address of the company; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4)    to mandate that a
crematory company print and conspicuously post its regulations and charges for
services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5)    on the disposition of
human remains;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    to allow for the

consent of the municipality by resolution; </p>

approval if a crematory company seeks to enlarge a crematory;</p>

the land it owns, if approved by the board;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9)    to require licensure for
any natural person who is compensated to act as a crematory salesperson for
goods and services provided by a crematory company;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10)  to establish that a
crematory may be located on cemetery property, on property owned or leased by a
funeral home created prior to December 1, 1971 and on property owned or leased
by a crematory company; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11)  to allow crematory
companies to be included on the registry maintained by the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     New provisions in the bill
require a crematory company to file an annual report with the board within 120
days after the close of the companys fiscal year. Crematory companies are
required to establish rules and regulations addressing the use, management, and
protection of the crematory. Crematory companies are prohibited from
manufacturing or selling urns or other goods used as a vessel for cremains and
from being involved in the conduct of any funeral home or of the business or
profession of mortuary science. Crematory companies are also required to
maintain records of each cremation performed by the company, including the name
of the cremated party and the party who authorized the cremation, and will be
exempt from several taxes of which cemeteries are also exempt, including real
estate taxes, rates or assessment on personal property taxes on lands and
equipment dedicated to crematory purposes. </p>
