<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning</span> the installation and use of electronic
monitoring devices at group homes for individuals with developmental disabilities,
and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.   The
Legislature finds and declares the following:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   Individuals
with developmental disabilities are particularly vulnerable to abuse, neglect,
and exploitation by caregivers, guardians, and other persons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Group
homes for individuals with developmental</span><b><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif;letter-spacing:0pt'> </span></b><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>disabilities admirably enable these individuals to
live more independently within a non-institutional setting; however, the lack
of institutional controls and oversight at these homes ultimately makes it
harder for the State, for individual group home operators, and for concerned
family members to promptly identify and respond to wrongdoing that may be
committed by caregivers, guardians, group home employees, and other persons at
the home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   The
safety and quality of life of individuals with developmental disabilities who
receive care from group homes is of paramount concern, and the use of video
monitoring is a reasonable means by which the State and concerned family
members can better ensure the prevention of, and the institution of a more
proactive response to, the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of group home
residents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      d.   The
rights of individuals with developmental disabilities, including the right to
privacy, should be respected and preserved at all times, to the greatest extent
practicable; however, just as is true of all citizens, an individual with a
developmental disability or the individuals authorized representative, as the
case may be, may consent to the waiver or limitation of the individuals
rights, particularly the individuals rights to privacy, by knowingly agreeing
to video surveillance, as deemed by the individual or the authorized
representative to be appropriate.  The provisions of this act are consistent
with federal regulations pertaining to community-based services, particularly
regulations which protect an individual's right to privacy, dignity, respect,
and freedom from coercion and restraint.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      e.   It
is in the public interest for the State to provide for the enhanced protection
of individuals with developmental disabilities who reside at group homes by
enabling group home residents, or their authorized representatives, to
cooperatively and collectively decide whether to allow for the installation and
use of video monitoring devices in the common areas of the group homes, and to
individually decide whether to allow for the installation and use of video
monitoring devices in the private residential room of each such resident, so
that the treatment of such residents can be recorded and instances of abuse,
neglect, or exploitation documented with video evidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      f.    The
use of video surveillance in group homes will enable consenting residents and
their authorized representatives to more proactively and effectively review and
ensure the propriety of care that is being provided to such residents and will
further enable the State, licensed service providers, and whistleblowers to
more easily verify, and obtain evidence to substantiate or refute, allegations
of abuse, neglect, and exploitation occurring in group homes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      g.   The
State recognizes that each individual with developmental disabilities is unique
and has differing needs and preferences, and that, while some group home
residents and their authorized representatives may consent to the use of video
surveillance to better ensure the residents safety, others may refuse to
consent to such video surveillance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      h.   Through
the enactment of this act, it is the intent of the Legislature to make video
monitoring technology more readily available in group home settings, while
taking great care to strike the important and delicate balance between
protecting the privacy rights and protecting the overall well-being of group
home residents.  By increasing the availability of video monitoring technology
in group homes, the Legislature intends to:  (1) make it easier for residents
and their authorized representatives to monitor the residents care, if they so
choose; (2) make it easier for concerned family members and whistleblowers to
file and substantiate complaints of abuse, neglect, exploitation, or other
improper care or treatment involving group home residents; and (3) improve the
ability of the State and of individual licensees to verify and appropriately
respond to such complaints. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      i.    This
act is dedicated to William Billy Cray, a 33-year-old with developmental disabilities
who, on a Sunday morning in</span><b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>
</span></b>August<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'> 2017, was inexplicably found
dead on the floor of his bedroom closet</span><b><sup><span style='font-family:

Health New Jersey, where he resided.  Billy Cray, who had suffered from

dedicated and long-time advocate for persons with developmental disabilities. 
For many years, both preceding and following her sons death, Martha Cray has
continued to work tirelessly to advance legislation protecting the rights and
safety of individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly those
residing in group homes.  She was particularly instrumental in facilitating the
passage of Stephen Komninos Law, P.L.2017, c.238 (C.30:6D-9.1), which
provides for the heightened scrutiny of group homes by requiring more frequent,
unannounced oversight visits, and which requires group homes to provide prompt
notice of injury to the parent or guardian of an injured resident.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      j.    Billy
Crays death is yet another reminder of why the State needs to continue its
work both to strengthen oversight of group homes for individuals with
developmental disabilities and to further facilitate and enhance the ability of
group home residents and their family members or guardians, as the case may be,
to take affirmative steps to protect the rights and safety of residents and
promptly and appropriately respond to resident injuries and other concerning
incidents occurring in the group homes.  By enabling group home residents with
developmental disabilities and their authorized representatives to use
video-based electronic monitoring to protect against, provide documentary
evidence of, and ensure a prompt and adequate response to, any abuse, neglect,
and exploitation occurring in the group home, the Legislature can further
preserve the rights and safety of group home residents and facilitate the
proactive prevention of deaths like Billy Crays.    </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide
certain requirements in association with the use of electronic monitoring
devices (EMDs) at group homes for individuals with developmental disabilities. 
An EMD is a camera or other electronic device that uses video, but not audio,
recording capabilities to monitor the activities taking place in the area where
the device is installed.  The safety and quality of life of individuals with
developmental disabilities who receive care from group homes is of paramount
concern, and the use of video monitoring is one way in which the State can
better ensure the prevention of, and the institution of a more proactive
response to, the abuse, neglect, and exploitation of group home residents. 
This bill would make video monitoring technology more readily available in
group home settings, while taking great care to strike the important and
delicate balance between protecting the privacy rights and protecting the
overall well-being of group home residents.  Specifically, the bill would
enable, but not require, group home residents or their authorized
representatives, as the case may be, to cooperatively and collectively decide
whether to allow for the installation and use of EMDs in the common areas of
the group homes, and to individually decide whether to allow for the
installation and use of EMDs in the private residential room of each such
resident, so that the treatment of such residents can be recorded and instances
of abuse, neglect, or exploitation documented with video evidence.  In
providing these authorizations, the bill respects the rights of all individuals
with developmental disabilities, places a premium on their individuality, and
recognizes that different people have different needs and preferences with
respect to the use of video surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Scope of Bill</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The term group home is
defined more broadly in this bill than it is in other laws.  Specifically, the
term is defined to mean a living arrangement that is operated in a residence or
residences leased or owned by a licensee; which living arrangement either provides
the opportunity for multiple adults with developmental disabilities to live
together in a non-institutional, home-based setting or provides the opportunity
for a single adult with developmental disabilities and extreme behavioral
difficulties to live more independently, outside of an institution, while still
receiving full-time care; and in which on-site staff provides supervision,
training, or assistance, in a variety of forms and intensity, as required to
prevent or delay the institutionalization of the individual or individuals
residing in the home or to otherwise assist the individual or individuals as
they move toward independence.  Group home does not include a living
arrangement that is dedicated for use by children with developmental
disabilities.  The revised definition used in the bill makes it clear that this
term not only includes facilities that house multiple persons with
developmental disabilities, but also includes facilities that, while commonly
referred to as supervised apartments, provide group home-style living for a
single person who has developmental disabilities and particularly severe
behavioral difficulties that prevent them from being housed in a group home with
other disabled persons.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require group
homes, as defined thereunder, to install EMDs in the common areas, upon the
agreement, request, and uniform consent of all residents.  Common areas is
defined to include entrances, living areas, dining areas, stairwells, and
outdoor areas, but not bathroom areas.  The bill would additionally require
group homes to permit the installation and use of EMDs in the private rooms of
group home residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is not intended to
impose new electronic monitoring requirements on those group home providers who
already engage in electronic monitoring pursuant to an internal organizational
policy.  As a result, the bill includes a provision that grandfathers-in and
exempts from the bills provisions those group homes that have already
installed, and are utilizing, EMDs as of the bills effective date. 
Specifically, the bill provides that any such group home:  1) may continue to
use previously installed EMDs in accordance with the organizations written policies;
2) will not be required to comply with the bills consent requirements in order
to continue utilizing the devices; and 3) will not be required to remove the
existing devices from service unless the residents collectively indicate,
within six months after the bills effective date, that they want such devices
to be removed.  To the extent that a group homes common areas or private rooms
do not contain EMDs on the bills effective date, the licensee will be required
to comply with the bill when installing new EMDs in such unmonitored areas. 
The bill is intended to give residents  particularly those with severe
behavioral difficulties  the right to request electronic monitoring in the
group home, as necessary to ensure their safe care.  The bill is not intended
to impose new electronic monitoring requirements on providers that already
engage in electronic monitoring; and it is not intended to require other group
home providers to commence electronic monitoring, except in those cases where
the residents have requested and agreed to such monitoring.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Installation and Use of EMDs
in Common Areas</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions,
any group home that does not have EMDs already installed in the group homes
common areas will be required to install EMDs in those common areas, upon the
collective request of the residents and the residents authorized
representatives, if all of the residents of the group home and their authorized
representatives agree to have EMDs installed and expressly consent to the
installation and use of such devices.  A licensee will be prohibited from
requiring the group homes current residents to consent to the installation and
use of EMDs in the common areas as a condition of their continued residency in
the group home.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A licensee operating a group
home that does not have EMDs already installed in the common areas will be
required:  1) within six months after the group home adopts an internal
electronic monitoring policy pursuant to the bills provisions, to take
affirmative action to determine whether the residents of the group home and
their authorized representatives want and collectively consent to have EMDs
installed and used in the group homes common areas; 2) annually provide
written notice to all residents and their authorized representatives informing
them of their right to collectively request and consent to the installation and
use of EMDs in the group homes common areas; and 3) install new EMDs in the
common areas within one year after receipt of a collective request therefor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require any
group home that installs and uses EMDs in its common areas, pursuant to the
agreement, request, and consent of the residents, to:  1) require each person
employed by the group home to provide express written consent to the use of the
EMDs in the group homes common areas, as a condition of the persons
employment; 2) ensure that a prominent written notice is posted at the entrance
and exit doors to the home informing visitors that they will be subject to
electronic video monitoring while present in the home; and 3) ensure that,
following the installation of EMDs in the common areas, the group home only
allows residence by those individuals who consent to the ongoing use of EMDs in
the group homes common areas.  The licensee is to comply with the first two of
these requirements within one year after receiving a collective request from
residents authorizing electronic monitoring of the common areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The EMDs installed in a group
homes common areas are to be unobstructed and recording at all times.  Each
licensee will be required to inspect the devices, and document the results of
each inspection, on a weekly basis.  The DHS will further be required to
annually conduct an on-site device inspection, as part of its broader group
home inspection authority, in order to ensure that the EMDs installed in a
group homes common areas are functioning properly, as required by the bill.  A
resident or the residents authorized representative will be authorized to
access and review any footage that is recorded by an EMD in the common areas of
the group home; provided that the person first submits a request indicating
that the resident has experienced, or that the resident or authorized
representative has witnessed, an incident of abuse, neglect, or exploitation
occurring in the common areas.  A group home licensee may require that a
resident or the residents authorized representative remain on the premises of
the group home when accessing and reviewing footage recorded in the common
areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All of the costs associated
with installation and maintenance of an EMD in the group homes common areas
are to be paid by the group home licensee.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would specify that an
individuals refusal to consent to the use of EMDs in a group homes common
areas may not be used as a basis to prevent the timely placement of the
individual in appropriate housing without surveillance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Removal of EMDs from Common
Areas</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A group home that has EMDs
installed in the common areas will be required to remove those EMDs from
service, as provided by the bill, if all of the residents of the group home and
their authorized representatives collectively agree to, and request, the
removal of the EMDs from the common areas.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, if the
EMDs in a group homes common areas were already in operation as of the bills
effective date, the licensee will be required to take affirmative action,
within six months after the bills effective date, to determine whether the
residents of the group home and their authorized representatives want, and
collectively agree, to have the existing EMDs removed from the common areas.  If
the residents do not collectively agree to the removal of the EMDs, the
licensee will be authorized to:  1) continue using the devices in the common
areas, in accordance with the group homes internal policies, as provided by section
7 of the bill (which is the section of the bill that exempts from the bills
requirements any group home that already has EMDs installed as of the bills
effective date); and 2) accept, as new residents, only those persons who
consent to the ongoing use of the devices in the common areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further provides
that, if the EMDs in a group homes common areas were not in operation as of
the bills effective date, or if the EMDs existing in a group homes common
areas on the bills effective date were removed by the licensee pursuant to the
collective agreement of residents, as described above, the licensee will be
required to provide written notice to all residents and their authorized
representatives, within 10 days after EMDs are newly placed into the common
areas under the bill, and annually thereafter, informing the residents and
their authorized representatives of their right to collectively request the
removal of existing EMDs from the group homes common areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a group home
licensee to remove any EMDs from the common areas within one year after receipt
of a collective request from residents therefor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Installation and Use of EMDs
in Private Rooms</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would further require
all group homes to permit EMDs to be installed and used, on a voluntary and
noncompulsory basis, in the private rooms of residents.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The installation and use of
EMDs in a private single occupancy room may be done by the resident or the
residents authorized representative, at any time, following the residents
provision of written notice to the licensee of the residents intent to engage
in electronic monitoring of the private room.  Such written notice is to be
submitted to the licensee at least 15 days prior to installation of the devices
in the private single occupancy room.  Any resident, or the authorized
representative thereof, who provides such a notice of intent to install EMDs in
a private single occupancy room, or who so installs such devices, will be
deemed to have implicitly consented to electronic monitoring of the private
room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The installation and use of
EMDs in a private double occupancy room may be effectuated only with the
express written consent of the roommates of the resident who requested the
monitoring, or of the roommates authorized representatives, as the case may
be.  A roommate may place conditions on his or her consent to the use of EMDs
within the double occupancy room, including conditions that require the EMDs to
be pointed away from the consenting roommate at all times during operation, or
at certain specified times.  The roommates consent to electronic monitoring,
and any conditions on the roommates consent, are to be memorialized in a
formal electronic monitoring agreement that is executed between the consenting
roommate and the resident who requested the monitoring, or between their
authorized representatives, as appropriate.  The licensee, either through its
own activities or through a third-partys activities, will be required to
ensure that the conditions established in the agreement are followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a residents roommate or
the roommates authorized representative, as appropriate, refuses to consent to
the installation and use of an EMD in a private double occupancy room, or if
the licensee is unable to ensure compliance with the conditions on such
installation and use that are imposed by a consenting roommate or the
roommates authorized representative, the licensee will be required, within a
reasonable period of time, and to the extent practicable, to transfer the
resident requesting the installation of the device to a different private room,
in order to accommodate the residents request for private monitoring.  If a
request for private monitoring cannot be accommodated, the resident or
residents authorized representative may notify the DHS, which will be required
to make every reasonable attempt to timely transfer the resident to a group
home that can accommodate the request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All of the costs associated
with installation and maintenance of an EMD in a private room are to be paid by
the resident who requested the monitoring, or by the authorized representative
thereof.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any recordings produced by an
EMD installed in a private room will remain the property, and are to be
retained in the possession, of the resident or the authorized representative
who installed the EMD in the private room.  The bill would specify that a
licensee may not require a resident or the residents authorized
representative, as a condition of installing or using an EMD in the residents
private room, to turn over to the licensee, or to otherwise allow the licensee
to access or review, any recordings that are produced by the EMD in the private
room.  Whenever an EMD is proposed to be installed in a private double
occupancy room, the consenting roommate or authorized representative thereof,
as the case may be, may elect to provide that, as a condition of the
installation and ongoing use of the device in the room, the roommate and the
roommates authorized representative shall have the right and ability to access
and review any recordings that are produced by the EMD, upon request submitted
to the resident or authorized representative who owns the device.  This
condition, if elected by a consenting roommate or the roommates authorized
representative, is to be memorialized in the electronic monitoring agreement
that is executed pursuant to bills provisions.  Any such electronic monitoring
agreement will also be required to describe the procedures or protocols that
are to be used by the owner of the device to ensure that the consenting
roommate or the authorized representative thereof, as the case may be, is
provided with timely access to all relevant footage recorded by the device,
upon submission of a request therefor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Removal of EMDs from Private
Rooms</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A resident, or the authorized
representative thereof, who installs an EMD in a private single-occupancy room
or private double-occupancy room will be authorized to remove the device from
service at any time following its installation.  Any resident or authorized
representative who removes an EMD will be required to provide written notice of
such removal, to the licensee, within 48 hours after the device is removed from
service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever the roommate of a
resident, or the roommates authorized representative, revokes the roommates
previously granted consent for the use of EMDs in a private double-occupancy
room, the licensee will be required to transfer the resident who installed the
devices to another private room, if possible, or to another group home, if
necessary, to accommodate the residents preexisting request for electronic
monitoring.  (This is the same requirement that applies, under the bill,
whenever a roommate refuses to consent to, or imposes unattainable conditions
on, the use of an EMD in a private double-occupancy room).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><i>Additional Provisions</i></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a group
home licensee, when seeking to obtain consent from residents for electronic
monitoring, to comply with best practices that apply to professional
interactions or communications being undertaken with persons with developmental
disabilities, and particularly, with those persons who have difficulty with
communication or understanding.  The DHS would be authorized to impose any
additional consent or consent declination requirements that it deems to be
necessary.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any recordings produced by an EMD
in a group homes common areas will be the property of the group home licensee,
and are to be retained by the licensee for a period of 90 days.  Any consent
forms, consent declination forms, and notice of intent forms submitted under
the bill are to be retained by the group home for a period of time to be
determined by the DHS.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires each group
home employee to maintain the confidentiality of each recording that is
retained by the licensee pursuant to the bill, and it prohibits group home
employees from disclosing any such recording to any person who is not
authorized by law to receive or review it.  The bill similarly provides that
any authorized representative who installs an EMD in a private single-occupancy
or double-occupancy room, and any resident of a private double-occupancy room where
an EMD has been installed, will be required to maintain the confidentiality of
recordings produced by the installed device and will be prohibited from
disclosing any such recording to any person who is not authorized by law to
receive or review it.  The bill would specify that nothing in its provisions is
to be construed to prohibit a group home employee or resident, or a residents
authorized representative, from disclosing a recording, upon request or
otherwise, to a State or local law enforcement agency or officer or to any
other person who is authorized by law to investigate, prosecute, or take other
official remedial action to address instances of abuse, neglect, exploitation,
or other improper care or treatment occurring in the group home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 180 days after the
bills effective date, each group home will be required to develop and submit
to the division a written internal policy specifying the procedures and
protocols that are to be used by program staff when installing and utilizing
EMDs, when removing EMDs from the common areas, and when transferring, to
another room or group home, a resident whose request for private electronic
monitoring cannot be accommodated.  The internal EMD policy is also to:  1)
describe the make and model of EMDs that may be used within the group home; 2)
authorize the use of various types of EMDs in the home; and 3) indicate how the
licensee will ensure the proper installation, positioning, and use of EMDs in a
private double-occupancy room, in a manner that is consistent with all
conditions established by the consenting roommate, and establish protocols and
procedures to be used by the licensee when an EMD in a private double-occupancy
room makes an unauthorized recording of the roommate.<u>  </u>Finally, the
policy is to describe the procedures and protocols that will be used in the
review of footage recorded by EMDs in the group home.  Among other things, such
procedures and protocols are to identify the persons who will have access to
recorded footage, and the standards that are to identify, at a minimum, the
types of information that will constitute <span style='color:black'>incidents
of abuse, neglect, or exploitation, as are required to be submitted by a </span><span
style='color:black'>resident or the residents authorized representative in
order to receive authorization to access and review any footage that is
recorded by an electronic monitoring device in the common areas of the group
home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever a licensee receives
notice about a complaint, allegation, or reported incident of abuse, neglect,
or exploitation occurring within the group home, the licensee will be required
to forward to the DHS, for appropriate review, all potentially relevant footage
recorded by EMDs in:  1) the common areas of the group home; 2) the private
room of the resident who is the alleged victim of the abuse, neglect, or
exploitation; and 3) any other private room where the abuse, neglect, or
exploitation is alleged to have occurred.  Notwithstanding the provisions of the
bill to the contrary, any resident or authorized representative who is in
possession of potentially relevant footage related to an incident of abuse,
neglect, or exploitation will be required to turn over the pertinent recording
or recordings to the licensee, upon request, for transmission to the division. 
However, the bill specifies that nothing in its provisions may be deemed to
authorize a licensee to review, or to make copies of, any footage contained on those
private recordings, absent the express written consent of the resident or
authorized representative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any residential program that
fails to comply with the bills requirements will be subject to a penalty of
$5,000 for the first offense, and a penalty of $10,000 for the second or
subsequent offense, as well as an appropriate administrative penalty, the
amount of which is to be determined by the DHS.  However, a group home licensee
will not be subject to penalties or other disciplinary action for failing to
comply with the bills requirements if the group home licensee establishes,
through documentation or otherwise, that the group home is exempt from
compliance with the bills provisions related to the placement of EMDs in
unmonitored areas.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Human
Services, in consultation with the assistant commissioner of the Division of
Developmental Disabilities, will be required to annually report to the Governor
and Legislature on the implementation of the bills provisions.  Each annual
report is to include:  1) a list of group homes that are currently using EMDs
in the common areas; 2) a list of group homes that have not installed EMDs in
the common areas; 3) a list of group homes that have failed to install and use
EMDs in the common areas, despite the licensees receipt of uniform resident
consent, and an indication of the penalties imposed in response to such failures;
4) a list of group homes that are exempt from the bills provisions; 5) a list
of group homes that have authorized the use of EMDs in the private rooms of one
or more residents, and an indication of the number and percentage of private
single occupancy rooms and the number and percentage of private double
occupancy rooms in each such facility where EMDs are installed and being used;
6) a list of group homes that have removed EMDs from the common areas, pursuant
to the collective request of residents; 7) to the extent known, a list of group
homes that have failed to remove EMDs from the common areas, despite the
licensees receipt of a collective request from residents, and an indication of
the penalties imposed in response to such failures; and 8) recommendations for
legislative, executive, or other action that can be taken to improve compliance
with the bill or otherwise expand the consensual use of EMDs in group homes. 
The commissioner, in consultation with the assistant commissioners, will also be
required to post, at a publicly accessible location on the departments
Internet website, the various lists of group homes that the department has
produced for its annual reports.  Each list posted online is to be searchable
both by location and by name of group home.  The commissioner will be required
to annually update the website to ensure that each posted list contains the
most recently reported data.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the
commissioners annual reports, the bill requires the Ombudsman for Individuals
with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities and Their Families to include,
in each of the ombudsmans annual reports, a section evaluating the implementation
of the bill and providing recommendations for improvement.  The bill further
requires the commissioner, within five years of the bills effective date, to
provide the Governor and Legislature with a written report that:  1) identifies
best practices for the installation and use of EMDs under the bill; 2)
identifies best practices and provides recommendations regarding the obtaining
of informed consent for electronic monitoring under the bill; and 3) provides
recommendations for the implementation of new legislation, policies, protocols,
and procedures related to the use of EMDs in group homes. </p>
