the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed by law against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of

amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period,
together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of
the tax liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     One-Stop Career Center means
the same as that term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1992, c.43 (C.34:15D-3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualified employee means an
individual who is employed by a taxpayer in this State, which individual was
unemployed for at least 60 calendar days prior to the date of employment by the
taxpayer, and which individual has attended all required training services
provided through the One-Stop Career Center and achieved an industry valued or

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides corporation
business tax credits and gross income tax credits to employers that employ
qualified employees who received employment-related assistance through a One-Stop
Career Center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a taxpayer is
allowed a tax credit based on the salary and wages paid to each qualified
employee during the tax period.  However, the bill limits the amount of the tax
credit to $3,000 per qualified employee.  The bill requires the amount of the
tax credit to be prorated for each qualified employee who was not employed by
the taxpayer for the entire tax period.  The bill also provides that a taxpayer
can only claim the tax credit for the salary and wages paid to a qualified
employee who has been employed for a minimum period of 90 calendar days.  Any
amount of any unused tax credit may be carried forward to the seven tax periods
following the year for which the tax credit was issued, after which the tax
credit expires.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As defined in the bill,
qualified employee means an individual who is employed by a taxpayer in this
State, which individual was unemployed for at least 60 calendar days prior to
the date of employment by the taxpayer, and which individual has attended all required
training services provided through the One-Stop Career Center and achieved an
industry valued or nationally recognized credential during the period of
unemployment immediately preceding the date of employment by the taxpayer.  A
One-Stop Career Center means any of the facilities established, sponsored, or
designated by the State, a political subdivision of the State, and a Workforce
Investment Board in a local area to coordinate or make available State and local
programs providing employment and training services or other
employment-directed and workforce development programs and activities,
including job placement services, and any other similar facility as may be
established, sponsored, or designated at any later time to coordinate or make
available any of those programs, services, or activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the Director
of the Division of Taxation to determine the form and manner by which a
taxpayer can apply for the tax credit.  The director is also required to
collaborate with the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, as
appropriate, to determine the hiring and employment information to be included
by the taxpayer and to confirm that each qualified employee attended all required
training services provided through a One-Stop Career Center and achieved an
industry valued or nationally recognized credential during the period of
unemployment immediately preceding the date of employment by the taxpayer.</p>
