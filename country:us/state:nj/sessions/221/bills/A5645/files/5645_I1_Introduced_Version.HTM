<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  There is hereby
created, the Office of State Police Affairs in, but not of, the Department of the
Treasury.  Notwithstanding this allocation, the office shall be independent of
any supervision or control by any other State department, division, or office. 
The office shall be under the immediate supervision of a director, who shall be
a person qualified by training and experience to direct the work of the office. 
The director shall be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of
the Senate.  The director shall be appointed to a term of five years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notwithstanding the
provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the Director of the
Office of State Police Affairs shall have the power and duty to exercise supervision
over the Superintendent of State Police within the Department of Law and Public
Safety.  The Superintendent of State Police shall report to the director on a
regular basis, in a manner and frequency prescribed by the director. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  The Office of State
Police Affairs shall receive and investigate allegations concerning criminal
complaints or complaints of misconduct against a law enforcement officer.  In
exercising investigatory powers, the director shall also be empowered to
conduct evaluations, inspections, and other reviews as necessary.  The director
shall further be empowered to initiate investigations independent of any
complaint received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The director shall
conduct investigations in accordance with prevailing national and professional
standards, rules, and practices concerning investigations conducted in
governmental environments.  The director shall ensure that the office remains
in compliance with these standards, rules, and practices.  The director shall
provide a process for complaints to be submitted confidentially by members of
the general public and government employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In furtherance of an
investigation, the director may compel at a specific time and place, by
subpoena, the appearance and sworn testimony of any person whom the director
reasonably believes may be able to provide information relating to the
allegations concerning a criminal complaint or complaint of misconduct against
a law enforcement officer under investigation.  For this purpose, the director
is empowered to administer oaths, examine witnesses under oath, and compel any
person to produce at a specific time and place, by subpoena, any documents,
books, records, papers, objects, or other evidence that the director reasonably
believes may relate to the allegation under investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If any person to whom such a
subpoena is issued fails to appear or, having appeared, refuses to give
testimony, or fails to produce the books, papers, or other documents required,
the director may apply to the Superior Court, and the court may order the
person to appear and give testimony or produce the books, papers, or other
documents as applicable.  Any person failing to obey the courts order may be
punished by the court for contempt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A person compelled by
the director to appear and provide sworn testimony shall have the right to be
accompanied by counsel, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of the
witness rights.  A witness compelled to appear and testify shall be accorded
all due process rights. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Notwithstanding any
other provision under the laws of this State, a law enforcement officer under
investigation pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill) is prohibited from using privilege or work-product
protection to withhold information from the director.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     As used in this act,
law enforcement officer shall mean a law enforcement officer as defined in
P.L.2020, c.107 (C.52:17B-4.9) who is employed by the Division of State Police.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The Office of State
Police Affairs shall review all Division of State Police internal affairs investigations
and equal employment opportunity complaints, including dispositions and any
decision by the Division of State Police not to refer a complaint from a
citizen, or any other source, to the office, or its successor, to ascertain
whether the Division of State Police has complied with applicable standard operating
procedures, whether the outcomes of those investigations were supported by
evidence, whether any discipline imposed was appropriate and proportionate, and
to make recommendations to the Governor for appropriate disciplinary or remedial
action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Office of State
Police Affairs shall monitor, review, and evaluate the Division of State
Polices procedures for handling internal affairs investigations and equal
employment opportunity complaints, specifically to ensure that these complaints
do not unduly or improperly impact the eligibility of a promotion for a law
enforcement officer.  The Office of State Police Affairs shall oversee the
resolution of such complaints, ensuring they are resolved in a timely manner or
within the prescribed timeline of the Division of State Police. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Office of State
Police Affairs may initiate investigations independent of any complaint
received pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  The Director of the Office
of State Police Affairs shall have the power and duty to oversee the
appointment, employment, promotion, and removal of law enforcement officers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Office of State
Police Affairs shall conduct exit interviews, which may be remote or virtual,
with law enforcement officers who have separated from service.  A law
enforcement officer shall not be interviewed unless the law enforcement officer
is granted anonymity and fully consents to participate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The director shall annually
prepare and submit to the Governor and to the Legislature, pursuant to section
2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), a report that provides recommendations
concerning the recruitment, hiring, and promotions of law enforcement
officers.  The report shall also include findings from the exit interviews conducted
pursuant to subsection b. of this section.  The report shall be published on
the Internet website of the Office of State Police Affairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the Office
of State Police Affairs (OSPA).  The director will be appointed to a five-year
term by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate and is required
to be qualified by training and experience to direct the work of the office. 
The director will operate independently, without supervision or control by any
other State department, division, or office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the Director
of OSPA will have the power and duty to exercise supervision over the
Superintendent of State Police within the Department of Law and Public Safety. 
The Superintendent of State Police is to report to the director on a regular
basis, in a manner and frequency prescribed by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the director is
to receive and investigate allegations concerning criminal complaints or
complaints of misconduct against law enforcement officers employed by the
Division of State Police.  To this end, the director is to provide a
confidential process for submitting complaints by both the public and
government employees.  The director is responsible for organizing the office,
hiring staff, and engaging consultants as needed, using a fair, competitive
process to ensure independence and effectiveness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of this
bill, a law enforcement officer who is under investigation for allegations
concerning a criminal complaint or complaint of misconduct is prohibited from
using privilege or work-product protection to withhold information from the
director.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill grants the director
authority to compel testimony and request documents through subpoenas,
requiring that all investigations adhere to national and professional
standards. Additionally, the director can request information, resources, and
assistance from any State department or agency to fulfill its duties.  The
director is also authorized to collaborate with other State oversight entities,
such as the State Auditor, the State Commission of Investigation, the State
Comptroller, and the State Inspector General, and may participate in joint
investigations with these agencies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, OSPA is to
review all Division of State Police internal affairs investigations and equal
employment opportunity complaints to ascertain whether the Division of State
Police has complied with applicable standard operating procedures, whether the
outcomes of those investigations were supported by evidence, whether any
discipline imposed was appropriate and proportionate, and to make
recommendations to the Governor for appropriate disciplinary or remedial
action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the OSPA is to
monitor, review, and evaluate the Division of State Polices procedures for
handling internal affairs investigations and equal employment opportunity
complaints, specifically to ensure that these complaints do not unduly or
improperly impact the eligibility of a promotion for a law enforcement officer. 
The OSPA is to oversee the resolution of such complaints, ensuring they are
resolved in a timely manner or within the prescribed timeline of the Division
of State Police. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the director will
have the power and duty to oversee the appointment, employment, promotion, and
removal of law enforcement officers employed by the Division of State Police. 
Additionally, the bill requires exit interviews to be conducted.  The director
is to annually prepare and submit to the Governor, and to the Legislature, a
report that provides recommendations concerning the recruitment, hiring, and
promotions of law enforcement officers.  The report is to also include findings
from the exit interviews required under the bill.  The report is to be published
on OSPAs website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides the director
the discretion to decline certain investigations.  In the course of conducting
investigations, evaluations, inspections, and other reviews, the director may
also refer matters for further civil and administrative action to an
appropriate authority. Whenever a criminal complaint is made against a law
enforcement officer employed by the Division of State Police, the director is
required to notify the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability.  Additionally,
the director is responsible for ensuring that such criminal complaints are
documented as part of the law enforcement officers personnel file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, all criminal
complaints made against law enforcement officers employed by the Division of
State Police are to be managed, investigated, and prosecuted by OSPA.  Any
attorney appointed by the director to prosecute a criminal complaint is to
serve as a State prosecutor with the same powers and authority as a county
prosecutor, including the ability to bring criminal charges, represent the State
in court, and exercise all other powers and responsibilities typically granted
to county prosecutors under the laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of the
bill, the director is required to maintain detailed records of complaints and
outcomes and may disclose information as needed while safeguarding the
confidentiality of ongoing investigations.  The director is to meet at least
twice annually with other State oversight bodies to coordinate efforts, share
information, and prevent duplication of work.  After concluding an
investigation, the director is to submit a report with findings and
recommendations to the Governor and Legislature, which is also to be published
online for public access. </p>
