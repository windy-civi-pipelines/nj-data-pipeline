(cf: P.L.2012, c.1, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Current law requires each school district to adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation or bullying.  Under these policies, after an incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying has been reported to the principal, he must inform the parents and guardians of all students involved in the alleged incident.  This bill specifies that the policy must also include a provision that requires the principal to make a preliminary determination as to whether a reported incident or complaint is a report of an act of harassment, intimidation, or bullying as those terms are defined by law, prior to initiating an investigation. The policy must also provide that the principal hold a separate meeting with the parents or guardians of each student involved in the alleged incident within seven days of informing them of the alleged incident, in order to assist the principal in making the preliminary determination.  The bill also provides that the investigation of the alleged incident must be completed no later than 30 days from the date the written report of the incident is provided to the principal.  Current law requires the investigation to be completed no later than 10 days from the date the written report is provided.  This bill extends the time frame to allow a sufficient time period for the principal to hold the meetings with the parents or guardians and make a preliminary determination regarding the alleged incident.
