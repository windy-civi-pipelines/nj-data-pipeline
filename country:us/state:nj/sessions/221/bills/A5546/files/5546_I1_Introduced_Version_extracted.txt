STATEMENT This bill authorizes the Capital City Redevelopment Corporation (CCRC) to issue grants for projects that benefit the Capital City District.  Additionally, the bill removes the current statutory requirement that 65 percent of the funds be recovered through repayment. The CCRC needs general authority to issue grants with funds other than those in the dedicated Grant and Loan Fund.  This is particularly necessary for assistance with current and future CCRC projects. Without the granting of the authority for the CCRC to issue grants, the CCRC will be limited in its ability to provide grant financing for these projects. Additionally, the existing statutory requirement that at least 65 percent of the monies appropriated to the fund is recovered and is to continue to be available for financing limits the attractiveness of programs developed by CCRC and therefore impairs participation from Trenton businesses and organizations.  The economic distress in the Capital District is significant and to develop programs that meet the current challenges CCRC needs the ability to determine an appropriate amount of recovery and repayment per project or program.
