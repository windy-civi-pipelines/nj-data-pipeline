CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning emergency shelters for the homeless and supplementing P.L.1983, c.530 (C.55:14K-1 et seq.).

The provisions of this section shall not apply to shelters for victims of domestic violence. 2.    A shelter for the homeless, except a shelter for victims of domestic violence, which is subject to regulation by the Department of Community Affairs pursuant to N.J.A.C.5:15-1.1 et seq., shall cooperate in providing any necessary information to the database, as determined by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, the Department of Community Affairs, and the Department of Human Services, as a condition of being eligible to receive funding for the shelter from the Department of Community Affairs and the Department of Human Services. 3.    This act shall take effect on the 60th day following enactment.
