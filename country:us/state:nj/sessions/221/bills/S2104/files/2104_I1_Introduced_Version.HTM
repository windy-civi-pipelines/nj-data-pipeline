<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-302) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The New Jersey Supreme
Court, through its rulings in South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 67
N.J. 151 (1975) and South Burlington County NAACP v. Mount Laurel, 92 N.J. 158
(1983), has determined that every municipality in a growth area has a
constitutional obligation to provide through its land use regulations a
realistic opportunity for a fair share of its region's present and prospective
needs for housing for low and moderate income families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the second Mount
Laurel ruling, the Supreme Court stated that the determination of the methods
for satisfying this constitutional obligation &quot;is better left to the
Legislature,&quot; that the court has &quot;always preferred legislative to
judicial action in their field,&quot; and that the judicial role in upholding
the Mount Laurel doctrine &quot;could decrease as a result of legislative and
executive action.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The interest of all
citizens, including low and moderate income families in need of affordable
housing, and the needs of the workforce, would be best served by a
comprehensive planning and implementation response to this constitutional
obligation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    There are a number of
essential ingredients to a comprehensive planning and implementation response,
including the establishment of reasonable fair share housing guidelines and
standards, the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>initial<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> determination
of fair share by officials at the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>municipal<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>State</u>
level <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and
the<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>,
municipal</u> preparation of a municipal housing element, State review of the <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>local fair
share study and<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
housing element <u>and formation of a plan to achieve the municipal fair share</u>,
and continuous State funding for low and moderate income housing to replace the
federal housing subsidy programs which have been almost completely eliminated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The State can maximize
the number of low and moderate income units provided in New Jersey by allowing
its municipalities to adopt appropriate phasing schedules for meeting their
fair share, so long as the municipalities permit a timely achievement of an
appropriate fair share of the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>regional<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> need for low
and moderate income housing as required by the Mt. Laurel I and II opinions and
other relevant court decisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The State can also
maximize the number of low and moderate income units by creating new affordable
housing and by rehabilitating existing, but substandard, housing in the State. 
Because the Legislature has determined, pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46
(C.52:27D-329.1 et al.), that it is no longer appropriate or in harmony with
the Mount Laurel doctrine to permit the transfer of the fair share obligations
among municipalities within a housing region, it is necessary and appropriate
to create a new program to create new affordable housing and to foster the
rehabilitation of existing, but substandard, housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Since the urban areas
are vitally important to the State, construction, conversion and rehabilitation
of housing in our urban centers should be encouraged.  However, the provision
of housing in urban areas must be balanced with the need to provide housing
throughout the State for the free mobility of citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The Supreme Court of New
Jersey in its Mount Laurel decisions demands that municipal land use
regulations affirmatively afford a reasonable opportunity for a variety and
choice of housing including low and moderate cost housing, to meet the needs of
people desiring to live there.  While provision for the actual construction of
that housing by municipalities is not required, they are encouraged but not
mandated to expend their own resources to help provide low and moderate income
housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Certain amendments to
the enabling act of the Council on Affordable Housing are necessary to provide
guidance to the council to ensure consistency with the legislative intent,
while at the same time clarifying the limitations of the council in its
rulemaking.  Although the court has remarked in several decisions that the
Legislature has granted the council considerable deference in its rulemaking,
the Legislature retains its power and obligation to clarify and amend the
enabling act from which the council derives its rulemaking power, from time to
time, in order to better guide the council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     The Legislature finds
that the use of regional contribution agreements, which permits municipalities
to transfer a certain portion of their fair share housing obligation outside of
the municipal borders, should no longer be utilized as a mechanism for the
creation of affordable housing by the council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2008, c.46, s.4)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 4 of P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-304) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    As used in P.L.1985,
c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     &quot;Council&quot;
means the Council on Affordable Housing established in P.L.1985, c.222

locating within a State or municipality or locality and halts non-residential and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require that
affordable housing obligations be calculated and administered at the State
level.  Affordable housing is an issue of Statewide concern and importance.  It
is also a highly complex issue that requires technical expertise, often ends up
in litigation, and is expensive to administer.  This bill would eliminate the current
municipality-to-municipality patchwork approach to affordable housing.  The
bill would centralize administration of this issue in the State agency with the
necessary Statewide policy perspective and technical expertise, and which can
serve as a cost-effective, fair forum to address this issue  the Council on
Affordable Housing (the council).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, affordable housing
need is calculated at the regional level and fair share plans are created by
municipalities.  Under the bill, the council would calculate the affordable
housing need of the entire State.  The council would then select which
municipalities will have a role to play in fulfilling this Statewide need and
will assign them a fair share of this obligation.  Such municipality would then
submit a housing element that provides basic information on the current housing
stock and properties suited for affordable housing development that could
satisfy the municipal fair share.  After receipt of the housing element, the
bill requires the council to grant the municipality a substantive certification
that shields it from exclusionary zoning suits.  The council would next draft a
fair share plan for the municipality that directs the municipality on how to
satisfy its fair share obligation.  The municipality would be required to adopt
a fair share ordinance effectuating that fair share plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The council would be required
to engage in a mediation process if an objection is made to its fair share plan
for a municipality.  Any exclusionary zoning suit to a fair share plan for a
municipality would have to be brought against the council, with the
municipality having the option to be a party in the litigation. </p>
