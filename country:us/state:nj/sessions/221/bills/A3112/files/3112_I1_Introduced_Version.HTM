the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.1970,
c.22 (C.17:27A-1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Definitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in P.L.1970, c. 22
(C.17:27A-1 et seq.), the following terms shall have the respective meanings
hereinafter set forth, unless the context shall otherwise require:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     An
&quot;affiliate&quot; of, or person &quot;affiliated&quot; with, a specific
person, is a person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with,
the person specified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The term
&quot;commissioner&quot; shall mean the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance
or the commissioner's deputies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The term
&quot;control&quot; (including the terms &quot;controlling,&quot;
&quot;controlled by&quot; and &quot;under common control with&quot;) means the
possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction
of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of
voting securities, <u>the holding of proxies,</u> by contract other than a
commercial contract for goods or nonmanagement services, or otherwise, unless
the power is the result of an official position with or corporate office held
by the person. Control shall be presumed to exist if any person, directly or
indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies
representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of any other person, <u>or
holds or controls sufficient proxies to elect 10% or more of the board of
directors of the other person,</u> provided that no such presumption of control
shall of itself relieve any person so presumed to have control from any
requirement of P.L.1970, c. 22 (C.17:27A-1 et seq.). This presumption may be
rebutted by a showing made in the manner provided by subsection j. of section 3
of P.L.1970, c. 22 (C.17:27A-3) that control does not exist in fact. The
commissioner may determine, after furnishing all persons in interest notice and
an opportunity to be heard, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and
making<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>that a person directly or indirectly, alone or pursuant to an oral or a
written agreement, arrangement or understanding with one or more other persons,
exercises influence over the management or policies of an insurer that it is
necessary or appropriate for the protection of policyholders of the insurer or
in the public interest that the person or persons be deemed to control the
company.  The commissioner shall make</u> specific findings of fact to support <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>such<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the</u>
determination, that control exists in fact, notwithstanding the absence of a
presumption to that effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    An &quot;insurance
holding company system&quot; consists of two or more affiliated persons, one or
more of which is an insurer. A mutual holding company system resulting from a
mutualization and reorganization of a health service corporation pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.2020, c.145 (C.17:48E-46.5), shall be an insurance holding
company system pursuant to P.L.1970, c. 22 (C.17:27A-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The term
&quot;insurer&quot; means any person or persons, corporation, partnership or
company authorized by the laws of this State to transact the business of
insurance or to operate a health maintenance organization in this State, except
that it shall not include agencies, authorities or instrumentalities of the
United States, its possessions and territories, the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico, the District of Columbia, or a state or political subdivision of a state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A &quot;person&quot; is
an individual, a corporation, a limited liability company, partnership, an
association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization,
any similar entity or any combination of the foregoing acting in concert.</p>

P.L.1993, c. 241).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    A &quot;subsidiary&quot;
of a specified person is an affiliate controlled by such person directly, or
indirectly through one or more intermediaries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The term &quot;voting
security&quot; shall include any security convertible into or evidencing a
right to acquire a voting security.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     &quot;Acquisition&quot;
means any agreement, arrangement or activity, the consummation of which results
in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, and
includes but is not limited to the acquisition of voting securities, and
assets, and bulk reinsurance and mergers.</p>

person filing the statement to such other persons as may be designated by the
commissioner.  The hearing shall, at the commissioner's discretion, be
conducted by the commissioner or his designee who shall report to the
commissioner and advise him on the nature of the matter delegated.  The
commissioner shall make a determination or issue an order, based upon that

person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest
may be affected thereby shall have the right to present evidence, examine and
cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and in connection

any voting securities <u>or proxies</u> in violation of this chapter or any
rule, regulation or order issued by the commissioner hereunder, the Superior
Court may, on such notice as the court deems appropriate, upon the application

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes certain
changes to the law concerning insurance holding companies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill adds a distinct
presumption of control when a person solicits proxies for the purpose of
electing directors representing 10 percent or more of the board members and
adds a definition of own or owned to include all voting securities
underlying convertible securities, options, securities futures contracts, and
aggregating shares owned by persons acting in concert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill adds to the law
additional circumstances under which a person is required to file information
with the Department of Banking and Insurance and obtain approval and requires
additional information to be included in the filing.  The bill clarifies that
the purpose of these provisions is to enable the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance to review any acquisition of control of a domestic insurer or of any
other person controlling a domestic insurer in order to determine whether or
not the acquisition of control would be adverse to the public interest or
protection of the existing and future policyholders of the company or is being
sought by persons who would utilize such control adversely to the public
interest or protection of policyholders, and to enable the commissioner to make
the findings required pursuant to the law.</p>
