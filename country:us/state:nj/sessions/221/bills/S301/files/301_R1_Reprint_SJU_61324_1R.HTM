<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Except as otherwise
provided under sections 4 and 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-18 and C.2A:162-19)
concerning a hearing on pretrial detention, a court shall make, pursuant to
this section, a pretrial release decision for an eligible defendant without
unnecessary delay, but in no case later than 48 hours after the eligible
defendant's commitment to jail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The court shall order
the pretrial release of the eligible defendant on personal recognizance or on
the execution of an unsecured appearance bond when, after considering all the
circumstances, the Pretrial Services Program's risk assessment and
recommendations on conditions of release prepared pursuant to section 11 of
P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-25), and any information that may be provided by a
prosecutor or the eligible defendant, the court finds that the release would
reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required,
the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, and that the
eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal
justice process. </p>

shall not commit any offense during the period of release; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the eligible defendant

condition or conditions of a pretrial release ordered by the court pursuant to
this paragraph shall be the least restrictive condition, or combination of
conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the eligible
defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of
any other person or the community, and that the eligible defendant will not
obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process, which may include
that the eligible defendant:</p>

a designated person, who agrees to assume supervision and to report any
violation of a release condition to the court, if the designated person is able
