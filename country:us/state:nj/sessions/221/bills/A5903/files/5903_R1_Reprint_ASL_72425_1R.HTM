(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), an employee commencing employment on or after the effective date P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) who does not waive coverage shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the employee fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the employee, and the employees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The employee shall remain enrolled in the plan selected by the employee at the annual open enrollment for each plan year, provided that the employee during this period may waive coverage as an employee and select and change the type of coverage received under the plan following a qualifying life event, in accordance with the program regulations. (2) For the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a retiree who is not Medicare-eligible, shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the retiree fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the retiree, and the retirees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) as a retiree, if the retiree does not waive coverage.  The retiree shall remain enrolled in that plan for each plan year until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.  The retiree who becomes eligible for Medicare shall no longer be eligible for enrollment in the plan, except that any dependent of the retiree who is not eligible for Medicare may remain eligible for coverage. (3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection e. of this section, selection of a plan shall be at the sole discretion of the employee or retiree who is not Medicare-eligible. g.  Parties to a collective negotiations agreement shall be permitted to enter into binding agreements to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. h.  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, for each plan year, the State Health Benefits Commission shall annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the commission shall compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission shall meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year shall be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in this section. (2) As used in this section: Baseline premium means the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. Blended premium means and includes the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage. "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor. (3) Every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission shall determine whether the blended premium of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium.  If so, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator shall be applied to employee contribution rates, pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (4) If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates shall be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (5) If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures. If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates shall be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator shall be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (6) The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in subsection b. of section 55 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.52:14-17.27b). 5. (New section) a.  Within 180 days following the enactment of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when a public employer other than the State does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program 1, if the public employer does not offer a plan substantially similar in design to the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO Plan1 and its employees are enrolled in medical and prescription drug plans with higher annual premiums than the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan 1[or higher employee contribution rates than for the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as set forth in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)]1, upon request of the collective negotiations representative who represents those employees, the public employer other than the State and the collective negotiations representative shall negotiate over offering employees a health care plan substantially similar in design to the SHBP 2019 Unity PPO at substantially similar contribution rates 1and annual premiums1, offering employees incentives to select plans with lower costs, or, in the alternative, enrolling in the State Health Benefits Program.  Modifications to the health benefit provisions of collective negotiations agreements or to health benefit plans, including prescription drug plans, offered to employees, shall only be by mutual agreement between the collective negotiations representative and the local employer.  Upon request of the parties, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall assign a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute.  If mediation is unsuccessful and the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, there shall be no changes to health benefits provided pursuant to a collective negotiations agreement, practice, or policy. b.  Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, local government entities that do not participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be permitted to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts pursuant to collective negotiations agreements to offset Internal Revenue Service eligible employee out-of-pocket costs related to eligible medical and prescription drug services, to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. c.  The provisions of P.L. , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be construed to interfere with or require changes to the health plans offered by a public employer other than the State that does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program. 6.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, within one year from the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any employer other than the State shall be required to make a determination as to whether to participate in the State Health Benefits Program.  Any employer other than the State which elects to participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be required to remain enrolled in the program for a minimum period of two consecutive plan years following the election to participate in the program.  Any employer other than the State that elects not to participate in the State health Benefits Program shall be prohibited from enrolling in the program for a minimum of two consecutive plan years. 7.  This act shall take effect immediately.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection e. of this section, selection of a plan shall be at the sole discretion of the employee or retiree who is not Medicare-eligible. g.  Parties to a collective negotiations agreement shall be permitted to enter into binding agreements to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. h.  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, for each plan year, the State Health Benefits Commission shall annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the commission shall compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission shall meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year shall be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in this section. (2) As used in this section: Baseline premium means the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. Blended premium means and includes the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage. "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor. (3) Every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission shall determine whether the blended premium of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium.  If so, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator shall be applied to employee contribution rates, pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (4) If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates shall be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (5) If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures. If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates shall be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator shall be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (6) The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in subsection b. of section 55 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.52:14-17.27b). 5.
