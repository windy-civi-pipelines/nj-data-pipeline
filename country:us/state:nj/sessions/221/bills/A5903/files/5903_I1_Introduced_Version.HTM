(7) For the plan year that commences next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and for each plan year thereafter, the contributions required pursuant to this subsection may be modified through collective negotiations agreements entered into between the employers who participate in the State Health Benefits Program and their employees.  The contributions required pursuant to this subsection shall become part of the parties' collective negotiations agreement and shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a manner similar to other negotiable items between the parties.  Negotiations concerning contributions for health care benefits shall be conducted as if the contributions required pursuant to this subsection were included in the prior contract.  The contribution calculation based on the percentage of base salary set forth in this subsection may be modified or a new method of contribution calculation other than a percentage of salary may be provided for in accordance with a collective negotiations agreement, provided that the parties to the collective negotiations agreement agree on the new or modified method of contribution calculation. e.  Prior to the first day of January next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the program, through the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury, shall provide for an enrollment period during which all employees who commenced employment prior to the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If an employee fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the employee, and the employees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). During the enrollment period, any person who is enrolled in a plan offered by the program and who is paying the full cost of health care benefits coverage shall also be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If a person fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the person, and the persons dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). f.  (1) Beginning on the first day of January next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), an employee commencing employment on or after the effective date P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) who does not waive coverage shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the employee fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the employee, and the employees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The employee shall remain enrolled in the plan selected by the employee at the annual open enrollment for each plan year, provided that the employee during this period may waive coverage as an employee and select and change the type of coverage received under the plan following a qualifying life event, in accordance with the program regulations. (2) For the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a retiree who is not Medicare-eligible, shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the retiree fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the retiree, and the retirees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) as a retiree, if the retiree does not waive coverage.  The retiree shall remain enrolled in that plan for each plan year until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.  The retiree who becomes eligible for Medicare shall no longer be eligible for enrollment in the plan, except that any dependent of the retiree who is not eligible for Medicare may remain eligible for coverage. (3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection e. of this section, selection of a plan shall be at the sole discretion of the employee or retiree who is not Medicare-eligible. g.  Parties to a collective negotiations agreement shall be permitted to enter into binding agreements to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. h.  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, for each plan year, the State Health Benefits Commission shall annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the commission shall compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission shall meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year shall be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in this section. (2) As used in this section: Baseline premium means the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. Blended premium means and includes the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage. "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor. (3) Every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission shall determine whether the blended premium of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium.  If so, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator shall be applied to employee contribution rates, pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (4) If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates shall be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (5) If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures.  If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates shall be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator shall be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (6) The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in subsection b. of section 55 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.52:14-17.27b). 5.  (New section) a.  Within 180 days following the enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when a public employer other than the State does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program and its employees are enrolled in medical and prescription drug plans with higher annual premiums than the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan or higher employee contribution rates than for the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as set forth in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), upon request of the collective negotiations representative who represents those employees, the public employer other than the State and the collective negotiations representative shall negotiate over offering employees a health care plan substantially similar in design to the SHBP 2019 Unity PPO at substantially similar contribution rates, offering employees incentives to select plans with lower costs, or, in the alternative, enrolling in the State Health Benefits Program.  Modifications to the health benefit provisions of collective negotiations agreements or to health benefit plans, including prescription drug plans, offered to employees, shall only be by mutual agreement between the collective negotiations representative and the local employer.  Upon request of the parties, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall assign a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute.  If mediation is unsuccessful and the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, there shall be no changes to health benefits provided pursuant to a collective negotiations agreement, practice, or policy. b.  Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, local government entities that do not participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be permitted to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts pursuant to collective negotiations agreements to offset Internal Revenue Service eligible employee out-of-pocket costs related to eligible medical and prescription drug services, to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. c.  The provisions of P.L. , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be construed to interfere with or require changes to the health plans offered by a public employer other than the State that does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program. 6.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, within one year from the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any employer other than the State shall be required to make a determination as to whether to participate in the State Health Benefits Program.  Any employer other than the State which elects to participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be required to remain enrolled in the program for a minimum period of two consecutive plan years following the election to participate in the program.  Any employer other than the State that elects not to participate in the State health Benefits Program shall be prohibited from enrolling in the program for a minimum of two consecutive plan years. 7.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to the State Health Benefits Program (SHBP). State Health Benefits Commission The bill revises the structure of the State Health Benefits Commission (SHBC) to include 11 members as follows: (1) the State Treasurer; the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance; the Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission, or their designees, who will serve ex officio; (2) two members appointed by the Governor; (3) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (4) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the second largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (5) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the public employee organization with the third largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (6) a member appointed by the public employee organization that is not affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO, that represents the largest number of employees in the State Health Benefits Program who are not represented by an employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO; (7) a member appointed by the public employee organization that is not affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO, that represents the second largest number of employees in the State Health Benefits Program who are not represented by an employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO; and (8) a member, who will serve as chairperson, appointed by the Governor from among three persons nominated jointly by at least eight of the members appointed. The bill specifies that the SHBC will establish the health benefits program and, with respect to plan design, the SHBC will have responsibility for, and authority over, the various health care benefits plans and components of those plans, including medical benefits, prescription drug benefits, dental, vision, and any other health benefits, offered and administered by the SHBP and will have the authority to create, modify, or terminate any plan or component of any health care benefits plan, at its sole discretion.  The bill empowers the SHBC to obtain certain information necessary to make informed decisions and to enter into contracts with third-party administrators and consultants. The SHBC will also be required to follow the advice and guidance of the program actuary when developing plan designs for the health plans provided by the program.  Whenever the program actuary advises that the anticipated costs of one or more of the plans under the program is likely to exceed the rate of medical or prescription drug inflation for a given plan year, as determined by the program actuary based upon relevant indices and information, the commission will be required to take such actions as may be necessary to appropriately mange such costs and ensure the continued viability of the program, subject to established processes including, but not limited to, collective negotiations agreements. Actuarial Report Additionally, the bill requires that within 30 calendar days after the end of the first full plan year next following the enactment and implementation of the bill, the States actuary for the SHBP will issue an actuarial report concerning the SHBP health plans.  The report must include the State and public entities other than the State that participate and do not participate in the State Health Benefits Program, inclusive of retirees who are not Medicare-eligible paid for by the State.  The report must make recommendations addressing the cost of higher priced medications, including, but not limited to, glucagon-like peptide-1 drugs utilized for diabetes, weight loss, and cardiovascular disease. The bill requires the commission to review and consider any prescription medications that have been newly approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration on a quarterly basis and must review such information when considering updates to the prescription drug formularies for each of the plans in the SHBP and those described in the bill. Plan Design Committee and Arbitration Process This bill eliminates the SHBP Plan Design Committee and transfers the powers and functions of the Plan Design Committee to the newly organized SHBC.  With the elimination of the SHBP Plan Design Committee, the bill ends the use of a super conciliator by the SHBP to resolve deadlocked matters before the SHBP Plan Design Committee.  Instead, the bill requires all decisions before the commission to be resolved within 30 days from the date such decisions are placed before the commission.  After the 30 day period, if a decision on a matter before the commission is not reached, or if the commission remains at an impasse, the commission will select a neutral third-party arbitrator with subject matter expertise who will attempt to assist the commission in reaching a voluntary resolution on the matter. The bill requires the arbitrator to promptly schedule investigatory proceedings to investigate and acquire all relevant information regarding the committees failure to render a decision; discuss with the members of the committee their differences, and utilize means and mechanisms, including but not limited to requiring 24-hour per day negotiations, until a voluntary settlement is reached, and provide recommendations to resolve the members differences; and institute any other non-binding procedures deemed appropriate by the arbitrator.  If the actions taken by the arbitrator fail to resolve the dispute after 30 days, the arbitrator will issue a final binding decision, which will be provided to the commission promptly and made available to the public within 10 days thereafter. Medical Claims Review This bill also requires SHBC to require that the third-party medical claims reviewer will annually review at least 33 percent of in-network claims and 33 percent of out-of-network claims to ensure that the SHBP is being properly charged for in-network and out-of-network provider services.  The claims review program will annually review at least 33 percent of claims reimbursed to providers located in New York and Pennsylvania, with a focus on claims resulting from higher cost services, including, but not limited to, services provided by specialty physicians.  The State Treasurer is required to adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section.  The regulations must specify any additional quantitative and qualitative criteria that will apply to the claims review requirements established by this section. SHBP-Local Plans The bill requires that the SHBP offer five plans that provide medical and prescription drug benefits for local government employees of employers other than the State that participate in the SHBP and retirees who are not Medicare-eligible, and their dependents, if any.  However, these provisions will not increase the contribution rates of employees who have 20 or more years of creditable service in one or more State or locally-administered retirement systems on the effective date of the bill, or retirees who retired on or before that effective date. The five plans will be: (1) the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission effective July 1, 2019, except that the commission and employers other than the State will require employee contribution rates as set forth in the bill, which will be the default plan for employees and retirees who fail to affirmatively select a plan during the open enrollment period; (2) the SHBP Tiered Network plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date of this bill, except that the commission and employers other than the State will require employee contribution rates to equate to 75 percent of the rates paid by employees of employers other than the State enrolled in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan pursuant to the bill; (3) the SHBP PPO 2030 plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date of this bill; (4) the SHBP PPO 2035 plan offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date this bill; and (5) the NJ Gold plan. The NJ Gold plan will be developed by the SHBC in a manner which does not require employee contributions in the form of withholding from the employees base salary, or the retirement allowance of retirees.  The NJ Gold plan will provide benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 80 percent of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided under the plan. The bill provides for the escalation or de-escalation of employee contribution rates depending on the anticipated increase or decrease in premium costs, as applicable. The bill directs he State Health Benefits Commission to annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of the bill, and to compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission will meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year will be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in the bill. Under the bill, every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission will determine whether the blended premium, defined in the bill as the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage, of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium, defined in the bill as the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. If so, the commission will determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator will be applied to employee contribution rates. If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates will be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission will determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures.  If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates will be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator will be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions will be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions will not be subject to the commissions dispute resolution procedures. Non-SHBP-Local Employers The bill also requires that within 180 days following the enactment this bill, when a public employer other than the State does not participate in the SHBP and its employees are enrolled in medical and prescription drug plans with higher annual premiums than the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan or higher employee contribution rates than for the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as set forth in the bill, upon request of the collective negotiations representative who represents those employees, the public employer other than the State and the collective negotiations representative will negotiate over offering employees a health care plan substantially similar in design to the 2019 Unity PPO at substantially similar contribution rates, offering employees incentives to select plans with lower costs, or, in the alternative, enrolling in the SHBP.  Modifications to the health benefit provisions of collective negotiations agreements or to health benefit plans, including prescription drug plans, offered to employees, will only be by mutual agreement between the collective negotiations representative and the local employer.  Upon request of the parties, the Public Employment Relations Commission will assign a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute. If mediation is unsuccessful and the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, there will be no changes to health benefits provided pursuant to a collective negotiations agreement, practice, or policy. The bill clarifies that local government entities that do not participate in the SHBP will be permitted to utilize health reimbursement arrangements pursuant to collective negotiations agreements to offset IRS eligible employee out-of-pocket costs related to eligible medical and prescription drug services.  The bill also specifies that its provisions will not be construed to interfere with or require changes to the health plans offered by a public employer other than the State that does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program. Local Participation in SHBP The bill also requires that, within one year from the effective date of this bill, any employer other than the State will be required to make a determination as to whether or not to participate in the SHBP.  Any employer other than the State which elects to participate in the SHBP will be required to remain enrolled in the program for a minimum period of two consecutive plan years following the election to participate in the program.  Any employer other than the State that elects not to participate in the SHBP will be prohibited from enrolling in the program for a minimum of two consecutive plan years.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), an employee commencing employment on or after the effective date P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) who does not waive coverage shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the employee fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the employee, and the employees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The employee shall remain enrolled in the plan selected by the employee at the annual open enrollment for each plan year, provided that the employee during this period may waive coverage as an employee and select and change the type of coverage received under the plan following a qualifying life event, in accordance with the program regulations. (2) For the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), a retiree who is not Medicare-eligible, shall be required to affirmatively select one of the plans specified in subsection b. of this section.  If the retiree fails to affirmatively select a plan during this enrollment period, the program shall enroll the retiree, and the retirees dependents, if any, in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan for the plan year beginning on the first day of January next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) as a retiree, if the retiree does not waive coverage.  The retiree shall remain enrolled in that plan for each plan year until the retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.  The retiree who becomes eligible for Medicare shall no longer be eligible for enrollment in the plan, except that any dependent of the retiree who is not eligible for Medicare may remain eligible for coverage. (3) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection or subsection e. of this section, selection of a plan shall be at the sole discretion of the employee or retiree who is not Medicare-eligible. g.  Parties to a collective negotiations agreement shall be permitted to enter into binding agreements to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. h.  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, for each plan year, the State Health Benefits Commission shall annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  In addition, the commission shall compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission shall meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year shall be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in this section. (2) As used in this section: Baseline premium means the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. Blended premium means and includes the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage. "Consumer Price Index" means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island Metropolitan Area, All Items (1982-84=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor. (3) Every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission shall determine whether the blended premium of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium.  If so, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator shall be applied to employee contribution rates, pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. (4) If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates shall be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (5) If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission shall determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures.  If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates shall be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator shall be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. (6) The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of this subsection shall not be subject to the dispute resolution procedures set forth in subsection b. of section 55 of P.L.2011, c.78 (C.52:14-17.27b). 5.  (New section) a.  Within 180 days following the enactment of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when a public employer other than the State does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program and its employees are enrolled in medical and prescription drug plans with higher annual premiums than the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan or higher employee contribution rates than for the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as set forth in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), upon request of the collective negotiations representative who represents those employees, the public employer other than the State and the collective negotiations representative shall negotiate over offering employees a health care plan substantially similar in design to the SHBP 2019 Unity PPO at substantially similar contribution rates, offering employees incentives to select plans with lower costs, or, in the alternative, enrolling in the State Health Benefits Program.  Modifications to the health benefit provisions of collective negotiations agreements or to health benefit plans, including prescription drug plans, offered to employees, shall only be by mutual agreement between the collective negotiations representative and the local employer.  Upon request of the parties, the Public Employment Relations Commission shall assign a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute.  If mediation is unsuccessful and the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, there shall be no changes to health benefits provided pursuant to a collective negotiations agreement, practice, or policy. b.  Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, local government entities that do not participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be permitted to provide employees with access to health care reimbursement arrangements, health care savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts pursuant to collective negotiations agreements to offset Internal Revenue Service eligible employee out-of-pocket costs related to eligible medical and prescription drug services, to the full extent permitted by federal law including statutes, regulations, and policy guidance of the Internal Revenue Service. c.  The provisions of P.L. , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be construed to interfere with or require changes to the health plans offered by a public employer other than the State that does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program. 6.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, within one year from the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any employer other than the State shall be required to make a determination as to whether to participate in the State Health Benefits Program.  Any employer other than the State which elects to participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall be required to remain enrolled in the program for a minimum period of two consecutive plan years following the election to participate in the program.  Any employer other than the State that elects not to participate in the State health Benefits Program shall be prohibited from enrolling in the program for a minimum of two consecutive plan years. 7.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to the State Health Benefits Program (SHBP). State Health Benefits Commission The bill revises the structure of the State Health Benefits Commission (SHBC) to include 11 members as follows: (1) the State Treasurer; the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance; the Chairperson of the Civil Service Commission, or their designees, who will serve ex officio; (2) two members appointed by the Governor; (3) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (4) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the second largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (5) a member appointed by the Public Employee Committee of the New Jersey AFL-CIO who is a member of the public employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO with the public employee organization with the third largest number of employees participating in the State Health Benefits Program; (6) a member appointed by the public employee organization that is not affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO, that represents the largest number of employees in the State Health Benefits Program who are not represented by an employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO; (7) a member appointed by the public employee organization that is not affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO, that represents the second largest number of employees in the State Health Benefits Program who are not represented by an employee organization affiliated with the New Jersey AFL-CIO; and (8) a member, who will serve as chairperson, appointed by the Governor from among three persons nominated jointly by at least eight of the members appointed. The bill specifies that the SHBC will establish the health benefits program and, with respect to plan design, the SHBC will have responsibility for, and authority over, the various health care benefits plans and components of those plans, including medical benefits, prescription drug benefits, dental, vision, and any other health benefits, offered and administered by the SHBP and will have the authority to create, modify, or terminate any plan or component of any health care benefits plan, at its sole discretion.  The bill empowers the SHBC to obtain certain information necessary to make informed decisions and to enter into contracts with third-party administrators and consultants. The SHBC will also be required to follow the advice and guidance of the program actuary when developing plan designs for the health plans provided by the program.  Whenever the program actuary advises that the anticipated costs of one or more of the plans under the program is likely to exceed the rate of medical or prescription drug inflation for a given plan year, as determined by the program actuary based upon relevant indices and information, the commission will be required to take such actions as may be necessary to appropriately mange such costs and ensure the continued viability of the program, subject to established processes including, but not limited to, collective negotiations agreements. Actuarial Report Additionally, the bill requires that within 30 calendar days after the end of the first full plan year next following the enactment and implementation of the bill, the States actuary for the SHBP will issue an actuarial report concerning the SHBP health plans.  The report must include the State and public entities other than the State that participate and do not participate in the State Health Benefits Program, inclusive of retirees who are not Medicare-eligible paid for by the State.  The report must make recommendations addressing the cost of higher priced medications, including, but not limited to, glucagon-like peptide-1 drugs utilized for diabetes, weight loss, and cardiovascular disease. The bill requires the commission to review and consider any prescription medications that have been newly approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration on a quarterly basis and must review such information when considering updates to the prescription drug formularies for each of the plans in the SHBP and those described in the bill. Plan Design Committee and Arbitration Process This bill eliminates the SHBP Plan Design Committee and transfers the powers and functions of the Plan Design Committee to the newly organized SHBC.  With the elimination of the SHBP Plan Design Committee, the bill ends the use of a super conciliator by the SHBP to resolve deadlocked matters before the SHBP Plan Design Committee.  Instead, the bill requires all decisions before the commission to be resolved within 30 days from the date such decisions are placed before the commission.  After the 30 day period, if a decision on a matter before the commission is not reached, or if the commission remains at an impasse, the commission will select a neutral third-party arbitrator with subject matter expertise who will attempt to assist the commission in reaching a voluntary resolution on the matter. The bill requires the arbitrator to promptly schedule investigatory proceedings to investigate and acquire all relevant information regarding the committees failure to render a decision; discuss with the members of the committee their differences, and utilize means and mechanisms, including but not limited to requiring 24-hour per day negotiations, until a voluntary settlement is reached, and provide recommendations to resolve the members differences; and institute any other non-binding procedures deemed appropriate by the arbitrator.  If the actions taken by the arbitrator fail to resolve the dispute after 30 days, the arbitrator will issue a final binding decision, which will be provided to the commission promptly and made available to the public within 10 days thereafter. Medical Claims Review This bill also requires SHBC to require that the third-party medical claims reviewer will annually review at least 33 percent of in-network claims and 33 percent of out-of-network claims to ensure that the SHBP is being properly charged for in-network and out-of-network provider services.  The claims review program will annually review at least 33 percent of claims reimbursed to providers located in New York and Pennsylvania, with a focus on claims resulting from higher cost services, including, but not limited to, services provided by specialty physicians.  The State Treasurer is required to adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section.  The regulations must specify any additional quantitative and qualitative criteria that will apply to the claims review requirements established by this section. SHBP-Local Plans The bill requires that the SHBP offer five plans that provide medical and prescription drug benefits for local government employees of employers other than the State that participate in the SHBP and retirees who are not Medicare-eligible, and their dependents, if any.  However, these provisions will not increase the contribution rates of employees who have 20 or more years of creditable service in one or more State or locally-administered retirement systems on the effective date of the bill, or retirees who retired on or before that effective date. The five plans will be: (1) the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission effective July 1, 2019, except that the commission and employers other than the State will require employee contribution rates as set forth in the bill, which will be the default plan for employees and retirees who fail to affirmatively select a plan during the open enrollment period; (2) the SHBP Tiered Network plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date of this bill, except that the commission and employers other than the State will require employee contribution rates to equate to 75 percent of the rates paid by employees of employers other than the State enrolled in the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan pursuant to the bill; (3) the SHBP PPO 2030 plan as offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date of this bill; (4) the SHBP PPO 2035 plan offered by the State Health Benefits Commission as of the effective date this bill; and (5) the NJ Gold plan. The NJ Gold plan will be developed by the SHBC in a manner which does not require employee contributions in the form of withholding from the employees base salary, or the retirement allowance of retirees.  The NJ Gold plan will provide benefits that are actuarially equivalent to 80 percent of the full actuarial value of the benefits provided under the plan. The bill provides for the escalation or de-escalation of employee contribution rates depending on the anticipated increase or decrease in premium costs, as applicable. The bill directs he State Health Benefits Commission to annually track and calculate the actual premium costs of each plan offered, inclusive of medical and prescription drug costs, following each plans initial offering after the effective date of the bill, and to compare such costs to trends of health care costs at the national, regional, and State levels.  After the commissions review of any mid-year report the commission will meet annually between March 1 and April 15 to discuss actual and projected utilization and costs for plans in which active and retiree members are enrolled.  Such meeting may also include representatives from the New Jersey Division of Pensions and Benefits.  Any cost sharing of any increases or decreases in the premium costs of the health plans offered in each plan year will be subject to adjustment, pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions provided in the bill. Under the bill, every year prior to the renewal of each plan, the commission will determine whether the blended premium, defined in the bill as the premiums for medical and prescription drug rates for all levels of coverage, of a plan in a plan year exceeds the baseline premium, defined in the bill as the blended premium for the current plan year plus one percent. If so, the commission will determine how to manage the plan to lower the premium, reduce the rate of premium increases, or both.  If the commission cannot agree upon plan design changes or other cost saving measures that would reduce the actuarys recommendations for premiums for the upcoming plan year to the preliminary baseline premium by the September 1 preceding the start of the next plan year, then an escalator will be applied to employee contribution rates. If the renewal premium is six percent or more above the preliminary baseline premium, the escalator to be applied to employee contribution rates will be equal to the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index.  Any increase in employee contributions shall be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. If the renewal premium is six percent or more below the preliminary baseline premium, the commission will determine how to manage the plan to share the savings in reduced costs or to improve the quality of the plan through design changes or other measures.  If the commission cannot agree to either reduce costs or improve the quality of the plan, or agree upon a reduction in the employee contribution rates by September 1 preceding the start of the plan year, then contribution rates will be reduced by the application of a de-escalator.  The de-escalator will be the amount of the decrease in the renewal premium. Any decrease in employee contributions will be effective the first pay period of the new plan year. The commissions actions undertaken pursuant to the escalator and de-escalator provisions will not be subject to the commissions dispute resolution procedures. Non-SHBP-Local Employers The bill also requires that within 180 days following the enactment this bill, when a public employer other than the State does not participate in the SHBP and its employees are enrolled in medical and prescription drug plans with higher annual premiums than the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan or higher employee contribution rates than for the SHBP Unity 2019 PPO plan as set forth in the bill, upon request of the collective negotiations representative who represents those employees, the public employer other than the State and the collective negotiations representative will negotiate over offering employees a health care plan substantially similar in design to the 2019 Unity PPO at substantially similar contribution rates, offering employees incentives to select plans with lower costs, or, in the alternative, enrolling in the SHBP.  Modifications to the health benefit provisions of collective negotiations agreements or to health benefit plans, including prescription drug plans, offered to employees, will only be by mutual agreement between the collective negotiations representative and the local employer.  Upon request of the parties, the Public Employment Relations Commission will assign a mediator to assist in the resolution of a dispute. If mediation is unsuccessful and the parties are unable to reach a mutual agreement, there will be no changes to health benefits provided pursuant to a collective negotiations agreement, practice, or policy. The bill clarifies that local government entities that do not participate in the SHBP will be permitted to utilize health reimbursement arrangements pursuant to collective negotiations agreements to offset IRS eligible employee out-of-pocket costs related to eligible medical and prescription drug services.  The bill also specifies that its provisions will not be construed to interfere with or require changes to the health plans offered by a public employer other than the State that does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program. Local Participation in SHBP The bill also requires that, within one year from the effective date of this bill, any employer other than the State will be required to make a determination as to whether or not to participate in the SHBP.  Any employer other than the State which elects to participate in the SHBP will be required to remain enrolled in the program for a minimum period of two consecutive plan years following the election to participate in the program.  Any employer other than the State that elects not to participate in the SHBP will be prohibited from enrolling in the program for a minimum of two consecutive plan years.
