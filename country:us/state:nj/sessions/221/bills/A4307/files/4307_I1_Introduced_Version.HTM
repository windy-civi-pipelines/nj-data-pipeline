extent consistent with law, any interstate agency to which New Jersey is a

residence in this State and shall execute such office, employment, or position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This residency requirement
shall not apply to any person: (a) who is employed on a temporary or
per-semester basis as a visiting professor, teacher, lecturer, or researcher by
any State college, university, or other higher educational institution, or
county or community college, or in a full or part-time position as a member of
the faculty, the research staff, or the administrative staff by any State
college, university, or other higher educational institution, or county or
community college, that the college, university, or institution has included in
the report required to be filed pursuant to this subsection; (b) who is
employed full-time by the State who serves in an office, employment, or
position that requires the person to spend the majority of the person's working
hours in a location outside of this State; or (c) an officer of the waterfront
commission of New York harbor, employed by the commission on the effective date
of P.L.2017, c.324 (C.32:23-229 et al.), who seeks to be transferred to the
Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.2017, c.324 (C.53:2-9).</p>

subsection, a person may have at most one principal residence, and the state of
a person's principal residence means the state (1) where the person spends the
majority of the person's nonworking time, and (2) which is most clearly the
center of the person's domestic life, and (3) which is designated as the
person's legal address and legal residence for voting.  The fact that a person
is domiciled in this State shall not by itself satisfy the requirement of
principal residency hereunder.</p>

office, employment, or position, who holds an office, employment, or position
in this State on the effective date of P.L.2011, c.70 but does not have
principal residence in this State on that effective date shall not be subject
to the residency requirement of this subsection while the person continues to
hold office, employment, or position without a break in public service of
greater than seven days.</p>

exemption from the provisions of this subsection on the basis of critical need
or hardship <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>from
a<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>. 
A school district may request an exemption from the provisions of this
subsection on the basis of an inability to hire an appropriately certified teacher

school district requesting an exemption shall certify that the vacant teaching
position has been advertised for at least six months; demonstrate the
districts good faith efforts to fill the position with a teacher who maintains
a principal residence in this State; and submit documentation that the person
the district seeks to hire is appropriately certified as a teacher in this
State.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>A</u> five-member committee
<u>is</u> hereby established to consider applications for exemptions.  The
committee shall be composed of three persons appointed by the Governor, a
person appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, and a person appointed
by the President of the Senate, each of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the
person making the appointment and shall have a term not to exceed five years. 
A vacancy on the committee shall be filled in the same manner as the original
appointment was made.  The Governor shall make provision to provide such
clerical, secretarial, and administrative support to the committee as may be
necessary for it to conduct its responsibilities pursuant to this subsection.<u>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The decision on whether to
approve an application from any person <u>or school district</u> shall be made
by a majority vote of the members of the committee, and those voting in the

act on an application within 30 days after the receipt thereof, no exemption
shall be granted and the residency requirement of this subsection shall be
operative.  </p>

a report of those full or part-time positions as a member of the faculty, the
research staff, or the administrative staff requiring special expertise or
extraordinary qualifications in an academic, scientific, technical,

universities, or institutions in other states.  The report shall be compiled
annually and shall also contain the reasons why the positions were selected for
inclusion in the report.  The report shall be compiled and filed within 60 days

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes an
exemption to the State residency requirement for certain public school
teachers.  An appropriately certified teacher hired through the exemption has
two years to establish New Jersey residency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The State residency
requirement was expanded in 2011 to apply to, with limited exceptions, all
public officers and employees in the State, including employees of a school
district, or an authority, board, body, agency, commission, or instrumentality
of the district.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a school
district may request an exemption on the basis of an inability to hire an
appropriately certified teacher for a vacant teaching position who complies
with the State residency requirement.  A school district requesting an
exemption is required to: certify that the vacant teaching position has been
advertised for at least six months; demonstrate the districts good faith
efforts to fill the position with a teacher who maintains a principal residence
in this State; and submit documentation that the person the district seeks to
hire is appropriately certified as a teacher in the State.  If a school
district is granted an exemption, the district is then permitted to hire the
appropriately certified teacher.  The bill provides that the person hired is
not required to request the exemption.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
stipulates that any person hired through this exemption is required to establish
New Jersey residency within two years of the date of the persons initial
employment.  If the person fails to establish New Jersey residency, the school
district is required to terminate the persons employment, advertise the vacant
teaching position, and seek to hire an appropriately certified teacher who
maintains a principal residence in this State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires the
Department of Education, in collaboration with the Department of Community
Affairs, to develop and implement a program to assist teachers hired through
this exemption to establish State residency within two years of the date of the
persons initial employment.</p>
