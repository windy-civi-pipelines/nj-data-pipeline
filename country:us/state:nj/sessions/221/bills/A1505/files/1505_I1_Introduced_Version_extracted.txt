A violation of any subsection of this section is a crime of the first degree if the offense results in: (1)   a substantial interruption or impairment of public communication, transportation, supply of water, gas or power, or other public service. The term "substantial interruption or impairment" shall mean such interruption or impairment that: (a)   affects 10 or more structures or habitations; (b)   lasts for two or more hours; or (c)   creates a risk of death or significant bodily injury to any person; (2)   damages or loss in excess of $250,000; or (3)   significant bodily injury to any person. Every sentence of imprisonment for a crime of the first degree committed in violation of this section shall include a minimum term of one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, during which term the defendant shall not be eligible for parole. h.    Every sentence imposed upon a conviction pursuant to this section shall, if the victim is a government agency, include a period of imprisonment. The period of imprisonment shall include a minimum term of one-third to one-half of the sentence imposed, during which term the defendant shall not be eligible for parole.  The victim shall be deemed to be a government agency if a computer, computer network, computer storage medium, computer system, computer equipment, computer program, computer software, computer data or data base that is a subject of the crime is owned, operated or maintained by or on behalf of a governmental agency or unit of State or local government or a public authority.  The defendant shall be strictly liable under this subsection and it shall not be a defense that the defendant did not know or intend that the victim was a government agency, or that the defendant intended that there be other victims of the crime. A violation of any subsection of this section shall be a distinct offense from a violation of any other subsection of this section, and a conviction for a violation of any subsection of this section shall not merge with a conviction for a violation of any other subsection of this section or section 10 of P.L.1984, c.184 (C.2C:20-31), or for conspiring or attempting to violate any subsection of this section or section 10 of P.L.1984, c.184 (C.2C:20-31), and a separate sentence shall be imposed for each such conviction. When a violation of any subsection of this section involves an offense committed against a person under 18 years of age, the violation shall constitute an aggravating circumstance to be considered by the court when determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. (cf: P.L.2003, c.39, s.3) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend the current law concerning computer theft to specifically address the bombing of online video conferences or teleconferences. Under current law, a person is guilty of computer criminal activity if, among other provisions, the person purposely or knowingly and without authorization, or in excess of authorization, accesses and recklessly alters, damages or destroys any data, data base, computer, computer storage medium, computer program, computer software, computer equipment, computer system or computer network.  This bill amends the statute to include unauthorized access to, and disruption of, an online video conference or teleconference. Currently, it is a crime of the fourth degree to violate this provision of law, except that it is a crime of the third degree if the value of the damage exceeds $5,000.  Under the bill, it would also be a crime of the third degree if the violation consists of accessing an online video conference or teleconference without authorization and posting or displaying obscene material in violation of N.J.S.2C:34-3 that is viewed by a minor under the age of 18. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months or a fine up to $10,000, or both; a crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of three to five years or a fine up to $15,000, or both.
