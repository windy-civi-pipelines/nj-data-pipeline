For the purpose of conducting any program pursuant to this paragraph, the department, in consultation with the authority and the board, shall determine:  (a) the appropriate level of grants or other forms of financial assistance to be awarded to local governments; (b) the evaluation criteria for selecting projects to be awarded grants or other forms of financial assistance; (c) the process by which grants or other forms of financial assistance can be applied for and awarded; and (d) a mechanism by which to quantify benefits; and (4)   Ten percent shall be allocated to the department to support programs that enhance the stewardship and restoration of the State's forests and tidal marshes that provide important opportunities to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases. c.  (1)  The department may use up to four percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the department in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases including any obligations that may arise under subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-55). (2)   The board may use up to two percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the board in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases including any obligations that may arise under subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-55). (3)   The New Jersey Economic Development Authority may use up to two percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the authority in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. d.   The State Comptroller shall conduct or supervise independent audit and fiscal oversight functions of the fund and its uses. (cf: P.L.2019, c.362, s.12) 6.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT State law at P.L.2019, c.362 (C.48:25-1 et seq.) currently authorizes the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to offer financial incentives to consumers in the State to encourage their purchase or lease of light duty plug-in electric vehicles.  This bill would expand this existing incentive program in order to additionally authorize the BPU to make financial incentives available to consumers to encourage their purchase or lease of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  The bill defines hydrogen fuel cell vehicle as a zero emission vehicle, as defined in section 11 of P.L.2003, c. 266 (C.54:32B-8.55), that is fueled primarily by hydrogen, but that may also have off-vehicle charge capability.  The term would include any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. Under the bills provisions, incentives offered for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are to be limited to a maximum amount of $5,000 per eligible vehicle and are to be calculated in a manner deemed appropriate by the board.  Like the light duty plug-in electric vehicle incentives currently offered under the States vehicle incentive program, the new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle incentives are to be made available under the program until June 30 of the tenth year following the original date of the programs establishment under P.L.2019, c.362. In addition to the new incentives established in the bill, receipts from the sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also exempt under existing law, from the State Sales and Use Tax, pursuant to the current exemption for zero emission vehicles established by section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55).

For the purpose of conducting any program pursuant to this paragraph, the department, in consultation with the authority and the board, shall determine:  (a) the appropriate level of grants or other forms of financial assistance to be awarded to local governments; (b) the evaluation criteria for selecting projects to be awarded grants or other forms of financial assistance; (c) the process by which grants or other forms of financial assistance can be applied for and awarded; and (d) a mechanism by which to quantify benefits; and (4)   Ten percent shall be allocated to the department to support programs that enhance the stewardship and restoration of the State's forests and tidal marshes that provide important opportunities to sequester or reduce greenhouse gases. c.  (1)  The department may use up to four percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the department in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases including any obligations that may arise under subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-55). (2)   The board may use up to two percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the board in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases including any obligations that may arise under subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-55). (3)   The New Jersey Economic Development Authority may use up to two percent of the total amount in the fund each year to pay for administrative costs justifiable and approved in the annual budget process, incurred by the authority in administering the provisions of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-45 et al.) and in administering programs to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. d.   The State Comptroller shall conduct or supervise independent audit and fiscal oversight functions of the fund and its uses. (cf: P.L.2019, c.362, s.12) 6.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT State law at P.L.2019, c.362 (C.48:25-1 et seq.) currently authorizes the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to offer financial incentives to consumers in the State to encourage their purchase or lease of light duty plug-in electric vehicles.  This bill would expand this existing incentive program in order to additionally authorize the BPU to make financial incentives available to consumers to encourage their purchase or lease of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  The bill defines hydrogen fuel cell vehicle as a zero emission vehicle, as defined in section 11 of P.L.2003, c. 266 (C.54:32B-8.55), that is fueled primarily by hydrogen, but that may also have off-vehicle charge capability.  The term would include any passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled by power derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel. Under the bills provisions, incentives offered for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are to be limited to a maximum amount of $5,000 per eligible vehicle and are to be calculated in a manner deemed appropriate by the board.  Like the light duty plug-in electric vehicle incentives currently offered under the States vehicle incentive program, the new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle incentives are to be made available under the program until June 30 of the tenth year following the original date of the programs establishment under P.L.2019, c.362. In addition to the new incentives established in the bill, receipts from the sale of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are also exempt under existing law, from the State Sales and Use Tax, pursuant to the current exemption for zero emission vehicles established by section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55).
