<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>       State law at P.L.2019, c.362
(C.48:25-1 et seq.) currently authorizes the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) to
offer financial incentives to consumers in the State to encourage their
purchase or lease of light duty plug-in electric vehicles.  This bill would
expand this existing incentive program in order to additionally authorize the
BPU to make financial incentives available to consumers to encourage their
purchase or lease of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>The bill defines hydrogen fuel cell vehicle</span> as <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>a zero emission vehicle, as defined in section 11 of
P.L.2003, c. 266 (C.54:32B-8.55), that is fueled primarily by hydrogen, but that
may also have off-vehicle charge capability.  The term would include any
passenger car, station wagon, or other motor vehicle that is propelled by power
derived from one or more cells that convert chemical energy directly into
electricity by combining oxygen with hydrogen fuel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions,
incentives offered for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are to be limited to a
maximum amount of $5,000 per eligible vehicle and are to be calculated in a
manner deemed appropriate by the board.  Like the light duty plug-in electric
vehicle incentives currently offered under the States vehicle incentive
program, the new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle incentives are to be made available
under the program until June 30 of the tenth year following the original date
of the programs establishment under P.L.2019, c.362.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to the new
incentives established in the bill, receipts from the sale of hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles are also exempt under existing law, from the State Sales and Use
Tax, pursuant to the current exemption for zero emission vehicles established
by section 11 of P.L.2003, c.266 (C.54:32B-8.55). </p>
