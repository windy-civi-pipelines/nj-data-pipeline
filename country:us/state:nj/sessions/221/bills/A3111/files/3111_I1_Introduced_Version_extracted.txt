(cf:  P.L.1982, c.113, s.17) 6.  (New section)  a.  For the purpose of selecting a redeveloper or a person to perform the construction of any public redevelopment project under P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.), the municipality or redevelopment entity shall use either a design-bid-build or a design-build delivery system.  If the municipality or redevelopment entity selects a design-bid-build delivery system, the municipality or redevelopment entity unit shall solicit proposals and award design-bid-build contracts in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), and the municipality or redevelopment entity shall act as a contracting unit under that law.  If the municipality or redevelopment entity selects a design-build delivery system, the municipality or redevelopment entity shall solicit proposals and award design-build contract in accordance with the requirements of P.L.2021, c.71 (C.52:35B-1 et seq.), and the municipality or redevelopment entity shall act as a contracting unit under that law. b.  As used in this section: Construct and construction shall mean and include acts of clearance, demolition, construction, development or redevelopment, reconstruction, replacement, extension, improvement, and betterment. Delivery system means the procedure used to develop and construct a public redevelopment project. Design-bid-build means the delivery system used in a public redevelopment project in which a licensed and prequalified design professional develops the project design in its entirety; and the municipality or redevelopment entity then solicits bids and awards the contract to the lowest responsible bidder that demonstrates the ability to complete the project specified in the design. Design-build means the delivery system in which a design-builder provides labor, materials, and other construction services for a public redevelopment project under a contract with a municipality or redevelopment entity. Design-builder means the entity, whether natural person, partnership, joint stock company, corporation, trust, professional corporation, business association, or other legal business entity or successor, that proposes to design and construct any public redevelopment project who is registered pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.), and classified by the New Jersey Division of Property Management and Construction or the New Jersey Department of Transportation, where applicable, to perform work on a design-build project. Design professional means the entity, whether natural person, partnership, joint stock company, corporation, trust, professional corporation, business association, or other legal business entity or successor that provides licensed and prequalified architectural, engineering, or surveying services in accordance with R.S.45:3-1 et seq., and P.L.1938, c.342 (C.45:8-27 et seq.), and that shall be responsible for planning, designing, and observing the construction of the public redevelopment project. Public redevelopment project means a redevelopment project where the construction is done under contract with a public body and is:  (1) paid for in whole or in part out of the funds of a public body, or (2) done on a property or premises owned, leased, or to be subsequently leased by a public body.   Public redevelopment project shall not be construed to include construction on property which is privately owned and entirely financed by a private developer. 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require the use of either a design-bid-build or design-build delivery system for construction projects undertaken by a county improvement authority pursuant to the county improvement authorities law, P.L.1960, c.183 (C.40:37A-44 et seq.) and for public redevelopment projects undertaken by a municipality or redevelopment entity pursuant to the Local Redevelopment and Housing Law, P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et seq.).  If a design-bid-build delivery system is selected, then the provisions of the "Local Public Contracts Law," P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), would apply.  If a design-build delivery system is selected, then the provisions of the Design Build Construction Services Procurement Act, P.L.2021, c.71 (C.52:35B-1 et seq.) would apply.
