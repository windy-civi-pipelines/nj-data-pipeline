<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 12 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-54) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12. a. District factor group A
and B school districts, and district factor group CD school districts with a
concentration of at-risk pupils equal to or greater than 40%, shall provide
free access to full-day preschool for all three- and four-year old pupils.  All
other school districts shall provide free access to full-day preschool for
at-risk pupils.  Preschool education aid shall reflect the cost of the pupil's
placement in either a district program, a licensed child care provider program,
or a Head Start Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Preschool education aid
shall be calculated for district factor group A and B school districts, and for
district factor group CD school districts with a concentration of at-risk
pupils equal to or greater than 40%, as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Aid = (IDE x IDA) + (PRE x
PRA) + (HSE x HSA)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     where </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     IDE is the number of district
pupils, other than preschool disabled pupils, in an in-district preschool
program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     IDA is the per pupil aid
amount for an in-district preschool program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     PRE is the number of district
pupils, other than preschool disabled pupils, in a preschool program operated
by a licensed child care provider;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     PRA is the per pupil aid
amount for a preschool program operated by a licensed child care provider;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     HSE is the number of district

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     HSA is the per pupil aid
amount for a Head Start Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>A CD school district with a
concentration of at-risk pupils equal to or greater than 40% shall be eligible
to receive preschool education aid pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph
for a minimum of three school years from the time of initial determination of
eligibility even if the district's concentration of at-risk pupils falls below
a 40% concentration of at-risk pupils.  In the event that the district falls
below a 40% concentration of at-risk pupils for two consecutive school years,
in the third school year the district shall receive preschool education aid for
each at-risk pupil and for any four-year old pupil for whom the district
received preschool education aid in the prior school year, and that pupil shall
receive free preschool education.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Preschool education aid
shall be calculated for all other districts as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Aid = (ARID x IDA) + (ARP x

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In accordance with
regulations adopted by the commissioner, all districts shall submit a five-year
plan that provides for the full implementation of full-day preschool for all
eligible three- and four-year olds by the 2013-2014 school year. For the
purposes of this section, &quot;full implementation&quot; means serving 90% of
eligible pupils in accordance with the preschool quality standards adopted by
the commissioner or such greater percentage as determined by the commissioner. 
A school district shall annually update the five-year plan based on actual
implementation experience and shall revise its pupil projections in accordance
with that experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. (1) In the case of a school
district that did not receive any form of preschool aid in the 2007-2008 school
year, the 2008-2009 school year shall be a preschool planning year. Beginning
in the 2009-2010 school year, the school district shall receive preschool
education aid calculated in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of
