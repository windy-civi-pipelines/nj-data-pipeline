The division shall be the States grant manager for federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds, and is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable federal rules and regulations for this act, including, but not limited to, submitting all required reporting and documentation to the United States Department of the Treasury in accordance with federal rules, including with respect to the American Rescue Plan Act, Pub.L.117-2.  As the States grant manager for federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Funds, the division shall require funds for organizational, administrative, and other work and services, including salaries, services, equipment, and materials necessary to administer the applicable provisions of this act. c. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary, the division may transfer the uncommitted balance of any funds made available pursuant to this section for any use authorized under this act.  The division shall submit notice to the Joint Budget Oversight Committee no less than five calendar days before the date of the transfer.  The notice shall indicate the amount of the transferred funds and the purpose for which the funds are transferred.

The Child Care Revitalization Act appropriates federal funds, allocated to the State from the federal Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund established pursuant to the federal American Rescue Plan Act, Pub.L.117-2, as the funding stream for the child care facilities improvement grants. The Economic Development Authority is currently developing a facilities improvement grant program, to be funded with State resources that have already been appropriated to the authority, for family child care providers.  Both the sponsor and the authority believe that a State-funded program will provide a less burdensome application, implementation, and compliance experience for family child care providers. The initial phase of the Child Care Facilities Improvement Act provides grants, in an amount ranging from $50,000 to $200,000, for qualifying facilities improvement projects undertaken by child care centers licensed by the Department of Children and Families prior to June 4, 2021.  Family Child Care providers are not eligible for the first phase of the grant program.
