students living in low-income families that are federally eligible for free or
reduced price school meals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares that New Jersey schools have made great strides in serving
breakfast to more students at the start of the school day, achieving a 73 percent
increase since 2010; and that, despite this progress, only 44 percent of
low-income students in New Jersey received breakfast through the federal School
Breakfast Program, according to the most recent data published by Advocates for
Children of New Jersey, meaning that approximately 304,000 low-income students

law <u>generally</u> does not specify how <u>school</u> breakfast is to be
served to students; and that <u>it is, therefore, reasonable and necessary, and
consistent with the ongoing expansion of New Jerseys breakfast program laws, for
the State to further supplement its laws, in this regard</u>, by requiring
high-poverty schools to serve breakfast to students through a breakfast after

served, and that this expansion can, therefore, be easily accomplished; that,
since 2010, the amount of federal school breakfast reimbursements has more than
doubled from about $45 million to an anticipated $105 million in fiscal year
2018; and that Advocates for Children of New Jersey estimates that school
districts could collect an additional $89 million in federal funds for school breakfast
each year if breakfast is served during the first few minutes of the school
day.</p>

determines that:  it shall be the public policy of the State to help remove a
major barrier to learning by providing children the nutrition they need to
succeed in school; it is the understanding and the intention of the Legislature
to make breakfast an integral part of the school day; and the implementation of
breakfast after the bell programs is the most effective way to ensure that all
students have the morning nutrition they need to concentrate, learn, and
succeed in school.</p>

Program, and public and nonpublic schools offering school breakfasts under the
federal School Breakfast Program, to respectively provide school lunches or school
breakfasts, or both, to all enrolled students, free of charge, regardless of
whether each such student is determined to be federally eligible for free or
reduced price school meals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under existing federal law, a
student is federally eligible to receive free or reduced price school lunch
under the National School Lunch Program, or free or reduced price school
breakfast under the federal School Breakfast Program, only if the student is
determined to be categorically eligible for such benefits (i.e., is determined
to be a homeless child, a migrant child, a runaway child, a foster child, or a
Head Start Child, or is a participant in certain public benefits programs) or
can demonstrate either that the student lives in a low-income household  i.e.,
a household having an annual income of not more than 185 percent of the federal
poverty level (FPL).  Pursuant to the recently enacted Working Class Families
Anti-Hunger Act, P.L.2022, c.104 (C.18A:33-3.2 et al.), as amended by
P.L.2023, c.336 (C.18A:33-14.2 et al.), New Jersey has additionally provided
for free school meals, subsidized by the State, to be provided to public school
and non-public school students from middle-income families  i.e., families
having an income of up to 224 percent of the FPL).  This bill would provide for
the further expansion of the existing State law, in this area, in order to
expressly require all school districts and public or nonpublic schools
participating in the National School Lunch Program or the federal School
Breakfast Program to provide school lunch or breakfast, or both, as appropriate,
to all enrolled students, free of charge, regardless of each such students
categorical eligibility or income-eligibility for federally subsidized school
meals.  Any student who is neither categorically nor income-eligible to receive
free school meals subsidized by the federal government would, under the bills
provisions, still be deemed to be statutorily eligible for free school meals
fully subsidized by the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All students who are deemed to
be categorically eligible, income-eligible, or statutorily eligible for subsidized
school meals, under the bills expanded eligibility provisions, would be
eligible to continue receiving such school meals, free of charge, through a
summer meals program, and, if enrolled at a public school, through an emergency
meals distribution program that is activated during a period of public school
closure resulting from COVID-19.  The bill would revise the existing law to
require schools to request that a students parent or guardian complete a
household income data collection form for the limited purposes specified in the
bill.  This data collection form would serve the same purposes as the current
subsidized school meals application that is used to certify students as
eligible for free or reduced price school meals; however, parents and guardians
would be encouraged, and no longer required, to submit such forms in order for
the student to receive free school meals, as provided by the bill.  Any parent
or guardian declining to provide such income-related data would be required to
submit a signed acknowledgement card confirming that declination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consistent with State-level
reimbursement requirements previously established, pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.2019, c.445 (C.18A:33-21.1) and the Working Class Families Anti-Hunger Act,
this bill would require the State to provide funding, to each school or school
district participating in the National School Lunch Program or federal School
Breakfast Program, as may be necessary to reimburse the costs associated with
the provision, by such school or district, of subsidized school meals to
students who are federally ineligible for free or reduced price school meals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would repeal various
sections of existing law, pertaining to school lunch programs, school breakfast
programs, and summer meals programs, which are contrary to the bills universal
free meal provisions.  Some of the sections being repealed would be replaced by
new sections of the bill.  The sections being repealed, and the provisions
replacing those repealed sections, are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  Section 1 of P.L.2006,
c.14 (C.18A:33-3.1).  This section pertains to prepayment for school lunches. 
Because students will no longer be required to pay for school lunches under the
bill, this section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.53 (C.18A:33-5).  This section exempts, from school lunch requirements, any
school in which less than five percent of enrolled students meet federal
eligibility requirements for receipt of free meals.  Because the bill requires
all schools to provide free school lunches, this section is being repealed;
however, the exemption previously provided thereby is being restated in section
1 of P.L.1974, c.53 (C.18A:33-4), as amended by section 2 of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Section 3 of P.L.2003,
c.4 (C.18A:33-11).  This section requires a school district to publicize the
availability of the federal School Breakfast Program, to ensure that students
eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts are not treated differently than
other students, and to encourage students who are not eligible for free or
reduced price breakfasts to, nonetheless, participate in the federal School
Breakfast Program.  Because the bill provides that income-eligibility may not
be considered when providing free meals to students, this section is being
repealed, and its publicity provisions are being moved to, and restated in,
other provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  Section 1 of P.L.2015,
c.15 (C.18A:33-21).  This section provides procedures to be implemented by a
school district, and establishes certain prohibitions on discriminatory
treatment, when a students school breakfast or school lunch bill is in
arrears.  Because students will not be required to pay for school lunch or
breakfast under the bills provisions and the determination of school meal
arrearages will, therefore, not be relevant to whether a student receives
school meals under the bill, this section is being repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)  Section 1 of P.L.2020,
c.29 (C.18A:33-21a).  This section established a short title (the Hunger-Free
Students Bill of Rights Act), which was to be used in citing to section 1 of
P.L.2015, c.15 (C.18A:33-21) and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2020, c.29 (C.18A:33-21b
and C.18A:33-21c).  However, section 3 of P.L.2020, c.29 (C.18A:33-21b) was
previously repealed by P.L.2023, c.336 (C.18A:33-14.2 et al.), and section 1 of
P.L.2015, c.15 (C.18A:33-21) is being repealed by this bill.  In addition,
because the only remaining provision of law cited in this section  i.e., section
4 of P.L.2020, c.29 (C.18A:33-21c)  contains only a single sentence related to
the receipt of school meals by homeless students (and does not a more detailed
provision establishing a bill of rights for all students), it no longer seems
necessary or appropriate to attach a short title to this sole remaining
provision of law, particularly when the existing short title does not reflect
the purpose of that remaining provision.  As a result, this short title section
is being repealed.</p>
