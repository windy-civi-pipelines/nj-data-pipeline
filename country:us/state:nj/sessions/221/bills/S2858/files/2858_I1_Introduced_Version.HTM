Section 1:
S2858 SENATE, No. 2858 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 4, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Requires BPU to adopt regulations allowing wastewater utilities to impose wastewater system improvement charge. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning wastewater infrastructure, and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Board of Public Utilities shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations that authorize a rate recovery mechanism to allow a wastewater utility to impose a wastewater system improvement charge for the costs of rehabilitating, improving, or replacing wastewater infrastructure. As used in this section, "wastewater utility" means an entity that provides wastewater treatment services whose rates are subject to the regulation and control of the Board of Public Utilities. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize the Board of Public Utilities (board) to adopt rules and regulations that authorize a rate recovery mechanism to allow a wastewater utility to impose a wastewater system improvement charge for the costs of rehabilitating, improving, or replacing wastewater infrastructure.  The board has already adopted regulations that allow water supply utilities to impose a distribution system improvement charge at N.J.A.C.14:9-10.1 et seq.  This bill would require the adoption of similar regulations applicable to wastewater utilities.  The adoption of regulations applicable to wastewater utilities would accelerate the rehabilitation, improvement, or replacement of deteriorating or failing wastewater infrastructure.
