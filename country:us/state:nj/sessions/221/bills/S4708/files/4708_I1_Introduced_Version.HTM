<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would create greater
flexibility in the municipal consolidation process, set forth in sections 25
through 28 of P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-25 through C.40A:65-28), in the following
ways:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>        non-contiguous
municipalities would be permitted to consolidate if located within a reasonable
distance of one another; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         applicants for
consolidation would be allowed to develop their own process for the
equalization of property assessments in the new municipality, subject to the
approval of the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         districts based on old or
newly established boundaries with unique planning mechanisms, services, and
ordinances would be permitted in the new municipality; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         existing debt, or debt
newly created by any financial arrangement between any or all of the former
municipalities in furtherance of any aspect of a consolidation plan, may be
apportioned among the taxpayers of the consolidating municipalities as debt
within special taxing districts in any manner that the parties mutually agree upon
in the consolidation plan;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         consolidating
municipalities would be permitted to enter into any financial or other
agreement to adjust benefits between the municipalities, provide
indemnification from legal actions stemming from a consolidation, or provide
incentives or other acts to facilitate municipal consolidation; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         a joint public hearing on
applications for consideration of a consolidation plan or to create a Municipal
Consolidation Study Commission would no longer be required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides greater
clarity with respect to the municipal consolidation process in the following
ways: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         clarification of the
petition process for the creation of a Municipal Consolidation Study
Commission, by providing specifics as to the form of the petition, its filing,
and its verification, consistent with requirements for a petition proposing the
formation of a joint </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>municipal consolidation study
commission under the &quot;Municipal Consolidation Act,&quot; P.L.1977, c.435
(C.40:43-66.35 et al.);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         provision of specific
requirements with regard to the composition, meetings, and responsibilities of
a Municipal Consolidation Study Commission; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         clarification that a
consolidation must be implemented in accordance with the consolidation plan
under the oversight of the Local Finance Board;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         clarification that a
Municipal Consolidation Study Commission report must address the implementation
issues set forth in subsection a. of section 26 of P.L.2007, c. 63
(C.40A:65-26);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         the Director of the
Division of Taxation would be expressly permitted to waive any law, rule, or
regulation concerning the assessment of property that may not have anticipated
a phase-in or consolidation of services if a waiver is found reasonable to
further the process of consolidation, as may already be pursued through a
referral to the agency pursuant to provisions of existing law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         the Local Finance Board
would be expressly permitted to, in making decisions concerning consolidation,
pursue a waiver of a law, rule, or regulation that may not have anticipated a
phase-in or consolidation of services through referral of the matter to the
appropriate agency pursuant to provisions of existing law; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>         the Local Finance Board
would be expressly authorized to make decisions and issue orders regarding
consolidation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits the
designation of an administrative support entity to handle the administrative
affairs of the Municipal Consolidation Study Commission so that the commission
can focus on its work in creating a consolidation plan.  An administrative
support entity would be subject to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1
et seq.), more commonly known as the Open Public Records Act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a referendum
in a new municipality on whether to have a municipal open space tax, and the
amount or rate of such tax, if one or more of the consolidating municipalities
has an annual open space tax levy, even if all the consolidating municipalities
have an open space tax at the same rate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that an
application to create a Municipal Consolidation Study Commission include the
proposed means of funding the study. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that a
consolidation plan and a Municipal Consolidation Study Commission report
address the projected property tax impact resulting from consolidation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides certain
seniority, tenure, pension, and other protections for law enforcement officers
and chiefs of police and for firefighters and fire chiefs in a consolidation,
consistent with the protections for law enforcement officers and police chiefs
current law provides in the case of shared services and joint contracts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that,
whenever one or more of the participating municipalities is subject to Civil
Service, terminal leave payments be made to employees who were terminated for
reasons of economy and efficiency as a result of a consolidation, consistent
with the existing terminal leave requirement for shared services and joint
contracts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the voters
of each participating municipality to approve of a proposed consolidation in
order for it to be implemented, regardless of whether it is proposed by the
governing bodies of the municipalities or a petition-created Municipal
Consolidation Study Commission.  Current law only requires approval of a
consolidation by voter referendum if a consolidation is pursued by a Municipal
Consolidation Study Commission created by applications of the governing bodies
of the municipalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill also revises
the procedures for the consolidation of a sparsely populated municipality
pursuant to P.L.1995, c.376 (C.40:43-66.78 et seq.).  These revisions include changing
the definition of a &quot;sparsely populated municipality&quot; to include a
municipality with a population of less than 1,000.  Current law defines such
municipality as one with a population of less than 500.  The revisions also
include requiring voter approval for a sparsely populated municipality with a
population of less than 100.  Current law allows such municipality to
consolidate by ordinances adopted by the governing bodies of the participating
municipalities.  The revisions also require the formulation of a plan to
consolidate a sparsely populated municipality with an absorbing municipality.</p>
