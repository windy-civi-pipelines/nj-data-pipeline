The policy will include: (1)  a plan for parental participation in schools to improve parent and teacher cooperation in areas such as homework, school attendance, and discipline; (2)  a procedure for the parent to learn about the parents minor childs course of study including the source of any supplemental education materials; (3)  procedures for the parent to object to instructional materials and other materials used in the class, where such objection may be based on beliefs regarding morality, sex, and religion that such materials are harmful; (4)  procedures for the parent to withdraw the parents minor child out of the school districts comprehensive health education that relates to sex education or instruction regarding sexuality, sexual orientation, and sexual transitioning, if the parent provides a written objection to the minor childs participation, and for the parent to be notified in advance of such course content so that the parent may withdraw the parents minor child from those portions of the course; (5)  procedures for the parent to learn about the nature and purpose of clubs and activities offered at the minor childs school, including those that are extracurricular or part of the school curriculum; and (6)  procedures for the parent to learn about the rights of parents including all of the following: (a)    the right to review information concerning school choice options including open enrollment; (b)  the right of the parent to exempt the minor child from immunizations; (c)  the right of the parent to review Statewide, standardized assessment results; (d)  the right of the parent to enroll the child in gifted or special education programs; (e)  the right of the parent to inspect school district instructional materials; (f)  the right of the parent to access information relating to the school districts policies for promotion or retention including high school graduation requirements; (g)  the right of the parent to receive a school report card and be informed of the minor childs attendance requirements; (h)  the right of the parent to access information relating to the State public education system, State standards, report card requirements, attendance requirements, and instruction materials requirements; (i)  the right of the parent to participate in parent-teacher associations and organizations that are sanctioned by a district board of education or the Department of Education; (j)  the right of the parent to enroll the parents minor child in the local school within the childs school district; and (k)  the right of the parent to opt out of any district-level data collection relating to the minor child not required by law. This bill requires each district board of education to provide the information required by the bill electronically or post such information on its Internet website.  The bill provides that the parent of a minor child may request, in writing, from the school superintendent the information required by the bill.  Within 10 days, the school superintendent will provide such information to the parent.  If the school superintendent denies the parents request for information or does not respond to the parents request within 10 days, the parent may appeal the denial to the district board of education.  The district board of education will place the parents appeal on the agenda for its next public meeting, or as soon as practicable, if the agenda can no longer be amended. Except as otherwise provided by law, the bill prohibits a health care provider from providing, soliciting, or arranging to provide health care services or prescribe medicinal drugs to a minor child without first obtaining written parental consent.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the bill prohibits a health care facility from allowing a medical procedure to be performed on a minor child in its facility without first obtaining written parental consent. The provisions of the bill will not apply to the performance of medical or surgical care and procedures by a hospital, or by a physician licensed to practice medicine and surgery, on a married person who is a minor or a pregnant person who is a minor, who has provided consent to the care or procedure pursuant to P.L.1965, c.217 (C.9:17A-1).  The provisions of the bill will also not apply to services provided by a clinical laboratory, unless the services are delivered through a direct encounter with a minor child at the clinical laboratory.  The bill provides that a health care provider or any other person who violates this bill will be subject to disciplinary action and will be guilty of a misdemeanor.
