the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the Parents Bill of Rights.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds and
declares that it is a fundamental right of parents to direct the upbringing,
education, and care of their minor children.  The Legislature finds that
important information relating to a minor child should not be withheld, either
inadvertently or purposefully, from the childs parent, including information
relating to the minor childs health, well-being, and education, while the
minor child is in the custody of the school district.  The Legislature finds it
is necessary to establish a consistent mechanism for parents to be notified of
information relating to the health and well-being of their minor children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Clinical laboratory means a
laboratory licensed by the Department of Health, pursuant to the &quot;New
Jersey Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act,&quot; P.L.1975, c.166 (C.45:9-11

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Health care
facility&quot; means a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971,
c.136 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Health care
provider&quot; means a physician, physician assistant, nurse, or other health
care professional whose professional practice is regulated pursuant to Title 45
of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>     &quot;Minor
child&quot; means a child under the age of 18 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:150%'>     &quot;Parent&quot;
means a person who has legal custody of a minor child as the biological parent,
adoptive parent, or legal guardian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  The State, any of its
political subdivisions, any governmental entity, or any other institution shall
not infringe on the fundamental rights of a parent to direct the upbringing,
education, health care and mental health of the parents minor child without
demonstrating that such action is reasonable and necessary to achieve a
compelling State interest and that such action is narrowly tailored and is not
otherwise served by a less restrictive means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  All rights are

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the right to apply to
enroll the parents minor child in a public school or, as an alternative to
public education, a private school, including a religious school, a home
education program, or any other available options permitted by law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  the right to enroll the
parents minor child in a school outside of the public school system if the

Act, Pub.L. 114-95;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  the right to access and

by law or authorized pursuant to a court order;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  the right to consent in
writing before the State or any its political subdivisions, any governmental
entity, or any other institution make a video or voice recording of the
parents minor child unless such recording is made during or as part of a court
proceeding or a forensic interview in a criminal or Department of Children and
Families investigation, or to be used solely for the following purposes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  a safety demonstration,
