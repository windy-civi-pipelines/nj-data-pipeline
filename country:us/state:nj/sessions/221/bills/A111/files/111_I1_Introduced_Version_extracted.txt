The commissioner would additionally be required to create a parallel Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare Internet website with the same content provided entirely in the Spanish language, and with a Spanish-language domain name to ensure easy Internet access by Spanish-speaking State residents. The bill would also require the commissioner to create a multimedia public awareness campaign, presented in English and Spanish, publicizing the Internet websites created pursuant to this bill. This bill aims to increase awareness and access to the Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs for underserved populations in this State, especially those for whom Spanish is a primary language. The bill would take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following enactment, to provide ample time for the Department of Human Services to create the two Internet websites and the public awareness campaign.
