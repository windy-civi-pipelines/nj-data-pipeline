As used in this section member of the press or media means an accredited member of the press corps or media; a photographer or photojournalist employed by a newspaper, magazine, or other media company; or an individual operating equipment to facilitate the delivery of news or media. (cf: P.L. 2020, c.73, s.1) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends N.J.S.A.2C:16-1, the crime of bias intimidation, to specifically provide that members of the press or media are within the protected classes set forth in the statute. Current law enumerates the protected classes of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, ethnicity.  Under the provisions of this section, a person may be guilty of the crime of bias intimidation if  he commits, attempts, conspires, or threatens the immediate commission of certain specified offenses with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group because of race, color, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, or ethnicity or knowing that the conduct would cause an individual or group to be intimidated on that basis or under circumstances in which the victim believes he was targeted on that basis.  The bill provides that member of the press or media means an accredited member of the press corps or media; a photographer or photojournalist employed by a newspaper, magazine, or other media company; or an individual operating equipment to facilitate the delivery of news or media. This bill is modeled after legislation recently introduced in Florida concerning offenses against members of the press.
