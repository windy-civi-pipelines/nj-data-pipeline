provided for by this Title, a registered voter shall be permitted to vote at a

general elections in this State. This procedure shall be known as early voting.
The early voting period shall:</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     (1)   start on the 4th calendar day before a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillLanguage><span
style='font-style:normal'>     The voting process during the early voting
period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and optical-scan voting
machines that read hand-marked paper ballots or other voting machines that
produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot. Any municipality conducting regular
municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the &quot;Uniform
Nonpartisan Elections Law,&quot; P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et seq.), may, by
an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early voting for the
regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of this act,
P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.). If adopted by a municipal governing body,
the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May shall start on
the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and end on the
second calendar day before that regular municipal election. An early voting
period shall only be permitted for a non-presidential or presidential primary
election and a general election in this State and, if adopted by a municipal
governing body, a regular municipal election conducted in May. Pursuant to the
provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and in accordance
with procedures that may be established by the Secretary of State for verifying
eligible voters, each county board of elections shall verify that a registered
voter is qualified to vote in the election and shall prescribe the manner by
which a registered voter may vote during such period.</span></span></p>

than seven, public locations for early voting if the number of registered
voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than 300,000, and shall
designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public locations for early
voting if the number of registered voters in the county is 300,000 or more.
This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county boards of elections,
at their discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the
five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set forth herein; provided,
however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the
costs of locations up to and including the five, seven, or 10 respective limits
established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for
additional locations beyond those limits under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021,
c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered voters in each county shall be
