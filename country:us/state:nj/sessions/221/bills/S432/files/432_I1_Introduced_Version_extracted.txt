STATEMENT This bill requires the Assistant Commissioner for the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services to establish guidelines for placing individuals with developmental disabilities in Level 1 and Level 2 group homes, as well as guidelines for transferring individuals with developmental disabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 group homes. Level 1 group homes are group homes for individuals with developmental disabilities who may have some minimal or challenging behavioral issues, but who are generally able to be safely placed with other individuals with developmental disabilities in a less-restrictive setting.  Level 2 group homes are group homes designed for individuals with developmental disabilities who present with persistent challenging behaviors that risk serious harm to self or others.  Under the bill, Level 2 group homes will be required to provide services designed to support the reintegration of residents into a less-restrictive treatment setting, such as a Level 1 group home. The bill outlines certain criteria to be included in the guidelines developed by the assistant commissioner, and additionally directs the assistant commissioner, to the extent appropriate, to seek to align the guidelines developed under the bill with existing guidelines for group home placements and transfers for individuals with developmental disabilities that have been developed by the Division of the Childrens System of Care in the Department of Children and Families. This bill was inspired by Aidan Burke, a young man with developmental disabilities who resides in a group home in New Jersey.  Aidan was assaulted by another resident with a history of challenging behaviors.  It is the sponsors intent to protect Aidan and all group home residents so they can be safe in their own homes.
