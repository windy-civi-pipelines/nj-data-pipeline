<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  a.  (Deleted by
amendment, P.L.2011, c.45)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Every rule adopted on or
after the effective date of P.L.2001, c.5 (C.52:14B-4.1a et al.) shall expire
seven years following the effective date of the rule unless a sooner expiration
date has been established for the rule.  The expiration date shall be included
in the adoption notice of the rule in the New Jersey Register and noted in the
New Jersey Administrative Code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) Notwithstanding any
other provision of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), or rule adopted
pursuant thereto, to the contrary, in the case of a proposed readoption without
changes to the existing rule, or a proposed readoption with technical changes
as approved by the Office of Administrative Law, an agency may continue in effect
an expiring rule for a seven-year period by filing a public notice with the
Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New Jersey Register at
least 30 days prior to the expiration date of the rule.  The notice pursuant to
this paragraph shall include the citation for the rule, a general description
of the rule, the specific legal authority under which the rule is authorized,
and the new expiration date of the rule.  The notice pursuant to this paragraph
shall be effective upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon the receipt of a public
notice pursuant to this paragraph, the Office of Administrative Law shall
publish the notice in the New Jersey Register.  The new expiration date of the
rule shall be noted in the New Jersey Administrative Code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this paragraph,
&quot;technical changes&quot; means changes to: correct spelling, grammar and
punctuation; correct codification; update contact information; or correct
cross-references.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In the case of a
proposed readoption of an expiring rule with substantive changes, an agency may
continue the expiring rule for a seven-year period by duly proposing the
readoption with substantive changes and readopting the rule prior to its
expiration.  Upon the filing of a notice of proposed readoption with
substantive changes, the expiration date of the rule shall be extended for 180
days, if such notice is filed prior to the expiration of the rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this paragraph,
&quot;substantive changes&quot; means any changes that are not technical
changes as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>

upon the request of an agency head, and prior to the expiration date of the
rule, continue in effect an expiring rule for a period to be specified by the
Governor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The Governor may, upon
the request of an agency head within five days after the expiration of a rule,
restore the effectiveness of an expired rule as of its expiration date, for a
period to be specified by the Governor, in order to effect the readoption of
the rule in accordance with subsection c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     This section shall not
apply to any rule repealing a rule or any rule prescribed by federal law or
whose expiration would violate any other federal or State law, in which case
the federal or State law shall be cited in the publication of the rule.</p>

the expiration of any rule under subsection b. of section 10 of P.L.2001, c.5
(C.52:14B-5.1) prior to the notice of proposed readoption without changes to an
existing rule, the proposed readoption with technical changes as approved by
the Office of Administrative Law to an existing rule, or the proposed
readoption with substantive changes to an existing rule, pursuant to subsection
c. of section 10 of P.L.2001, c.5 (C.52:14B-5.1), the agency shall complete a
review of the existing rule, in order to assess whether the benefits of the
rule continue to outweigh the costs and burdens of implementation of the rule
and whether the rule remains effective, has become outdated or an alternative
rule may better achieve the objective of the existing rule.  The agency shall
report the findings of the review to the Governor and Legislature pursuant to
section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1). The agency shall provide notice of
the reviews findings and availability of the review in the New Jersey Register

notice required by law, shall be published in the New Jersey Register.  Notice
shall also be distributed to the news media maintaining a press office to cover

notice of intent with respect to a proposed rule-making proceeding with the
Office of Administrative Law, for publication in the New Jersey Register at any
time prior to the formal notice of action required in subsection (a) of this
section. The notice shall be for the purpose of eliciting the views of
interested parties on an action prior to the filing of a formal rule proposal. 
Such notice shall be distributed to interested persons through the use of an
electronic mailing list or similar type of subscription-based e-mail service,
and made available for public viewing through publication on the agency's
Internet website.  The agency shall afford all interested persons a reasonable
opportunity to submit data, views, comments, or arguments, orally or in
writing, on the proposed action, and shall fully consider all written and oral
submissions, including any written submissions received by the agency through its
e-mail systems or electronic mailing lists.  An agency may use informal

also appoint committees of experts or interested persons or representatives of
the general public to advise it with respect to any contemplated rule-making.  </p>

the petition, giving a written statement of its reasons; (ii) grant the
petition and initiate a rule-making proceeding within 90 days of granting the
petition; or (iii) refer the matter for further deliberations which shall be
concluded within 90 days of referring the matter for further deliberations.  Upon
conclusion of such further deliberations, the agency shall either deny the
petition and provide a written statement of its reasons or grant the petition
and initiate a rule-making proceeding within 90 days.  Upon the receipt of the
petition, the agency shall file a notice stating the name of the petitioner and

written request by the petitioner, the Director of the Office of Administrative
Law shall order a public hearing on the rule-making petition and shall provide

the agency does not.  If the agency does not provide notice of a hearing within
15 days of the director's notice, the director shall schedule, and provide the
public with a notice of, that hearing at least 15 days prior thereto.  Hearing
notice shall also be made available for public viewing through publication on
the agency's Internet website.  If the public hearing is held by the Office of
Administrative Law, it shall be conducted by an administrative law judge, a
person on assignment from another agency, a person from the Office of
Administrative Law assigned pursuant to subsection o. of section 5 of P.L.1978,
c.67 <br>

petitioner and the agency shall participate in the public hearing and shall present
a summary of their positions on the petition, a summary of the factual
information on which their positions on the petition are based and shall
respond to questions posed by any interested party.  The hearing procedure
shall otherwise be consistent with the requirements for the conduct of a public
hearing as prescribed in subsection (g) of section 4 of P.L.1968, c.410

section 5 of P.L.1978, c.67 (C.52:14F-5) or an independent contractor.  The
hearing officer shall have the responsibility to make recommendations to the
agency regarding the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule. These
recommendations shall be made public.  At the beginning of each hearing, or
series of hearings, the agency, if it has made a proposal, shall present a
summary of the factual information on which its proposal is based, and shall
respond to questions posed by any interested party.  Hearings shall be
conducted at such times and in locations which shall afford interested parties
the opportunity to attend.  A verbatim record of each hearing shall be
maintained, and copies of the record shall be available to the public at no more
than the actual cost, which shall be that of the agency where the petition for
rule-making originated.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish a
mandatory review process for State agencies of any administrative rule or
regulation set to expire at the end of each seven-year period.  The review
would require State agencies to determine whether the benefits of the rule
continue to outweigh the costs and burdens of the rule, and whether the rule
remains effective or has become outdated.  The State agency would be required
to report its findings to the Governor and the Legislature, and to the public
in the New Jersey Register.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, this bill would
require State agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis of all proposed
administrative rules.  This analysis would be comparable to the review analysis
for existing rules, and the State agency proposing the rule would be required
to report its analysis to the Governor and the Legislature, and to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although present law mandates
that all administrative rules and regulations expire after a period of seven
years, there is no mandatory review process in place to determine the continued
efficacy of existing rules.  With respect to proposed administrative rules,
present law requires certain reviews to be conducted by State agencies prior to
adoption of rules, and this bill would expand the requirements placed upon a
State agency prior to adoption of any administrative rule. </p>
