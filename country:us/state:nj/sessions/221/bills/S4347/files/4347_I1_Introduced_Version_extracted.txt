(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are intended to codify and facilitate the enforcement of the implied warranty of habitability by the courts, and shall not be construed to hinder or limit the ongoing judicial construction and development of the implied warranty of habitability set forth in case law.  Tenants shall be entitled to assert and receive the maximum protections and remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, and nothing in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed as limiting a tenants right to seek the maximum protections possible from all sources of law.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A written lease shall clearly specify, in no smaller than 14-point font, the name, address, primary and emergency contact information, and email address, of the principal agent, who a tenant may contact for habitability violations, and serve with process for the purposes of an action brought pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which alleges a severe habitability violation.  A principal agent shall have an obligation to update the information required pursuant to this paragraph on a continuing basis.  The failure to receive service of process for a principal agents failure to update the information required pursuant to this paragraph shall not constitute a defense, affirmative or otherwise, in an action brought by the tenant pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  (1)  The Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or a tenant, may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against a landlord for a habitability violation, which remains unabated following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure, and shall be awarded all damages appropriate within the context of the violation, taking into account the duration and severity of the violation and other factors the court deems relevant.  A tenant: (a)  bringing an action pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to place any rent monies in escrow at the commencement of the action, but a court of competent jurisdiction may order a tenant to place rent monies in escrow as the court deems proper within the context of the violation; (b)   shall not be permitted to bring an action pursuant to this paragraph if the tenant is in arrears on any rent lawfully due and owing to the landlord, unless the rent in arrears, due and owing to the landlord, is withheld directly as a result of a habitability violation, after the tenant provided written notice to the landlord and provided a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation prior to withholding rent, or is withheld directly as a result of the tenants exercise of lawful statutory claims or defenses; and (c)   shall not bring an action pursuant to this paragraph or exercise any of the remedies set forth pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), if a landlord, following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure: authorizes a tenant to make the repairs necessary to cure the habitability violation and deduct the rent due and owing to the landlord that is necessary to make the repairs; or if a landlord and tenant, following the tenants written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure, agree in writing that a certain portion of the rent due and owing, deducted and withheld by a tenant after a tenant made the repairs necessary to cure a habitability violation, is in satisfaction of the rent following the tenants abatement of the habitability violation. (2)  Notwithstanding any damages awarded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or pursuant to any other remedy available to a tenant for a habitability violation, including all remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, if the court finds, by preponderance of the evidence, that a habitability violation exists, the tenant shall recover $1,000 from the landlord, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees; court costs; expenses for expert witnesses; and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving and abating a habitability violation.  Notwithstanding any damages awarded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or pursuant to any other remedy available to a tenant for a habitability violation, including all remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, if the court finds, by preponderance of the evidence, that a severe habitability violation exists, the tenant shall recover $2,000 from the landlord, and $2,000 from the principal agent, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees; court costs; expenses for expert witnesses; and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving and abating a habitability violation.  If the tenant proves, by preponderance of the evidence, a severe habitability violation exists, and the tenant has withheld a certain amount of rent to make the repairs, the tenant shall be awarded treble damages of the amount necessary to make the repairs. (3)  A court shall terminate, upon the request of a tenant, a lease or agreement containing a provision that waives the implied warranty of habitability, or any other habitability violation. (4)  A landlord shall be subject to the damages and remedies set forth in this subsection for each violation against each tenant. c.  (1)  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there exists a severe habitability violation, pursuant to an action brought by the Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or the tenant, pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the court shall order the landlord to abate the violation and shall specify a time period for the correction of the violation.  The order shall provide that, if the landlord does not comply with the order during the time period specified in the order, the program may abate the condition giving rise to the violation so as to comply with the order, at the cost of the landlord, and the program may expend funds provided to the program for such purpose and charge the same against the landlord.  The amount thereof shall be a lien against the premises. (2)   If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there exists a severe habitability violation, pursuant to an action brought by the tenant pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the court shall order the landlord to abate the violation and shall specify a time period for the correction of the violation.  The order shall provide that, if the landlord does not comply with the order during the time period specified in the order, the municipality in which the landlords unit is located, including a municipal enforcing agency or other similar agency of the municipality, may abate the condition giving rise to the violation so as to comply with the order, at the cost of the landlord and may expend funds for such purpose and charge the same against the landlord.  The amount thereof shall be a lien against the premises in the same manner that taxes are made a lien against land pursuant to Title 54 of the Revised Statutes, and the payment thereof shall be enforced within the same time, in the same manner, and by the same proceedings as the payment of taxes is otherwise enforced under Title 54 of the Revised Statutes. (3)   A principal agent of a landlord who is found liable for a severe habitability violation: (a)  is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree; and (b)  shall be personally liable in an action pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, and in accordance with section 5 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.  (New section)  A court may hold a landlord liable for a habitability violation pursuant to P.L.    , c.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided: a.     by preponderance of the evidence, a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there exists one or more severe habitability violations; and b.    notice of the action alleging a severe habitability violation has been issued to the principal agent, the registered agent of the landlord, each holder of a recorded mortgage, and other existing lienholders, if provided within the landlords registration information pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28) and, if applicable, section 12 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-12).  If the landlord is not registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), section 12 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-12, or both, then the notice required pursuant to this subsection shall only be required with respect to the principal agent. 6.  (New section)  a.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs, in coordination with the Administrative Director of the Courts, shall establish and maintain a habitability database, which shall include an index showing, and a file containing, with respect to each rental unit that is leased to a tenant: (1) information pertaining to landlord identification that is required to be submitted to the Department of Community Affairs by a landlord pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-12) or section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), or any other information that the commissioner determines necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2) any habitability violation that exists for the landlords rental unit or units as determined by a Judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Special Civil Part, or by a Judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, if the action was removed to the Law Division pursuant to N.J.S.2A:18-60, in a vicinage in this State, including units and multiple dwellings that are not subject to the present landlord-tenant action, whether asserted as a defense by a tenant, or pursuant to an action brought by a tenant in an action pursuant to P.L.1971, c.244 (C.2A:42-85 et seq.) or subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (3) each notice and order, violation, or citation issued for the landlords rental units, including units and multiple dwellings that are not subject to a pending landlord-tenant action, by the Department of Community Affairs or by the municipal department or enforcing agency having jurisdiction over buildings located in the respective municipality, that are related to: habitability; fire safety; health; utilities, including gas, water, or electricity; noise violations; and any other notice or order, violation, or citation determined necessary by the commissioner to include in the habitability database to effectuate the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.

(cf: P.L.1973, c.366, s.27) 11.  Section 1 of P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  If a residential lease agreement provides that the landlord is or may be entitled to recover either attorney's fees or expenses, or both, incurred as a result of the failure of the tenant to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease, or if the lease provides that such costs may be recovered as additional rent, the court shall read an additional parallel implied covenant into the lease.  This implied covenant shall require the landlord to pay the tenant either the reasonable attorney's fees or the reasonable expenses, or both, incurred by that tenant as the result of the tenant's successful defense of any action or summary proceeding commenced by the landlord against the tenant, arising out of an alleged failure of the tenant to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease, or as the result of any successful action or summary proceeding commenced by the tenant against the landlord, arising out of the failure of the landlord to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease. The court shall order the landlord to pay such attorney's fees or expenses, or both, that are actually and reasonably incurred by a tenant who is the successful party in such actions or proceedings to the same extent the landlord is entitled to recover attorney's fees and expenses, or both, as provided in the lease.  The court shall have discretion with respect to awards of attorney's fees or expenses, or both, for tenants to the same degree as it has with respect to awards of attorney's fees or expenses, or both, for landlords as provided under the lease either explicitly or implicitly.  An order based on this implied covenant shall require the landlord to pay the tenant such costs either as money damages or a credit against future rent, as determined by the tenant.  Any waiver of this section shall be void as against public policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in an action or summary proceeding for non-payment of rent a tenant who pays all rent currently due and owing on or after the filing of the complaint but prior to entry of a final judgment, and whom the court finds presented no meritorious defense to the complaint other than said payment, shall not be deemed to have successfully defended against the action or summary proceeding for the purposes of the award of attorney's fees or expenses, or both. b.  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1)  P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66 et seq.) shall apply to an action brought pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2)  reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, expenses for expert witnesses, and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving a habitability violation, as the term is defined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be awarded to a tenant of a landlord who, by preponderance of the evidence, is found liable for a habitability violation; and (3)  in addition to reasonable attorneys fees and other recoverable costs and expenses pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, 30 percent of any damages or penalties recovered shall be awarded to the attorney or attorneys that represent a tenant in an action brought by the Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or by a tenant, pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     As used in [this act] P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66 et seq.), "expenses" shall include expenses directly related to the litigation including, but not limited to, court costs and expenses for witnesses.  "Expenses" shall not include personal expenses for travel, reimbursement for missed work time, or child care. (cf: P.L.2013, c.206, s.1) 12.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall promulgate rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1, et seq.), that are necessary to effectuate and administer the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 13.  There is appropriated $5,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Community Affairs for the administration of the Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 14.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs and Administrative Director of the Courts may take anticipatory action necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill, known as the "Safeguarding Livable Units through Municipal Landlord Oversight and Regulation by DCA" or "SLUMLORD Act," strengthens protections for residential tenants for violations of the implied warranty of habitability and other code violations that severely affect the habitability of the tenants rental unit.  The bill requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish a Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program (program) in the Department of Community Affairs (department).  The bill also: codifies the implied warranty of habitability; authorizes a private cause of action for residential tenants (tenants) for habitability violations and provides certain remedies; imposes personal liability and criminal penalties on certain landlords and their agents for severe habitability violations; extends a tenants ability to recover attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from habitability violations; and establishes a habitability database to enhance the efficacy of the program. Specifically, the bill requires the establishment of the program to: provide information to tenants regarding habitability violations, as defined in the bill; and engage in litigation, through public-private partnerships, on behalf of tenants to enforce habitability violations.  The program would consist of a Tenant Advocate Service and Affirmative Litigation Initiative, which are not to expend resources representing residential tenants in defense of an eviction action, unless for certain cases involving reprisal. The bill codifies certain elements of the implied warranty of habitability and provides that the bill would not hinder or limit case law and the development of the common law doctrine of the implied warranty of habitability. The bill requires a landlord to designate at least one principal agent, as defined in the bill, who is to be the primary agent of the landlord for the purposes of complying with the bill, receiving habitability violation complaints from tenants, directing the property management company to abate violations, and, who is to be authorized to accept service of process from the registered agent or process server, receive confidential communications, and be personally and criminally liable for severe habitability violations, as defined in the bill.  The bill requires the principal agent to be, in addition to other criteria specified in the bill, a beneficial owner, which the bill defines in a manner similar to the federal "Corporate Transparency Act," pursuant to 31 U.S.C. s.5336(a)(3). The bill requires a written lease to clearly provide certain contact information of the principal agent, and the principal agent to continuously update this information as necessary. The bill provides a private cause of action and permits a tenant to bring an action alleging a habitability violation, which remains unabated following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure.  A tenant is not to bring an action pursuant to the bill if: (1) the tenant is in arrears on rent lawfully due and owing, unless the rent was directly withheld as a result of a habitability violation or a tenants exercise of lawful statutory claims or defenses; (2) a landlord authorizes a tenant to withhold rent monies necessary and sufficient to repair a habitability violation; or (3) the landlord and tenant agree that rent monies withheld and used by the tenant to repair a habitability violation are sufficient to remedy the violation and in satisfaction of the rent.   The bill authorizes the court to award all damages appropriate within the context of the violation, taking into account the duration and severity of the violation, and other factors the court deems relevant.  The bill specifies that for habitability violations, the landlord would be subject to the penalties set forth in the bill for each violation against each tenant. The bill further provides that a habitability violation is to constitute an unlawful practice pursuant to the New Jersey consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), and prescribes certain penalties depending on whether there exists a habitability violation or a severe habitability violation.  If a court determines that a severe habitability violation exists, the bill requires a court to order the landlord to abate the violation in a specified time period, which, if not timely abated, would enable the program, or the municipality in which the landlords unit is located, including a municipal enforcing agency or other similar agency of the municipality (municipality), to abate the condition giving rise to the violation, at the landlords expense, which expense would constitute a lien against the premises.  If the lien is held by the municipality, the lien is to be held and enforced in the same manner, time, and proceedings as taxes owed to the municipality pursuant to Title 54 of the Revised Statutes. The bill provides that a court may hold a principal agent personally liable for a severe habitability violation, as specified in the bill, and that such a violation is to be a crime of the fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. To facilitate the efficacy of the program, the bill requires the commissioner, in coordination with the Administrative Director of the Courts, to establish and maintain a habitability database, which is required to contain certain information pertaining to habitability violations, as described in the bill.  The information and violations would be classified by number, duration, and hazard level.  The bill requires the information to be electronically displayed or printed; made available for the court and all litigants for litigation concerning an alleged habitability violation, subject to the redaction of identifying information for those individuals and properties not subject to the pending litigation; and that the contents are to constitute prima facie evidence of any matter stated therein. The bill amends section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28) of the "Landlord Identity Law," to expand the information and individuals required to provide information for purposes of the certificate of registration, to include the principal agent, certain corporate officers and directors, and to facilitate the identification of a beneficial owner, as defined in the bill. Further, the bill amends P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66), which permits a tenant to recover attorneys fees to the same extent as the landlord, if the residential lease permits the landlord to recover attorneys fees for actions arising out of the lease.  The bill extends and modifies the tenants ability to recover attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from habitability violations. The bill appropriates $5 million from the General Fund to the Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program to effectuate the provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations that are necessary to effectuate and administer the provisions of the bill.  The bill would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the commissioner and the Administrative Director of the Courts would be permitted to take anticipatory action necessary to implement the provisions of the bill.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are intended to codify and facilitate the enforcement of the implied warranty of habitability by the courts, and shall not be construed to hinder or limit the ongoing judicial construction and development of the implied warranty of habitability set forth in case law.  Tenants shall be entitled to assert and receive the maximum protections and remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, and nothing in P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be construed as limiting a tenants right to seek the maximum protections possible from all sources of law.

(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A written lease shall clearly specify, in no smaller than 14-point font, the name, address, primary and emergency contact information, and email address, of the principal agent, who a tenant may contact for habitability violations, and serve with process for the purposes of an action brought pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which alleges a severe habitability violation.  A principal agent shall have an obligation to update the information required pursuant to this paragraph on a continuing basis.  The failure to receive service of process for a principal agents failure to update the information required pursuant to this paragraph shall not constitute a defense, affirmative or otherwise, in an action brought by the tenant pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  (1)  The Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or a tenant, may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction against a landlord for a habitability violation, which remains unabated following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure, and shall be awarded all damages appropriate within the context of the violation, taking into account the duration and severity of the violation and other factors the court deems relevant.  A tenant: (a)  bringing an action pursuant to this paragraph shall not be required to place any rent monies in escrow at the commencement of the action, but a court of competent jurisdiction may order a tenant to place rent monies in escrow as the court deems proper within the context of the violation; (b)   shall not be permitted to bring an action pursuant to this paragraph if the tenant is in arrears on any rent lawfully due and owing to the landlord, unless the rent in arrears, due and owing to the landlord, is withheld directly as a result of a habitability violation, after the tenant provided written notice to the landlord and provided a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation prior to withholding rent, or is withheld directly as a result of the tenants exercise of lawful statutory claims or defenses; and (c)   shall not bring an action pursuant to this paragraph or exercise any of the remedies set forth pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), if a landlord, following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure: authorizes a tenant to make the repairs necessary to cure the habitability violation and deduct the rent due and owing to the landlord that is necessary to make the repairs; or if a landlord and tenant, following the tenants written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure, agree in writing that a certain portion of the rent due and owing, deducted and withheld by a tenant after a tenant made the repairs necessary to cure a habitability violation, is in satisfaction of the rent following the tenants abatement of the habitability violation. (2)  Notwithstanding any damages awarded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or pursuant to any other remedy available to a tenant for a habitability violation, including all remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, if the court finds, by preponderance of the evidence, that a habitability violation exists, the tenant shall recover $1,000 from the landlord, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees; court costs; expenses for expert witnesses; and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving and abating a habitability violation.  Notwithstanding any damages awarded pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection or pursuant to any other remedy available to a tenant for a habitability violation, including all remedies cumulatively available under State and federal statutory, administrative, and common law, if the court finds, by preponderance of the evidence, that a severe habitability violation exists, the tenant shall recover $2,000 from the landlord, and $2,000 from the principal agent, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees; court costs; expenses for expert witnesses; and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving and abating a habitability violation.  If the tenant proves, by preponderance of the evidence, a severe habitability violation exists, and the tenant has withheld a certain amount of rent to make the repairs, the tenant shall be awarded treble damages of the amount necessary to make the repairs. (3)  A court shall terminate, upon the request of a tenant, a lease or agreement containing a provision that waives the implied warranty of habitability, or any other habitability violation. (4)  A landlord shall be subject to the damages and remedies set forth in this subsection for each violation against each tenant. c.  (1)  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there exists a severe habitability violation, pursuant to an action brought by the Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or the tenant, pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the court shall order the landlord to abate the violation and shall specify a time period for the correction of the violation.  The order shall provide that, if the landlord does not comply with the order during the time period specified in the order, the program may abate the condition giving rise to the violation so as to comply with the order, at the cost of the landlord, and the program may expend funds provided to the program for such purpose and charge the same against the landlord.  The amount thereof shall be a lien against the premises. (2)   If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that there exists a severe habitability violation, pursuant to an action brought by the tenant pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the court shall order the landlord to abate the violation and shall specify a time period for the correction of the violation.  The order shall provide that, if the landlord does not comply with the order during the time period specified in the order, the municipality in which the landlords unit is located, including a municipal enforcing agency or other similar agency of the municipality, may abate the condition giving rise to the violation so as to comply with the order, at the cost of the landlord and may expend funds for such purpose and charge the same against the landlord.  The amount thereof shall be a lien against the premises in the same manner that taxes are made a lien against land pursuant to Title 54 of the Revised Statutes, and the payment thereof shall be enforced within the same time, in the same manner, and by the same proceedings as the payment of taxes is otherwise enforced under Title 54 of the Revised Statutes.

(cf: P.L.1973, c.366, s.27) 11.  Section 1 of P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  If a residential lease agreement provides that the landlord is or may be entitled to recover either attorney's fees or expenses, or both, incurred as a result of the failure of the tenant to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease, or if the lease provides that such costs may be recovered as additional rent, the court shall read an additional parallel implied covenant into the lease.  This implied covenant shall require the landlord to pay the tenant either the reasonable attorney's fees or the reasonable expenses, or both, incurred by that tenant as the result of the tenant's successful defense of any action or summary proceeding commenced by the landlord against the tenant, arising out of an alleged failure of the tenant to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease, or as the result of any successful action or summary proceeding commenced by the tenant against the landlord, arising out of the failure of the landlord to perform any covenant or agreement in the lease. The court shall order the landlord to pay such attorney's fees or expenses, or both, that are actually and reasonably incurred by a tenant who is the successful party in such actions or proceedings to the same extent the landlord is entitled to recover attorney's fees and expenses, or both, as provided in the lease.  The court shall have discretion with respect to awards of attorney's fees or expenses, or both, for tenants to the same degree as it has with respect to awards of attorney's fees or expenses, or both, for landlords as provided under the lease either explicitly or implicitly.  An order based on this implied covenant shall require the landlord to pay the tenant such costs either as money damages or a credit against future rent, as determined by the tenant.  Any waiver of this section shall be void as against public policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in an action or summary proceeding for non-payment of rent a tenant who pays all rent currently due and owing on or after the filing of the complaint but prior to entry of a final judgment, and whom the court finds presented no meritorious defense to the complaint other than said payment, shall not be deemed to have successfully defended against the action or summary proceeding for the purposes of the award of attorney's fees or expenses, or both. b.  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1)  P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66 et seq.) shall apply to an action brought pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (2)  reasonable attorneys fees, court costs, expenses for expert witnesses, and other related fees and expenses incurred in proving a habitability violation, as the term is defined pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be awarded to a tenant of a landlord who, by preponderance of the evidence, is found liable for a habitability violation; and (3)  in addition to reasonable attorneys fees and other recoverable costs and expenses pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, 30 percent of any damages or penalties recovered shall be awarded to the attorney or attorneys that represent a tenant in an action brought by the Affirmative Litigation Initiative on behalf of a tenant, or by a tenant, pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     As used in [this act] P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66 et seq.), "expenses" shall include expenses directly related to the litigation including, but not limited to, court costs and expenses for witnesses.  "Expenses" shall not include personal expenses for travel, reimbursement for missed work time, or child care. (cf: P.L.2013, c.206, s.1) 12.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall promulgate rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1, et seq.), that are necessary to effectuate and administer the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 13.  There is appropriated $5,000,000 from the General Fund to the Department of Community Affairs for the administration of the Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 14.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs and Administrative Director of the Courts may take anticipatory action necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill, known as the "Safeguarding Livable Units through Municipal Landlord Oversight and Regulation by DCA" or "SLUMLORD Act," strengthens protections for residential tenants for violations of the implied warranty of habitability and other code violations that severely affect the habitability of the tenants rental unit.  The bill requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish a Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program (program) in the Department of Community Affairs (department).  The bill also: codifies the implied warranty of habitability; authorizes a private cause of action for residential tenants (tenants) for habitability violations and provides certain remedies; imposes personal liability and criminal penalties on certain landlords and their agents for severe habitability violations; extends a tenants ability to recover attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from habitability violations; and establishes a habitability database to enhance the efficacy of the program. Specifically, the bill requires the establishment of the program to: provide information to tenants regarding habitability violations, as defined in the bill; and engage in litigation, through public-private partnerships, on behalf of tenants to enforce habitability violations.  The program would consist of a Tenant Advocate Service and Affirmative Litigation Initiative, which are not to expend resources representing residential tenants in defense of an eviction action, unless for certain cases involving reprisal. The bill codifies certain elements of the implied warranty of habitability and provides that the bill would not hinder or limit case law and the development of the common law doctrine of the implied warranty of habitability. The bill requires a landlord to designate at least one principal agent, as defined in the bill, who is to be the primary agent of the landlord for the purposes of complying with the bill, receiving habitability violation complaints from tenants, directing the property management company to abate violations, and, who is to be authorized to accept service of process from the registered agent or process server, receive confidential communications, and be personally and criminally liable for severe habitability violations, as defined in the bill.  The bill requires the principal agent to be, in addition to other criteria specified in the bill, a beneficial owner, which the bill defines in a manner similar to the federal "Corporate Transparency Act," pursuant to 31 U.S.C. s.5336(a)(3). The bill requires a written lease to clearly provide certain contact information of the principal agent, and the principal agent to continuously update this information as necessary. The bill provides a private cause of action and permits a tenant to bring an action alleging a habitability violation, which remains unabated following written notice to the landlord and a reasonable opportunity to cure.  A tenant is not to bring an action pursuant to the bill if: (1) the tenant is in arrears on rent lawfully due and owing, unless the rent was directly withheld as a result of a habitability violation or a tenants exercise of lawful statutory claims or defenses; (2) a landlord authorizes a tenant to withhold rent monies necessary and sufficient to repair a habitability violation; or (3) the landlord and tenant agree that rent monies withheld and used by the tenant to repair a habitability violation are sufficient to remedy the violation and in satisfaction of the rent.   The bill authorizes the court to award all damages appropriate within the context of the violation, taking into account the duration and severity of the violation, and other factors the court deems relevant.  The bill specifies that for habitability violations, the landlord would be subject to the penalties set forth in the bill for each violation against each tenant. The bill further provides that a habitability violation is to constitute an unlawful practice pursuant to the New Jersey consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), and prescribes certain penalties depending on whether there exists a habitability violation or a severe habitability violation.  If a court determines that a severe habitability violation exists, the bill requires a court to order the landlord to abate the violation in a specified time period, which, if not timely abated, would enable the program, or the municipality in which the landlords unit is located, including a municipal enforcing agency or other similar agency of the municipality (municipality), to abate the condition giving rise to the violation, at the landlords expense, which expense would constitute a lien against the premises.  If the lien is held by the municipality, the lien is to be held and enforced in the same manner, time, and proceedings as taxes owed to the municipality pursuant to Title 54 of the Revised Statutes. The bill provides that a court may hold a principal agent personally liable for a severe habitability violation, as specified in the bill, and that such a violation is to be a crime of the fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by imprisonment for up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. To facilitate the efficacy of the program, the bill requires the commissioner, in coordination with the Administrative Director of the Courts, to establish and maintain a habitability database, which is required to contain certain information pertaining to habitability violations, as described in the bill.  The information and violations would be classified by number, duration, and hazard level.  The bill requires the information to be electronically displayed or printed; made available for the court and all litigants for litigation concerning an alleged habitability violation, subject to the redaction of identifying information for those individuals and properties not subject to the pending litigation; and that the contents are to constitute prima facie evidence of any matter stated therein. The bill amends section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28) of the "Landlord Identity Law," to expand the information and individuals required to provide information for purposes of the certificate of registration, to include the principal agent, certain corporate officers and directors, and to facilitate the identification of a beneficial owner, as defined in the bill. Further, the bill amends P.L.2013, c.206 (C.2A:18-61.66), which permits a tenant to recover attorneys fees to the same extent as the landlord, if the residential lease permits the landlord to recover attorneys fees for actions arising out of the lease.  The bill extends and modifies the tenants ability to recover attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from habitability violations. The bill appropriates $5 million from the General Fund to the Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative Litigation Program to effectuate the provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations that are necessary to effectuate and administer the provisions of the bill.  The bill would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, except that the commissioner and the Administrative Director of the Courts would be permitted to take anticipatory action necessary to implement the provisions of the bill.
