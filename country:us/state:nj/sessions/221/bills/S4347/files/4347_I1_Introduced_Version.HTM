<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, known as the
&quot;Safeguarding Livable Units through Municipal Landlord Oversight and
Regulation by DCA&quot; or &quot;SLUMLORD Act,&quot; strengthens protections
for residential tenants for violations of the implied warranty of habitability
and other code violations that severely affect the habitability of the tenants
rental unit.  The bill requires the Commissioner of Community Affairs
(commissioner) to establish a Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative
Litigation Program (program) in the Department of Community Affairs
(department).  The bill also: codifies the implied warranty of habitability;
authorizes a private cause of action for residential tenants (tenants) for
habitability violations and provides certain remedies; imposes personal
liability and criminal penalties on certain landlords and their agents for
severe habitability violations; extends a tenants ability to recover
attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from habitability
violations; and establishes a habitability database to enhance the efficacy of
the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires the establishment of the program to: provide information to tenants
regarding habitability violations, as defined in the bill; and engage in
litigation, through public-private partnerships, on behalf of tenants to
enforce habitability violations.  The program would consist of a Tenant
Advocate Service and Affirmative Litigation Initiative, which are not to expend
resources representing residential tenants in defense of an eviction action,
unless for certain cases involving reprisal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill codifies certain
elements of the implied warranty of habitability and provides that the bill would
not hinder or limit case law and the development of the common law doctrine of
the implied warranty of habitability.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a landlord
to designate at least one principal agent, as defined in the bill, who is to be
the primary agent of the landlord for the purposes of complying with the bill,
receiving habitability violation complaints from tenants, directing the
property management company to abate violations, and, who is to be authorized
to accept service of process from the registered agent or process server,
receive confidential communications, and be personally and criminally liable
for severe habitability violations, as defined in the bill.  The bill requires
the principal agent to be, in addition to other criteria specified in the bill,
a beneficial owner, which the bill defines in a manner similar to the federal <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span>Corporate Transparency Act,<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span> pursuant to 31 U.S.C. s.5336(a)(3). 
The bill requires a written lease to clearly provide certain contact information
of the principal agent, and the principal agent to continuously update this
information as necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides a private
cause of action and permits a tenant to bring an action alleging a habitability
violation, which remains unabated following written notice to the landlord and
a reasonable opportunity to cure.  A tenant is not to bring an action pursuant
to the bill if: (1) the tenant is in arrears on rent lawfully due and owing,
unless the rent was directly withheld as a result of a habitability violation
or a tenants exercise of lawful statutory claims or defenses; (2) a landlord
authorizes a tenant to withhold rent monies necessary and sufficient to repair
a habitability violation; or (3) the landlord and tenant agree that rent monies
withheld and used by the tenant to repair a habitability violation are
sufficient to remedy the violation and in satisfaction of the rent.   The bill
authorizes the court to award all damages appropriate within the context of the
violation, taking into account the duration and severity of the violation, and
other factors the court deems relevant.  The bill specifies that for
habitability violations, the landlord would be subject to the penalties set
forth in the bill for each violation against each tenant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further provides that
a habitability violation is to constitute an unlawful practice pursuant to the
New Jersey consumer fraud act, <span lang=EN>P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.)</span>,
and prescribes certain penalties depending on whether there exists a habitability
violation or a severe habitability violation.  If a court determines that a
severe habitability violation exists, the bill requires a court to order the
landlord to abate the violation in a specified time period, which, if not
timely abated, would enable the program, or the municipality in which the
landlords unit is located, including a municipal enforcing agency or other
similar agency of the municipality (municipality), to abate the condition
giving rise to the violation, at the landlords expense, which expense would
constitute a lien against the premises.  If the lien is held by the
municipality, the lien is to be held and enforced in the same manner, time, and
proceedings as taxes owed to the municipality pursuant to Title 54 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a court
may hold a principal agent personally liable for a severe habitability
violation, as specified in the bill, and that such a violation is to be a crime
of the fourth degree.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by
imprisonment for up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To facilitate the efficacy of
the program, the bill requires the commissioner, in coordination<span
style='color:black'> with the Administrative Director of the Courts</span>, to <span
style='color:black'>establish and maintain a habitability database, which is
required to contain certain information pertaining to habitability violations,
as described in the bill.  The information and violations would be classified
by number, duration, and hazard level.  The bill requires the information to be
electronically displayed or printed; made available for the court and all
litigants for litigation concerning an alleged habitability violation, subject
to the redaction of identifying information for those individuals and
properties not subject to the pending litigation; and that the contents are to
constitute prima facie evidence of any matter stated therein.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     The
bill amends </span>section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28) of the <span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span>Landlord Identity Law,<span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>&quot;</span> to expand the information and
individuals required to provide information for purposes of the certificate of
registration, to include the principal agent, certain corporate officers and
directors, and to facilitate the identification of a beneficial owner, as
defined in the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black'>     Further,
the bill amends P.L.2013, c.206 (C.</span>2A:18-61.66), which permits a tenant
to recover attorneys fees to the same extent as the landlord, if the
residential lease permits the landlord to recover attorneys fees for actions
arising out of the lease.  The bill extends and modifies the tenants ability
to recover attorneys fees and certain costs to actions arising from
habitability violations.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill appropriates $5
million from the General Fund to the Habitability Enforcement and Affirmative
Litigation Program to effectuate the provisions of the bill.  The bill
authorizes the commissioner to promulgate rules and regulations that are
necessary to effectuate and administer the provisions of the bill.  The bill
would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment,
except that the commissioner and the Administrative Director of the Courts
would be permitted to take anticipatory action necessary to implement the
provisions of the bill. </p>
