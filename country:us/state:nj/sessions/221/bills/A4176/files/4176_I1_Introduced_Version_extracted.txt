(cf: P.L.2021, c.352, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would upgrade any simple assault committed against a sports official for a school- or community-sponsored youth sports event to an aggravated assault. Under the bill, a person commits aggravated assault if the person is clearly identifiable as being engaged in the performance of the duties of a sports official; or because of the persons status as a sports official.  The bill defines sports official as meaning any person who serves as a referee, umpire, timer, scorer, coach, athletic trainer, manager, or assistant for a school- or community-sponsored youth sports event, or serves in a similar capacity but may be known by a different title, whether the person is compensated or a volunteer. Under current law, an assault committed against a sports official would constitute a disorderly persons offense.  Under the bill, assault against a sports official would be upgraded to aggravated assault, which is a crime of the fourth degree if the official suffered no bodily injury, and a crime of the third degree if bodily injury occurred.  A crime of the fourth degree is potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. The changes to the law would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment.

For purposes of this paragraph, "driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner" shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely. As used in this subsection, "vessel" means a means of conveyance for travel on water and propelled otherwise than by muscular power. d.    A person who is employed by a facility as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-2) who commits a simple assault as defined in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection a. of this section upon an institutionalized elderly person as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.239 (C.52:27G-2) is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree. e.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2001, c.443) [.] f.     A person who commits a simple assault as defined in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection a. of this section in the presence of a child under 16 years of age at a school or community sponsored youth sports event is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.  The defendant shall be strictly liable upon proof that the offense occurred, in fact, in the presence of a child under 16 years of age.  It shall not be a defense that the defendant did not know that the child was present or reasonably believed that the child was 16 years of age or older.  The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to create any liability on the part of a participant in a youth sports event or to abrogate any immunity or defense available to a participant in a youth sports event.  As used in this act, "school or community sponsored youth sports event" means a competition, practice, or instructional event involving one or more interscholastic sports teams or youth sports teams organized pursuant to a nonprofit or similar charter or which are member teams in a youth league organized by or affiliated with a county or municipal recreation department and shall not include collegiate, semi-professional or professional sporting events. (cf: P.L.2021, c.352, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would upgrade any simple assault committed against a sports official for a school- or community-sponsored youth sports event to an aggravated assault. Under the bill, a person commits aggravated assault if the person is clearly identifiable as being engaged in the performance of the duties of a sports official; or because of the persons status as a sports official.  The bill defines sports official as meaning any person who serves as a referee, umpire, timer, scorer, coach, athletic trainer, manager, or assistant for a school- or community-sponsored youth sports event, or serves in a similar capacity but may be known by a different title, whether the person is compensated or a volunteer. Under current law, an assault committed against a sports official would constitute a disorderly persons offense.  Under the bill, assault against a sports official would be upgraded to aggravated assault, which is a crime of the fourth degree if the official suffered no bodily injury, and a crime of the third degree if bodily injury occurred.  A crime of the fourth degree is potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is potentially punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. The changes to the law would take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following enactment.
