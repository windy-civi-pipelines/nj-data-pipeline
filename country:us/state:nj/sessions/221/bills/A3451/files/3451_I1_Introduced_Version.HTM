of employers with less than 30 employees the right to be reinstated to
employment after taking paid or unpaid family leave, thus ensuring that all
workers who pay for family temporary disability leave insurance (FLI) will be
able to able to return to work after taking FLI benefits.  The extension is
phased in, with the threshold reduced to 20 employees upon the effective date
of the bill, 10 employees one year later, and the threshold is reduced to five
employees two years after the effective date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Once the phase-in is complete,
the bill extends to employees of employers with five or more employees, the
provision under current law that provides that a covered employee who takes FLI
benefits to care for a family member may not be retaliated against by their
employer refusing to reinstate them after the leave.  Currently, an employer
who employs less than 30 workers, and is thus exempt from the reinstatement
requirements of the Family Leave Act (FLA), is also exempt from the
reinstatement requirements of that provision.  By reducing this exemption, the
bill extends that provisions reinstatement rights to recipients of FLI
benefits even if their employers have less than 30 employees, in the same way
that provision currently provides that reinstatement protection for temporary
disability insurance recipients no matter how few employees the employer has.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Once fully phased in, the bill
also amends the FLA to make employers of five or more employees subject to that
laws requirement to reinstate leave takers, thereby extending that right of
reinstatement to employees of employers with five or more employees, whether or
not the employees receive FLI benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
employee who is eligible for both earned sick leave, and either temporary
disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits will have the
option of using either the earned sick leave or whichever is applicable of
temporary disability benefits or family temporary disability leave benefits,
and may select the order in which the different kinds of leave are taken, but
may not receive more than one kind of paid leave simultaneously during any
period of time.</p>
