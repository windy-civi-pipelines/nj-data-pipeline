AR28 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 28 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT AUTH District 39 (Bergen and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen Clifton, McGuckin, Bergen, Scharfenberger, Barranco, Rumpf, DiMaio, Assemblywoman Dunn, Assemblymen Simonsen, McClellan, Assemblywoman Matsikoudis, Assemblyman Peterson, Assemblywoman Flynn, Assemblymen S.Kean and Inganamort SYNOPSIS Urges federal government to approve construction of oil and natural gas pipelines within United States, including those that have been shut down or have had approval denied. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging the federal government to approve construction of oil and natural gas pipelines, including those that have been shut down or have had approval denied. Whereas, The United States relies, and will continue to rely for many years, on gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel despite the recent focus on renewable energy and alternative sources of energy; and Whereas, In order to fuel the countrys economy, the United States will need more oil and natural gas while also requiring additional alternative energy sources; and Whereas, Constructing more pipelines within the United States would help the country achieve greater energy independence and enhance national security by reducing reliance on energy from the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela; and Whereas, Oil from the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela comes with increased price volatility and requires partnerships with unstable regimes and leaders with competing political interests; and Whereas, Constructing more pipelines within the United States would also result in lower oil prices and provide a significant economic advantage to the United States; and Whereas, Pipelines are the safest way to transport fuel and are also the most environmentally secure method of doing so, as they emit far less pollution than the alternatives of trains or trucks; and Whereas, The Congressional Research Service, within the Library of Congress, estimates that transporting crude oil by pipeline is significantly more cost-effective than the transportation of crude oil by train or truck; and Whereas, The construction and operation of new pipelines would provide much-needed employment for citizens of the United States; and Whereas, The United States has achieved significant levels of energy independence in recent years, with domestic production of petroleum accounting for 94 percent of domestic consumption in 2019 and net imports reaching their lowest level since 1954; and Whereas, As oil reserves are dwindling in several major oil producing countries, the United States maintains the tenth largest proven oil reserves in the world and Canada maintains the third largest according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration with 98 percent of the oil exported by Canada in 2019 being sent to the United States; and Whereas, On March 29, 2019, President Trump issued a Presidential Permit to begin construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have connected the United States oil supply to oil fields in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta, providing oil to the United States at a rate of up to 830,000 barrels per day; and Whereas, Securing and fostering a mutually beneficial trade relationship with Canada, one of this countrys strongest allies and neighbors, with regard to these oil supplies, would have increased the countrys energy independence, lowered the cost of gasoline, produced up to 11,000 high-paying jobs for United States citizens, and resulted in more stable trade relationships; and Whereas, On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to revoke the permit for construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline; and Whereas, Halting the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and other large pipelines can result in global economic consequences; and Whereas, The recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, has forced the United States, and other European nations to impose strict economic sanctions on Russia, including decertifying the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline; and Whereas, The Nord Stream 2 Pipeline stretches for 1,200 kilometres from Vyborg, Russia through the Baltic Sea to Lubmin, Germany and was designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Western Europe; and Whereas, The decertification of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline will result in severe economic losses and minimize Russias geostrategic control over European nations through its supply of gas, however, it will likely also lead to global economic consequences; and Whereas, It is more important than ever for the United States to increase its energy independence; and Whereas, Based on the geopolitical, energy security, environmental, and economic benefits of oil and natural gas pipeline construction within the United States, it is in the countrys, and by extension New Jerseys, best interests to support the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines, including the approval of pipelines that have been shut down or disapproved, within the United States; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges the federal government to take action to approve the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines within the United States, including approving pipelines that have been shut down or disapproved. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President and Vice President of the United States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of the United States Department of Energy, and every member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution urges the federal government to take action to approve the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines within the United States, including approving pipelines that have been shut down or disapproved. The United States relies, and will continue to rely for many years, on gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel despite the recent focus on renewable energy and alternative sources of energy.  In order to fuel the countrys economy, the United States will need more oil and natural gas while also developing additional alternative energy sources. Constructing more pipelines within the United States would help the country achieve energy independence and enhance national security by reducing reliance on energy from the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela.  Constructing more pipelines within the United States would also result in lower oil prices and provide a significant economic advantage to the United States. Although the United States has achieved significant levels of energy independence in recent years, there is always room to improve the countrys energy independence.  Steps have been taken to create greater North American energy independence, including the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would have connected the United States oil supply to oil fields in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin in Alberta, providing oil at a rate of up to 830,000 barrels per day.  The Keystone XL Pipeline would have increased the United States energy independence, lowered the cost of gasoline, produced up to 11,000 high-paying jobs for United States citizens, and resulted in more stable trade relationships.  President Trump issued a Presidential Permit to begin construction on the cross-border segment of the Keystone XL Pipeline, however, the permit for this construction was revoked by President Biden.  The reapproval and continued construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline is very important for the energy independence of the United States. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia has resulted in global tension and fear.  The United States and other European nations have responded by enforcing strict economic sanctions on Russia.  One of the sanctions is the decertification of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline, which stretches for 1,200 kilometres from Vyborg, Russia through the Baltic Sea to Lubmin, Germany and was designed to carry natural gas from Russia to Western Europe.  The decertification of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline will likely also have global economic consequences.  It is more important than ever for the United States to become more energy independent. Based on the geopolitical, energy security, environmental, and economic benefits of oil and natural gas pipeline construction within the United States, it is in the countrys, and by extension New Jerseys, best interests to support the construction of oil and natural gas pipelines, including the approval of pipelines that have been shut down or disapproved, within the United States.
