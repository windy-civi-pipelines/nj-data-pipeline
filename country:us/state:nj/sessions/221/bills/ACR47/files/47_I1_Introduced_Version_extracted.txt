INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment would change the way that the affordable housing obligations of towns are determined.  Currently, these obligations are based on regional housing needs.  This amendment would remove that requirement.  The amendment instead requires that these obligations be based on the housing needs of the whole State. The amendment requires the Legislature to pass laws to create the process for calculating the affordable housing needs of the whole State.  This Statewide need would represent all the affordable housing required by the Constitution. STATEMENT This amendment to the State Constitution would require that the constitutional affordable housing obligation be calculated at the State level.  Currently, municipal affordable housing obligations mandated by the State Constitution are calculated based upon regional housing needs.  This amendment would eliminate that requirement. Accordingly, any affordable housing obligation placed on a municipality would no longer be based on regional housing needs.  Instead, this amendment would require the Legislature to pass laws providing for the calculation of the affordable housing needs of the entire State.  This single number calculation of affordable housing units needed Statewide would represent the exclusive affordable housing obligation required by the State Constitution.
