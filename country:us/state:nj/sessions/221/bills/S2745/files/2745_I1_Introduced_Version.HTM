under the gross income tax for certain home purchases during qualified periods,
supplementing chapter 4 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A first-time
homebuyer taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due
under the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.,
for a qualified home purchase, in an amount equal to five percent of the price
paid for the purchase or $15,000, whichever is less, and subject to the further
limitations imposed by this section; provided, however, that the taxpayer
intends to use the home as the taxpayers principal residence for 36
consecutive months next following the date of the qualified home purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The amount of all
credits allowed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $100,000,000, to be
allocated over four terms as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   up to $25,000,000 for
contracts of sale executed on or before the 365th day next following the
effective date of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   up to $25,000,000 for
contracts of sale executed after the 365th, but before the 730th, day next
following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before
the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Upon a joint resolution
adopted by the Senate and General Assembly and signed by the Governor that
extends the tax credit program, as prescribed by subsection g. of this section,
the balance of credits allowed pursuant to an extension of the tax credit
program shall be allocated as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   up to $25,000,000 for
contracts of sale executed on or before the 365th day next following the date
the Governor signs the joint resolution; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   up to $25,000,000 for
contracts of sale executed after the 365th, but before the 730th, day next
following the date the Governor signs the joint resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   For each term in which
credits are allowed pursuant to this subsection, up to $18,750,000 shall be
allowed for qualified home purchases of new qualified residential properties,
and up to $6,250,000 shall be allowed for qualified home purchases of qualified
residential properties previously occupied as a residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The director shall
establish a convenient method, which may include an Internet or other
electronic format, for first-time homebuyer taxpayers to apply for a
determination of their preliminary eligibility to claim a credit, which
determination shall be provided by the director to the taxpayer before the
taxpayers intended purchase date.  Notice of the directors determination of
preliminary eligibility or denial of preliminary eligibility to claim a credit
shall be provided to applicants in the order in which the director receives the
applications, and the limits provided in this subsection shall be allocated to
applications in the order in which they are received and approved by the
director.  No credit shall be allowed under this section for a home purchase if
a determination of preliminary eligibility of that home purchase is not
provided by the director.  The application shall include such information as
the director determines is necessary to make a prompt determination of
preliminary eligibility and shall include, but may not be limited to: (1) the
taxpayers certification of intention to use the home as the taxpayers
principal residence for 36 consecutive months after the qualified home
purchase; and (2) in the case of a qualified home purchase of a new qualified
residential property, the home sellers certification that the new qualified
residential property has never been occupied as a principal residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)     A first-time
homebuyer taxpayer completing a qualified home purchase of a qualified
residential property previously occupied as a residence within 365 days
following the date of the execution of the contract of sale may claim a credit
allowed pursuant to this section.  To reserve a credit, the taxpayer and seller
shall jointly sign and submit to the director a certification that they have
entered into a fully executed contract of sale.  Upon receipt of the
certification, the director shall notify the taxpayer that the division has
reserved the credit for the taxpayer, pending the directors receipt from the
taxpayer, within 14 calendar days of settlement, of the Closing Disclosure for
the qualified home purchase of a qualified residential property previously
occupied as a residence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A first-time homebuyer
taxpayer completing a qualified home purchase of a new qualified residential
property within 545 days following the date of the execution of the contract of
sale may claim a credit allowed pursuant to this section.  To reserve a credit,
the taxpayer and seller shall jointly sign and submit to the director a
certification that they have entered into a fully executed contract of sale. 
Upon receipt of the certification, the director shall notify the taxpayer that
the division has reserved the credit for the taxpayer, pending the directors
receipt from the taxpayer, within 14 calendar days of settlement, of the
Closing Disclosure for the qualified home purchase of a new qualified
residential property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The total amount of the
credit allowed shall be divided and applied in equal amounts for three
consecutive taxable years, beginning in the taxable year of the purchase and
continuing in the next two taxable years.  The amount of the credit allowed
shall be applied against the tax otherwise due under N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. in
each taxable year after all other credits and payments allowed in the taxable
year.  If the credit allowed reduces the tax liability otherwise due to zero,
any amount of the credit remaining shall be paid to the taxpayer as a refund of
an overpayment of tax pursuant to N.J.S.54A:9-7, provided however, subsection
(f) of that section, concerning the allowance of interest, shall not apply. 
The director shall determine the form and manner by which a first-time
homebuyer taxpayer shall apply for and be eligible to receive a refund of an
overpayment pursuant this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     (1)  A taxpayer shall

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the New
Jersey Homebuyer Tax Credit Program under the gross income tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To qualify for the credit, a
taxpayer is required to: (1) be a first-time homebuyer; and (2) enter into a
contract of sale on a qualified home purchase within certain prescribed dates. 
For qualifying new home purchases, a taxpayer has 18 months from the contract
of sale in which to complete the purchase.  For qualifying previously occupied
homes, a taxpayer has 12 months from the contract of sale in which to complete
the purchase.  The taxpayer is also required to occupy the property as her or
his principal residence for at least three consecutive years after the date of
the purchase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The tax credit provided by the
bill is refundable and is allowed for up to $15,000 or five percent of the
purchase price, whichever is less.  The total credits available are capped at
$100 million, with up to $25 million allocated for qualified home purchases
made between the effective date of the bill and up to one year thereafter; and
up to $25 million allocated for qualified home purchases made after one year,
but before two years, after the effective date of the bill.  If the tax credit
program is renewed, up to $25 million is available for qualified home purchases
made up to one year after the renewal date; and up to $25 million is available
for qualified purchases made between one year, but before two years, after the
date the program is renewed.  For each year the program is in effect, up to
$18.75 million is allocated for purchases of newly constructed homes not
previously occupied, and up to $6.25 million is allocated for purchases of previously
occupied homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The credit is only available
to taxpayers who are New Jersey residents, are natural persons, and have not
previously owned qualified residential property.  Moreover, the New Jersey
reported gross income of the taxpayer, combined with the New Jersey reported
gross income of other individuals expected to be permanent residents of the
property (domiciled for more than 180 days of the year), cannot exceed: (1)
$118,000 for households with up to two persons; and (2) $135,000 for households
with three or more persons. The value of the qualified residential property
likewise cannot exceed $560,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The credit is provided on a
first-come, first-serve basis, and the claiming of the credit for personal
income tax filing purposes will be divided into three equal credit amounts
claimed over three taxable years.  The terms of the credit require that the
home continue to be occupied as the taxpayer's principal residence for three
years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the taxpayer fails to use
the home as his or her principal residence for at least 36 months next
following the date of the qualified home purchase, then the taxpayer must pay
back the full amount of the credit received.  Likewise, if the Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury determines that a
taxpayer has used a strawman to make more than one qualified home purchase, in
order to flip houses and claim multiple credits pursuant to the bill, then
the taxpayer is required to pay back the full amount of all credits received;
this prohibition is not intended to preclude the use of a real estate agent or
broker in facilitating a qualified home purchase.  In the event the taxpayer
dies during the 36 months the qualified residential property is required to be
used as the taxpayers principal residence, then any heirs to whom the property
has been bequeathed are required to: (1) meet the definition of first-time
homebuyer taxpayer; and (2) use the property as that heirs or heirs
principal residence for the balance of the 36 months; otherwise, the credit is
disallowed for all tax years beginning after the death of the original
purchaser/taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After the end of the second
year in which this program is operational, the Office of Revenue and Economic
Analysis in the Department of the Treasury is required to prepare and submit a
report to the Governor and Legislature to study the efficacy of the tax credit
program.  This report, at a minimum, is required to include: (1) the impact of
the tax credit program on State revenue; (2) the extent to which home purchases
by first time homebuyers (including purchases of new qualified residential
property) increased during the period the tax credits were available; (3)
whether the data suggests that a two year extension of the tax credit program
may have a material, positive impact on the States construction, real estate,
and any other sectors of the State economy; and (4) whether the fiscal
condition and outlook of the State has materially changed in way that
materially affect the purpose underlying the program to promote home ownership
and strengthen key sectors of the States economy.  Upon receipt of this
report, the Legislature may adopt, and the Governor may sign, a joint
resolution that extends the program for two additional years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The effective date of this
bill is the first day of the sixth month next following the date of enactment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is intended to create
a substantial and immediate incentive for potential homebuyers.  Recognizing
that much direct and indirect economic activity is generated through new home
construction and home resales, this incentive is expected not only to
strengthen homebuilding industry in this State, but also to stimulate economic
growth through indirect related spending, including boosting State and local
government revenue collections generated by this activity.</p>
