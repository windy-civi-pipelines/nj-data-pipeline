Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature affirms
that the preservation of responsible government requires that the fullest
opportunity be afforded to the people of the State to petition their local
governments for the redress of grievances and to express freely to individual
members of the local governing bodies, to governing bodies at all local
government levels, and to their local chief executives their opinion on local
measures and current issues; to local government officers and agencies their
opinion on local rules and regulations developed and promulgated by those
officers and agencies in the exercise of powers delegated to them by law; and
to the local chief executives and local government officers and agencies their
opinion on matters involving the administration of various local governmental
processes by the chief executives and those officers and agencies in the
exercise of powers delegated to them by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature finds,
however, that the preservation and maintenance of the integrity of the process
for the adoption of local measures, of the local regulatory process, and of the
local governmental process, including the development and promulgation of local
rules and regulations or the administration of various local governmental
processes to effectuate the implementation of law, requires the identification
in certain instances of persons and groups who seek to influence the content,
introduction, passage or defeat of local measures, the proposal, adoption,
amendment, or repeal of local rules and regulations or the administration of
various local governmental processes, and, where it is not otherwise apparent
or readily ascertainable, the nature of the interest which those persons and
groups seek to advance or protect through such activity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is in the public interest
to closely monitor the activities of governmental affairs agents and lobbyists
with respect to their involvement in influencing the adoption of local measures
and local regulatory and governmental processes to ensure the integrity of
government.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Therefore, it is the purpose
of this act, P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill), to require adequate disclosure in certain instances in order to make
available to the Legislature, local governmental officials and the public
information relative to the activities of persons who seek to influence the
content, introduction, passage or defeat of local measures, the proposal,
adoption, amendment or repeal of local rules and regulations or the
administration of various local governmental processes by such means. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    This act shall be known
as the &quot;Local Governmental Process Activities Disclosure Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    For the purposes of this

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   in the case of an
