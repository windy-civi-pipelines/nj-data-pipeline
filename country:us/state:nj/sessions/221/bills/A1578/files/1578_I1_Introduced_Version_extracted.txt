[No] A recalled judge shall not serve beyond his 80th birthday. Upon [such] recall the retired judge shall have all the powers of a judge of compensation and shall be paid a per diem allowance [fixed by the Director/Chief Judge of the Division of Workers' Compensation] in the sum of $750.  In addition the recalled judge shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses actually incurred by him in connection with [his] the judges assignment and shall be provided with such facilities as may be required in the performance of [his] the judges duties. [Such] The per diem compensation and expenses shall be paid by the State.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.6, s.3) 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases the per diem allowance of recalled judges to $750. Under current law, the per diem allowance for recalled judges is fixed by the relevant court.  This means that: pursuant to N.J.S.A.52:14F-4, for recalled administrative law judges, the allowance is fixed by the Director or Chief Administrative Law Judge; pursuant to N.J.S.A.43:6A-13, for recalled Supreme Court justices, the allowance is fixed by Supreme Court in accordance with its rules; and pursuant to N.J.S.A.34:15-49, for recalled Workers Compensation judges, the allowance is fixed by the Director or Chief Judge of the Workers Compensation Division. This bill would set the per diem allowance for each of these recalled judges at $750 and remove the authority of the relevant court to set the per diem allowance for recalled judges of these courts.
