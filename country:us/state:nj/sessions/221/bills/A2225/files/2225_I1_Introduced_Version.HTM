Each applicant shall submit the applicant's name, address, and written consent to the director for a criminal history record background check to be performed.  The division is authorized to receive criminal history record information from the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Upon receipt of such notification, the division shall forward the information to the appropriate board which shall make a determination regarding the issuance of licensure. The applicant shall bear the cost for the criminal history record background check, including all costs of administering and processing the check, unless otherwise provided for by an individual enabling act.  The Division of State Police shall promptly notify the division in the event an applicant or licensee, who was the subject of a criminal history record background check pursuant to this section, is convicted of a crime or offense in this State after the date the background check was performed. For purposes of this act: "Completed application" means the submission of all of the information designated on the checklist, adopted pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1991, c.421 (C.13:1D-101), for the class or category of permit for which application is made. "Permit" has the same meaning as defined in section 1 of P.L.1991, c.421 (C.13:1D-101). (cf: P.L.2003, c.199, s.31) 2.    (New section)    a.   Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, a board shall not disqualify a person from obtaining or holding any certificate, registration or license issued by a board solely because of a prior conviction of a crime, unless the crime directly relates to the profession or occupation regulated by the board. In determining if a prior conviction directly relates to the profession or occupation, a board shall consider the following: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crime and the passage of time since its commission; (2)   the relationship of the crime to the purposes of regulating the profession or occupation regulated by the board; (3)   any evidence of rehabilitation of the person in the period of time following the prior conviction; and (4)   the relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity, and fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the profession or occupation regulated by the board. b.    A board shall not disqualify a person from obtaining or holding a certificate, registration or license issued by the board because of a persons prior conviction of a crime unless it provides the person with a written notice that the board has determined that the conviction may disqualify the person, demonstrates the connection between the conviction and the profession or occupation regulated by the board, and affords the person an opportunity to be heard before the board prior to the board making a final decision on whether to disqualify the person.  If, after the person is heard before the board, the person is disqualified for a certificate, registration or license, the board shall notify the person in writing of the following: (1)   the grounds and reasons for the denial or disqualification; (2)   the earliest date the person may reapply for the certificate, registration or license; and (3)   that evidence of rehabilitation may be considered upon reapplication. c.     If a persons prior conviction was for any sex offense that would qualify the person for registration pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1994, c.133 (C.2C:7-2) or under an equivalent statute of another state or jurisdiction, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that a direct relationship exists between the crime and the profession or occupation regulated by the board. 3.    (New section)   The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall obtain data concerning the number of, and reasons for, disqualification by any board pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and annually submit a report to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), that provides the disqualification data for each board. 4.    This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment, except that the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires professional and occupational boards in the Division of Consumer Affairs, when determining whether a person is disqualified from certification, registration or licensure because of a prior conviction of a crime, to consider whether the crime directly relates to the profession or occupation regulated by the board. Current law permits a board to refuse to admit a person to an examination or refuse to issue or to suspend or revoke any certificate, registration or license issued by the board upon proof that the applicant or holder of such certificate, registration or license has been convicted of, or engaged in acts constituting, any crime or offense involving moral turpitude or relating adversely to the activity regulated by the board. The bill amends this standard of proof in current law to delete the reference to a crime or offense involving moral turpitude, and requires that the crime or offense be directly related to the activity regulated by the board, rather than adversely related. In addition, the bill supplements current law to provide that no person will be disqualified from obtaining or holding any certificate, registration or license issued by a board solely because of a prior conviction of a crime, unless the crime directly relates to the profession or occupation regulated by the board.  In determining whether a crime or offense directly relates to the activity regulated by the board, a board must consider the following: (1)   the nature and seriousness of the crime and the passage of time since its commission; (2)   the relationship of the crime to the purposes of regulating the profession or occupation regulated by the board; (3)   any evidence of rehabilitation of the person in the period of time following the prior conviction; and (4)   the relationship of the crime to the ability, capacity, and fitness required to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of the profession or occupation regulated by the board. The bill provides that a board may not disqualify a person from obtaining or holding a certificate, registration or license issued by the board because of a persons prior conviction of a crime unless it provides the person with a written notice that the board has determined that the conviction may disqualify the person, demonstrates the connection between the conviction and the profession or occupation regulated by the board, and affords the person an opportunity to be heard before the board prior to the board making a final decision on whether to disqualify the person.  If the boards final decision is to disqualify the person, the board must notify the person in writing as to the grounds and reasons for the disqualification, the earliest date upon which the person may reapply, and that evidence of rehabilitation may be considered upon reapplication. The bill also provides that a persons prior conviction for any sex offense that would qualify the person for registration under Megans Law, or under an equivalent statute of another state or jurisdiction, creates a rebuttable presumption that a direct relationship exists between the prior conviction and the profession or occupation regulated by the board. Finally, the bill requires the division to obtain data concerning the number of, and reasons for, disqualification by any board pursuant to the provisions of the bill, and annually submit a report to the Legislature that provides the disqualification data for each board.
