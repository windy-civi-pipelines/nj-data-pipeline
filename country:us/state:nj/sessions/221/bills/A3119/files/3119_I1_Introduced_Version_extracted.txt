CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the construction of school facilities projects, supplementing P.L.2000, c.72 (18A:7G-1 et al.), chapter 18A of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.,), P.L.2011, c.176 (C.18A:36C-1 et seq.), and P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-1 et seq.), and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 2 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The Constitution of the State of New Jersey requires the Legislature to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools and this legislative responsibility includes ensuring that students are educated in physical facilities that are safe, healthy, and conducive to learning. b.    Inadequacies in the quality, utility, and safety of educational facilities have arisen among local school districts of this State.  In order to ensure that the Legislature's constitutional responsibility for adequate educational facilities is met, there is a need to establish an efficiency standard for educational facilities at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels which will assure that the core curriculum content standards are taught to all of the children of the State in a setting which facilitates and promotes that learning. c.     Educational infrastructure inadequacies are greatest in the SDA districts where maintenance has been deferred and new construction has not been initiated due to concerns about cost.  To remedy the facilities inadequacies of the SDA districts, the State must promptly engage in a facilities needs assessment and fund the entire cost of repairing, renovating, and constructing the new school facilities determined by the Commissioner of Education to be required to meet the school facilities efficiency standards in the SDA districts.  In other districts, the State must also identify need in view of anticipated growth in school population, and must contribute to the cost of the renovation and construction of new facilities to ensure the provision of a thorough and efficient education in those districts. d.    While providing that the educational infrastructure meets the requirements of a thorough and efficient education, the State must also protect the interests of taxpayers who will bear the burden of this obligation.  Design of school facilities should incorporate maximum operating efficiencies and new technologies to advance the energy efficiency of school facilities and the efficiency of other school building systems, construction should be achieved in as efficient a manner as possible while also ensuring that public funds spent on the construction of school facilities support a skilled workforce compensated at dignified wages, and a mechanism to assure proper maintenance of new facilities should be established and implemented, in order to reduce the overall cost of the program and to preserve this infrastructure investment.

The development authority shall undertake and the financing authority shall finance the school facilities projects of SDA districts. b.   In the case of a district other than an SDA district, State support for the project shall be determined pursuant to section 9 or section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9 or C.18A:7G-15), as applicable. c.   Notwithstanding any provision of N.J.S.18A:18A-16 to the contrary, the procedures for obtaining approval of a school facilities project shall be as set forth in P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.); provided that any district whose school facilities project is not constructed by the development authority shall also be required to comply with the provisions of N.J.S.18A:18A-16 and, in the case of a school facilities project that has estimated total costs over $10,000,000, shall be overseen by a non-conflicted construction management service provider, which holds a current, valid classification issued by the Division of Property Management and Construction in the Department of Treasury pursuant to its classification processes for construction managers, who shall serve from initial application to the commissioner for approval of the project through project completion. d.   (1) Any district seeking to initiate a school facilities project shall apply to the commissioner for approval of the project.  The application may include, but not be limited to: a description of the school facilities project; a schematic drawing of the project or, at the option of the district, preliminary plans and specifications; a delineation and description of each of the functional components of the project; educational specifications detailing the programmatic needs of each proposed space; the number of unhoused students to be housed in the project; the area allowances per FTE student as calculated pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-8); and the estimated cost to complete the project as determined by the district. (2)  (a) In the case of an SDA district school facilities project, based upon its educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan established pursuant to subsection m. of this section, the commissioner may authorize the development authority to undertake preconstruction activities which may include, but need not be limited to, site identification, investigation, and acquisition, feasibility studies, land-related design work, design work, site remediation, demolition, and acquisition of temporary facilities. Upon receipt of the authorization, the development authority may initiate the preconstruction activities required to prepare the application for commissioner approval of the school facilities project. Site remediation and demolition preconstruction activities undertaken by the development authority pursuant to this subparagraph shall be included as part of the project charter of the SDA district school facilities project, which project charter covers all other construction activities of the school facilities project. (b) In the case of an SDA district school facilities project, the project design shall conform to the standards of the model school design program developed by the development authority pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection h. of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4). The development authority may permit an SDA district school facilities project to include design features that are considered excess costs provided that the design features do not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of total estimated project costs or $2,000,000. (c) In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the project design of a school facilities project may conform to the standards of the model school design program developed by the development authority pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection h. of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4). e.   The commissioner shall review each proposed school facilities project to determine whether it is consistent with the district's long-range facilities plan and whether it complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards; and in the case of an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan developed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection m. of this section and whether the project conforms to the standards of the model school design program; and in the case of a district other than an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's priority pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection m. of this section.  The commissioner shall make a decision on a district's application within 90 days from the date the commissioner determines that the application is fully and accurately completed and that all information necessary for a decision has been filed by the district, or from the date of the last revision made by the district. If the commissioner is not able to make a decision within 90 days, the commissioner shall notify the district in writing explaining the reason for the delay and indicating the date on which a decision on the project will be made, provided that the date shall not be later than 60 days from the expiration of the original 90 days set forth in this subsection. If the decision is not made by the subsequent date indicated by the commissioner, then the project shall be deemed approved and the preliminary eligible costs for new construction shall be calculated by using the proposed square footage of the building as the approved area for unhoused students. f.    If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the district's long-range facilities plan and does not exceed the area allowance per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs of the project pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7); except that (1) in the case of a county special services school district or a county vocational school district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the amount determined by the board of school estimate and approved by the board of chosen freeholders pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1971, c.271 (C.18A:46-42) or N.J.S.18A:54-31 as appropriate, and (2) in the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the estimated cost as determined by the development authority. g.   If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project is inconsistent with the facilities efficiency standards or exceeds the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall notify the district. (1)  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates that school facilities needs related to required programs cannot be addressed within the facilities efficiency standards and that all other proposed spaces are consistent with those standards.  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the additional area allowances are necessary to accommodate centralized facilities to be shared among two or more school buildings within the district and the centralized facilities represent a more cost effective alternative. (2)  The commissioner may waive a facilities efficiency standard if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that the waiver will not adversely affect the educational adequacy of the school facility, including the ability to deliver the programs and services necessary to enable all students to achieve the core curriculum content standards. (3)  To house the district's central administration, a district may request an adjustment to the approved areas for unhoused students of 2.17 square feet for each FTE student in the projected total district school enrollment if the proposed administrative offices will be housed in a school facility and the district demonstrates either that the existing central administrative offices are obsolete or that it is more practical to convert those offices to instructional space.  To the extent that existing administrative space will continue to be used for administrative purposes, the space shall be included in the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7). If the commissioner approves excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs based upon the additional area allowances or excess facilities efficiency standards pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7).  In the event that the commissioner does not approve the excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances, the district may either: modify its submission so that the school facilities project meets the facilities efficiency standards; or pay for the excess costs. (4)  The commissioner shall approve spaces in excess of, or inconsistent with, the facilities efficiency standards, hereinafter referred to as nonconforming spaces, upon a determination by the district that the spaces are necessary to comply with State or federal law concerning individuals with disabilities, including that the spaces are necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled pupils who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled pupil population.  A district may apply for additional State aid for nonconforming spaces that will permit pupils with disabilities to be educated to the greatest extent possible in the same buildings or classes with their nondisabled peers.  The nonconforming spaces may: (a) allow for the return of pupils with disabilities from private facilities; (b) permit the retention of pupils with disabilities who would otherwise be placed in private facilities; (c) provide space for regional programs in a host school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils; and (d) provide space for the coordination of regional programs by a county special services school district, educational services commission, jointure commission, or other agency authorized by law to provide regional educational services in a school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils.  A district's State support ratio shall be adjusted to equal the lesser of the sum of its district aid percentage as defined in section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) plus 0.25, or 100 percent for any nonconforming spaces approved by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph. h.   Upon approval of a school facilities project and determination of the preliminary eligible costs: (1)  In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall notify the district whether the school facilities project is approved and, if so approved, the preliminary eligible costs and the excess costs, if any. Following the determination of preliminary eligible costs and the notification of project approval, the district may appeal to the commissioner for an increase in those costs if the detailed plans and specifications completed by a design professional for the school facilities project indicate that the cost of constructing that portion of the project which is consistent with the facilities efficiency standards and does not exceed the area allowances per FTE student exceeds the preliminary eligible costs as determined by the commissioner for the project by 10 percent or more.  The district shall file its appeal within 30 days of the preparation of the plans and specifications.  If the district chooses not to file an appeal, then the final eligible costs shall equal the preliminary eligible costs. The appeal shall outline the reasons why the preliminary eligible costs calculated for the project are inadequate and estimate the amount of the adjustment which needs to be made to the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall forward the appeal information to the development authority for its review and recommendation.  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted as the final eligible costs.  If the development authority determines the additional costs are not within the control of the district or are the result of design factors required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner a final eligible cost based on its experience for districts with similar characteristics, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the commissioner shall not approve an adjustment to the preliminary eligible costs which exceeds 10 percent of the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall make a determination on the appeal within 30 days of its receipt. If the commissioner does not approve an adjustment to the school facilities project's preliminary eligible costs, the commissioner shall issue his findings in writing on the reasons for the denial and on why the preliminary eligible costs as originally calculated are sufficient. (2)  In the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall promptly prepare and submit to the development authority a preliminary project report which shall consist, at a minimum, of the following information:  a complete description of the school facilities project; the actual location of the project; the total square footage of the project together with a breakdown of total square footage by functional component; the preliminary eligible costs of the project; the project's priority ranking determined pursuant to subsection m. of this section; any other factors to be considered by the development authority in undertaking the project; and the name and address of the person from the district to contact in regard to the project. i.    Upon receipt by the development authority of the preliminary project report, the development authority, upon consultation with the district, shall prepare detailed plans and specifications and schedules which contain the development authority's estimated cost and schedule to complete the school facilities project.  The development authority shall transmit to the commissioner its recommendations in regard to the project which shall, at a minimum, contain the detailed plans and specifications; whether the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs; and any other factors which the development authority determines should be considered by the commissioner. (1)  In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs: the final eligible costs shall be deemed to equal the preliminary eligible costs; the commissioner shall be deemed to have given final approval to the project; and the preliminary project report shall be deemed to be the final project report delivered to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (2)  In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project cannot be completed within the preliminary eligible costs, prior to the submission of its recommendations to the commissioner, the development authority shall, in consultation with the district and the commissioner, determine whether changes can be made in the project which will result in a reduction in costs while at the same time meeting the facilities efficiency standards approved by the commissioner. (a)  If the development authority determines that changes in the school facilities project are possible so that the project can be accomplished within the scope of the preliminary eligible costs while still meeting the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall so advise the commissioner, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs; give final approval to the project with the changes noted; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (b)  If the development authority determines that it is not possible to make changes in the school facilities project so that it can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs either because the additional costs are the result of factors outside the control of the district or the additional costs are required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be increased accordingly, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the sum of the preliminary eligible costs plus the increase recommended by the development authority; give final approval to the project; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (c)  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards or approved pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection g. of this section, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs and specify the excess costs which are to be borne by the district; give final approval to the school facilities project; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section; provided that the commissioner may approve final eligible costs which are in excess of the preliminary eligible costs if, in his judgment, the action is necessary to meet the educational needs of the district. (d) For a school facilities project undertaken by the development authority, the development authority shall be responsible for any costs of construction, but only from the proceeds of bonds issued by the financing authority pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) and P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.), which exceed the amount originally projected by the development authority and approved for financing by the development authority, provided that the excess is the result of an underestimate of labor or materials costs by the development authority.  After receipt by the development authority of the final project report, the district shall be responsible only for the costs associated with changes, if any, made at the request of the district to the scope of the school facilities project. j.    The development authority shall not commence the construction of a school facilities project unless the commissioner transmits to the development authority a final project report and the district complies with the approval requirements for the local share, if any, pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-11).  The final project report shall contain all of the information contained in the preliminary project report and, in addition, shall contain: the final eligible costs; the excess costs, if any; the total costs which equals the final eligible costs plus excess costs, if any; the State share; and the local share. k.   For the SDA districts, the State share shall be 100 percent of the final eligible costs.  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9) , for all other districts, the State share shall be an amount equal to the district aid percentage; except that the State share shall not be less than 40 percent of the final eligible costs. If any district which is included in district factor group A or B, other than an SDA district, is having difficulty financing the local share of a school facilities project, the district may apply to the commissioner to receive 100 percent State support for the project and the commissioner may request the approval of the Legislature to increase the State share of the project to 100 percent. l.    The local share for school facilities projects constructed by the authority or a redevelopment entity shall equal the final eligible costs plus any excess costs less the State share. m.  (1) Within 90 days of the effective date of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.), the commissioner shall develop an educational facilities needs assessment for each SDA district.  The assessment shall be updated periodically by the commissioner in accordance with the schedule the commissioner deems appropriate for the district; except that each assessment shall at a minimum be updated within five years of the development of the district's most recent prior educational facilities needs assessment.  The assessment shall be transmitted to the development authority to be used to initiate the planning activities required prior to the establishment of the educational priority ranking of school facilities projects pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  Following the approval of an SDA district's long-range facilities plan or of an amendment to that plan, but prior to authorization of preconstruction activities for a school facilities project included in the plan or amendment, the commissioner shall establish, in consultation with the SDA district, an educational priority ranking of all school facilities projects in the SDA district based upon the commissioner's determination of critical need in accordance with priority project categories developed by the commissioner.  The priority project categories shall include, but not be limited to, health and safety, overcrowding in the early childhood, elementary, middle, and high school grade levels, spaces necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled students who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled student population, rehabilitation, and educational adequacy. (3)  (a) Upon the commissioner's determination of the educational priority ranking of school facilities projects in SDA districts pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, the SDA districts, and the governing bodies of the municipalities in which the SDA districts are situate, shall establish a Statewide strategic plan to be used in the sequencing of SDA district school facilities projects based upon the projects' educational priority rankings and issues which impact the development authority's ability to complete the projects including, but not limited to, the construction schedule and other appropriate factors.  The development authority shall revise the Statewide strategic plan and the sequencing of SDA district school facilities projects in accordance with that plan no less than once every five years, except that the plan shall be updated within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). In addition to any other information that the development authority may deem appropriate, the Statewide strategic plan shall include a description of the project, which shall indicate whether the project will be new construction or renovation and whether the project will require the acquisition of land. (b)  In developing the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall prioritize: (i) new construction projects; (ii) projects located on land owned by the school district or other public entities; and (iii) projects needed to replace school buildings that have been in use for 100 or more years. (c) Any amendment to an SDA district's long-range facilities plan that is submitted to the commissioner in the period between the five-year updates of the long-range facilities plan shall be considered by the development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, for incorporation into the Statewide strategic plan.  In making a determination on whether or not to amend the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall consider the cost of the amendment, the impact of the amendment upon the school development plans for other districts, and other appropriate factors. (d) Within 10 days following any update to the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall transmit the plan to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), and to the members of the Senate Education Committee and the Assembly Education Committee, or any successor committees. (4)  In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall establish a priority process for the financing of school facilities projects based upon the commissioner's determination of critical need in accordance with priority project categories developed by the commissioner.  The priority project categories shall include, but not be limited to, health and safety, overcrowding in the elementary, middle, and high school grade levels, spaces necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled students who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled student population, and full-day kindergarten facilities in the case of school districts required to provide full-day preschool pursuant to section 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54). n.   The provisions of the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., shall be applicable to any school facilities project constructed by a district but shall not be applicable to projects constructed by the development authority or a redevelopment entity pursuant to the provisions of this act. o.   In the case of a school facilities project of a district other than an SDA district, any proceeds of school bonds issued by the district for the purpose of funding the project which remain unspent upon completion of the project shall be used by the district to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the school bonds. p.   Upon completion by the development authority of a school facilities project, if the cost of construction and completion of the project is less than the total costs, the district shall be entitled to receive a portion of the local share based on a pro rata share of the difference based on the ratio of the State share to the local share. q.   The development authority shall determine the cause of any costs of construction which exceed the amount originally projected by the development authority and approved for financing by the financing authority. r.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.137). s.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.137). (cf: P.L.2009, c.185, s.1) 5.  (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) or any other section of law to the contrary, the board of education of a district other than an SDA district may enter into an agreement with a county improvement authority to construct a school facilities project and to issue its bonds to finance the local share of a project that is to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (18A:7G-15), or to finance the total costs of a project that is not to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15).  The bonds of a county improvement authority issued to finance the total costs of a school facilities project that is not to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15) shall be eligible for State debt service aid in accordance with the formula established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9). b.    A district other than an SDA district may lease its lands or facilities to the county improvement authority, which may construct the school facilities project.  Whenever a school facilities project is constructed by a county improvement authority pursuant to the provisions of this section, the improvement authority shall follow the applicable public bidding procedures or requirements under the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60), or sections 34 through 41 of P.L.2021, c.71 (C.18A:18A-61 through C.18A:18A-68). c.     The county improvement authority shall lease the school facilities project to the county, which shall then lease it for nominal consideration to the district for as long as the county improvement authority bonds or refunding bonds are outstanding.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a county to require the district to bear any portion of the cost of the debt service on the county improvement authority bonds issued to fund the school facilities project or any refunding bonds. d.    The county lease payments made to the county improvement authority pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall not be subject to any cap on appropriations or on spending or to any tax levy cap.  The county lease payments shall be sufficient to pay debt service on the county improvement authority bonds issued to fund the school facilities project, or any refunding bonds, that remains after the application of any State debt service aid paid on those bonds pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9).  The county lease payments shall be payable over the life of the bonds. e.     When the bonds issued by a county improvement authority are no longer outstanding, the leases and liens of the county and the county improvement authority shall expire and the school facilities project shall be solely vested in the school district.  The school district shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of the school facility upon the completion of the school facilities project. 6.  Section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9) is amended to read as follows: 9.   a. State debt service aid for capital investment in school facilities for a district other than an SDA district which elects not to finance the project under section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15), shall be distributed upon a determination of preliminary eligible costs by the commissioner, according to the following formula: Aid is the sum of A for each issuance of school bonds issued for a school facilities project approved by the commissioner after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) where A = B x AC/P x   DAP x M, with AC/P =1 whenever AC/P would otherwise yield a number greater than one, and where: B is the district's debt service for the individual issuance for the fiscal year; AC is the preliminary eligible costs determined pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7); P is the principal of the individual issuance plus any other funding sources approved for the school facilities project; DAP is the district's district aid percentage as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) and where DAP shall not be less than 40 percent. If the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment, the DAP shall be increased by no more than five percent. In order to qualify for a DAP increase for the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment pursuant to this subsection, a district shall submit to the development authority and Department of Education a certification, along with evidential documentation, attesting that the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment; and M is a factor representing the degree to which a district has fulfilled maintenance requirements for a school facilities project determined pursuant to subsection b. of this section. For county special services school districts, DAP shall be that of the county vocational school district in the same county. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection to the contrary, DAP for a county vocational school district school facilities project that is approved by the commissioner following the effective date of P.L.2009, c.185 shall equal the greater of the district's district aid percentage as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) or the percentage of the students in the county vocational school district's resident enrollment who reside in SDA districts; except that DAP shall not be less than 40 percent or greater than 90 percent. b.   The maintenance factor (M) shall be 1.0 except when one of the following conditions applies, in which case the maintenance factor shall be as specified: (1)  Effective ten years from the date of the enactment of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), the maintenance factor for aid for reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, modernization, renovation or repair, or for an addition to a school facility, shall be zero for all school facilities projects for which the district fails to demonstrate over the ten years preceding issuance a net investment in maintenance of the related school facility of at least two percent of the replacement cost of the school facility, determined pursuant to subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7) using the area cost allowance of the year ten years preceding the year in which the school bonds are issued. (2)  For new construction, additions, and school facilities aided under subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7) supported by financing issued for projects approved by the commissioner after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), beginning in the fourth year after occupancy of the school facility, the maintenance factor shall be reduced according to the following schedule for all school facilities projects for which the district fails to demonstrate in the prior fiscal year an investment in maintenance of the related school facility of at least two-tenths of one percent of the replacement cost of the school facility, determined pursuant to subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7).

(3)  The development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, shall develop and implement training programs, seminars, or symposia to provide technical assistance to SDA districts deemed to lack the capacity to manage a school facility project or projects; except that nothing herein shall be construed to require the development authority or the commissioner to authorize an SDA district to hire additional staff in order to achieve capacity. (4)  If the development authority determines to delegate a school facilities project to an SDA district in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, the development authority, the commissioner, and the district shall enter into a grant agreement. The grant agreement shall, at a minimum, establish a timeline for the completion of the school facilities project, which timeline shall be established based on the scope of the work to be performed. (5) If the development authority determines to delegate a school facilities project to an SDA district in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, the SDA district shall be deemed to be in noncompliance with the grant agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection if the district enters into a contract with a contractor, subcontractor, or consultant which is debarred, suspended, or disqualified from State, development authority, or federal government contracting at the time of the contract award1 or with a firm which has not been prequalified by the development authority. If the district enters into a contract with a debarred, suspended, or disqualified contractor, subcontractor, or consultant, then the grant agreement shall be rendered null and void.

The remaining funds for school facilities projects shall be disbursed to the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grants Fund. (cf: P.L.2008, c.39, s.4) 10. Section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15) is amended to read as follows: 15. a. In the case of a district other than an SDA district, for any project approved by the commissioner after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), the district may elect to receive a one-time grant for the State share of the project in accordance with the provisions of subsection b. of this section rather than annual debt service aid under section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9).  The State share payable to the district shall equal the product of the project's final eligible costs and the district aid percentage or 40 percent, whichever is greater. If the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment, the district aid percentage shall be increased by no more than five percent.  In order to qualify for a district aid percentage increase for the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment pursuant to this subsection, a district shall submit to the development authority and Department of Education a certification, along with evidential documentation, attesting that the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment. b.   The commissioner shall establish a process for the annual allocation of grant funding.  Under that process, the commissioner shall annually notify districts of the date on which the commissioner shall begin to receive applications for grant funding.  A district shall have 90 days from that date to submit an application to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall make a decision on a district's application within 90 days of the submission of all such applications and shall allocate the grant funding in accordance with the priority process established pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection m. of section 5 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-5). c.   The development authority shall provide grant funding for the State's share of the final eligible costs of a school facilities project pursuant to an agreement between the district and the development authority which shall, in addition to other terms and conditions, set forth the terms of disbursement of the State share.  The funding of the State share shall not commence until the district secures financing for the local share. (cf: P.L.2008, c.39, s.5) 11. Section 23 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-23) is amended to read as follows: 23.  a.  Not less than the prevailing wage rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) shall be paid to workers employed in the performance of construction contracts in connection with any school facilities project that is undertaken by the development authority, a redevelopment entity, a district, a charter school or renaissance school project, a county improvement authority, or a private entity, when the private entity is undertaking construction on a school facilities project under a public-private partnership, and any contractor who violates the provisions of this subsection shall be prohibited from subsequently bidding on any State or district contract. b.    Registration fees collected pursuant to P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.) shall be applied toward the enforcement and administrative costs of the Division of Workplace Standards, Office of Wage and Hour Compliance, Public Contracts section and Registration section within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. (cf: P.L.2007, c.137, s.34) 12.  (New section)  There is hereby created within the development authority an Office of Contracting Accountability. The office shall, in consultation with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, ensure the compliance in the payment of no less than the prevailing wage rate determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.), as well as with all other applicable State wage and hour laws and regulations, by contractors selected for a school facilities project undertaken by the development authority or by an SDA district that has been delegated management of the project by the development authority. The office shall collect and review all certified payrolls for work on school facilities projects undertaken by the development authority or by an SDA district that has been delegated management of the project by the development authority, and shall conduct at least one worksite inspection per project on a quarterly basis.

(New section)  a.  The development authority and an SDA district to which the development authority has delegated management of a school facilities project, as well as any contractor or consultant retained thereby, shall not enter into a contract for work with any person or firm that is currently debarred, suspended, or disqualified from State, development authority, or federal government contracting. b.   The development authority and any SDA district to which the development authority has delegated management of a school facilities project shall insert in all contracts with all contracted parties, and all contractors and consultants shall insert into all of their contracts with all subcontractors and subconsultants, a clause stating that the contracted party, its subcontractors or subconsultants may be debarred, suspended or disqualified from contracting or working, or both, on the approved school facilities project if the contracted party commits any of the acts listed in N.J.A.C.17:19-4.1 or any other applicable regulation issued by the development authority. c.     The development authority or the SDA district to which the development authority has delegated management of a school facilities project shall include in its bid specification for any work or services on an approved school facilities project that all bidders submit a sworn statement by the bidder, or an officer or partner of the bidder, indicating whether the bidder is, at the time of the bid, included on the State Treasurers, the development authoritys or the federal governments list of debarred, suspended or disqualified bidders as a result of action taken by any state or federal agency, as the case may be. Bid specifications for the approved school facilities project shall state that the district shall immediately notify the development authority in writing whenever it appears that a bidder is on the State Treasurers, the development authoritys, or the federal governments list.

(New section) a. There is hereby created within the development authority an Emergent Condition Remediation Program to provide for the financing of emergent projects in the public schools of SDA districts, which public schools shall not include charter schools or renaissance school projects physically located in the SDA districts. Emergent projects financed under the program shall be funded by moneys from the SDA District Emergent Project Fund established pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection i. of section 14 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-14). b. Under the Emergent Condition Remediation Program established pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the development authority shall create a process whereby contractors prequalified by the development authority to bid on school facilities projects apply to be a part of a pool of contractors available to address emergent conditions in SDA districts under a standing retainer agreement subject to the development authoritys project labor agreement for emergent projects in accordance with the provisions of P.L.2002, c.44 (C.52:38-1 et seq.). The prequalified contractors that are part of the pool of contractors established pursuant to this subsection shall be available for any emergent project in any SDA district. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring the retainer of prequalified contractors for specific emergent projects. c.     As used in this section, emergent project means a school facilities project or other capital project eligible for State funding that would alleviate a condition that, if not corrected on an expedited basis, would render a building or facility so potentially injurious or hazardous that it causes an imminent peril to the health and safety of students or staff. 21.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, an SDA district to which the development authority has delegated management of a school facilities project shall not enter into a cooperative pricing system or agreement for construction services on school facilities projects. 22.  N.J.S.18A:18A-4 is amended to read as follows: 18A:18A-4.  a.  Every contract for the provision or performance of any goods or services, the cost of which in the aggregate exceeds the bid threshold, shall be awarded only by resolution of the board of education to the lowest responsible bidder after public advertising for bids and bidding therefor, except as is provided otherwise in this chapter or specifically by any other law. The board of education may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board of education and subject to subsections b. and c. of this section, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder, if the board of education finds that: (1)  any board of education has had prior negative experience with the bidder  within the past 10 years, as reported in a contractor evaluation submitted pursuant to N.J.S. 18A:18A-15; or (2)  in the case of a contract for a school facilities project as defined in section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), there has been at least one instance of prior negative experience with the bidder by any board of education, or by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, or any combination thereof, as reported in a contractor evaluation submitted pursuant to N.J.S.18A:18A-15, a school facilities project performance evaluation, or in a mandatory uniform performance evaluation conducted pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-36), as appropriate. b.    As used in this section, "prior negative experience" means any of the following: (1)   the bidder has been found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have: failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a prior contract with a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (2)   the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, to utilize the services of another contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or complete the contract; (3)   the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, to look to the bidder's surety for completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; (4)   the bidder is debarred or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award, whether or not the action was based on experience with a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (5)  the bidders prequalification to bid on a school facilities project, which prequalification was granted pursuant to the process established by the development authority under section 59 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-33), has been revoked by the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (6)  the bidder has been suspended from contracting or engaging in work or services on a school facilities project; or (7)  the bidders prequalification to submit bids on a school facilities project has been revoked pursuant to subsection b. of section 61 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-35) or subsection b. of section 62 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-36). c.     The following conditions apply if the board of education is contemplating a disqualification based on prior negative experience: (1)   The existence of any of the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not require that a bidder be disqualified.  In each instance, the decision to disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the board of education and shall be rendered in the best interests of the board of education. (2)   All mitigating factors shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted. (3)   The bidder shall be furnished by the board of education with a written notice (a) stating that a disqualification is being considered; (b) setting forth the reason for the disqualification; and (c) indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing before the board of education if the bidder so requests within a stated period of time.  At the hearing, the bidder shall show good cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and testimony.  If the board of education determines that good cause has not been shown by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and, thus, disqualified. (4)   Disqualification shall be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years. (5)   A disqualification, other than a disqualification pursuant to which a board of education is prohibited by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period thereof may be reduced, in the discretion of the board of education, upon the submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, such as reversal of a judgment, or actual change of ownership, management or control of the bidder. (6)   An opportunity for a hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey.  The term of such a disqualification shall be concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or department. d.    The purchase of text books and materials that exceed the bid threshold and are approved by a board of education pursuant to N.J.S.18A:34-1 shall not require the further adoption of a resolution for purchase. (cf: P.L.2002, c.90, s.1) 23.  (New section)  a.  Within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, shall, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), promulgate regulations for school districts concerning the incorporation of construction contract provisions that encourage the completion of construction projects on schedule. b.    At a minimum, the regulations shall include sample provisions that school districts may include in future issuances of construction contracts.  In addition to any other considerations that the commissioner may deem appropriate, the regulations shall prescribe: (1)   industry-leading penalties for the late delivery of projects by contractors; and (2)   incentives for contractors who deliver projects on time and under budget. 24.  Section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  As used in this section: "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-4).

The long-range maintenance plan shall be approved by the State Treasurer pursuant to regulations promulgated by the State Treasurer that reflect national building maintenance standards and other appropriate building maintenance benchmarks. (4)   The State Treasurer, in consultation with the authority, the Commissioner of the Department of Education, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Schools Development Authority, shall review all completed applications, and request additional information as is needed to make a complete assessment of the project. No public-private partnership agreement shall be executed until approval has been granted by the State Treasurer. Prior to a final decision by the State Treasurer on the application, the authority, the Department of Education, and the Schools Development Authority shall be afforded the opportunity to provide comments on the application that they deem appropriate, and the State Treasurer shall consider any comments submitted by the authority, the Department of Education, and the Schools Development Authority with respect to the application. The State Treasurer will find that: (i) the school district's assumptions regarding the project's scope, its benefits, its risks and the cost of the public sector option were fully and reasonably developed (ii) the design of the project is feasible; (iii) the experience and qualifications of the private entity; (iv) the financial plan is sound; (v) the long-range maintenance plan is adequate to protect the investment; (vi) the project is in the best interest of the public, using the criteria in paragraph (6) of subsection e. of this section; (vii) a resolution by the school district's governing body of its intent to enter into a public-private partnership agreement for the project has been received; and (viii) the term sheet for any proposed procurement contains all necessary elements.

(1) A private entity seeking to enter into a public-private partnership agreement with the school district shall be qualified by the school district as part of the procurement process, provided such process ensures that the private entity and its subcontractors and consultants, where relevant, meet at least the minimum qualifications standards promulgated by the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Department of Education, Schools Development Authority, and such other school district standards for qualification for professional services, construction contracting, and other qualifications applicable to the project, prior to submitting a proposal under the procurement process. (2)   A request for qualifications for a public-private partnership agreement shall be advertised at least 45 days prior to the anticipated date of receipt.  The advertisement of the request for qualifications shall be published on the official Internet website of the school district and at least one or more newspapers with Statewide circulation.

The evaluation criteria shall be, at minimum, criteria promulgated by the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Department of Education, and Schools Development Authority. (4)   The school district may accept unsolicited proposals from private entities for public-private partnership agreements. If the school district receives an unsolicited proposal and determines that it meets the standards of this section, the school district shall publish a notice of the receipt of the proposal on the Internet site of the school district and through advertisement in at least one or more newspapers with Statewide circulation. The school district shall also provide notice of the proposal at its next scheduled public meeting and to the State Treasurer.

A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each municipal and county local government body in the geographic area affected by the proposal. (5)   After the proposal or proposals have been received, and any public notification period has expired, the school district shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the school district shall rely upon, at minimum, the evaluation criteria promulgated by the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Department of Education, and Schools Development Authority.  In addition, the local school district may consider factors that include, but may not be limited to, professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering, architectural services, or cost-reduction terms, finance plans, and the need for school district funds to deliver the project and discharge the agreement. The private entity selected shall comply with all laws and regulations required by the State government entity, including but not limited to section 1 of P.L.2001, c.134 (C.52:32-44), sections 2 through 8 of P.L.1975, c.127 (C.10:5-32 to 38), section 1 of P.L.1977, c.33 (C.52:25-24.2), P.L.2005, c.51 (C.19:44A-20.13 et al.); P.L.2005, c.271 (C.40A:11-51 et al.), Executive Order No. 117 of 2008, Executive Order No. 118 of 2008, Executive Order No. 189, prior to executing the public private partnership agreement.

(6)   The school district may require, upon receipt of one or more proposals, that the private entity assume responsibility for all costs incurred by the school district before execution of the public-private partnership agreement, including costs of retaining independent experts to review, analyze, and advise the school district with respect to the proposal. (7)   The school district shall set aside one percent of each project and remit it the Public-Private Partnership Review fund established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.52:18A-260), for purposes of plan review and analysis required under the bill. (8)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as or deemed a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the State, the local government unit or an affected locality or public entity or any officer or employee thereof with respect to the participation in or approval of all or any part of the public-private project. (cf: P.L.2018, c.90, s.2) 25.  N.J.S.18A:21-4 is amended to read as follows: 18A:21-4.  A board of education may in any school year draw against its capital reserve account, up to the amount of the balance therein, to the extent that the withdrawal is anticipated as a revenue in the school budget for the then current school year or approved by the commissioner for good cause; provided, that no money drawn from the account may be used for current expenses of the general fund or debt service payments but shall be used exclusively for capital expenses of the general fund or capital projects fund when expressly authorized as part of a referendum, except as provided for in section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60). (cf: P.L.1996, c.138, s.52) 26. Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows: 12. The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided. When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). Delivery by the municipal clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by the clerk that the exemption has been terminated. Within 10 calendar days following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational purposes. Whenever an exemption status changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper. a.   The financial agreement shall specify the duration of the exemption for urban renewal entities in accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1)  the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or (2)  for each project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection, "redevelopment agreement" means an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. A financial agreement may provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection. b.   During the term of any exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings and improvements of the project and, to the extent authorized pursuant to this section, on the land, the urban renewal entity shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (1)  An annual amount equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the annual gross revenue from each unit of the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project, if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross revenue shall not be more than 15% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, nor less than 10% in the case of all other projects. At the option of the municipality, or where because of the nature of the development, ownership, use or occupancy of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is to be undertaken in units, the total annual gross rental or gross shelter rent or annual gross revenue cannot be reasonably ascertained, the governing body shall provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The percentage of the total project cost or total project unit cost shall not be more than 2% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, and shall not be less than 2% in the case of all other projects. (2)  In either case, the financial agreement shall establish a schedule of annual service charges to be paid over the term of the exemption period, which shall be in stages as follows: (a)  For the first stage of the exemption period, which shall commence with the date of completion of the unit or of the project, as the case may be, and continue for a time of not less than six years nor more than 15 years, as specified in the financial agreement, the urban renewal entity shall pay the municipality an annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project in an annual amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11).  For the remainder of the period of the exemption, if any, the annual service charge shall be determined as follows: (b)  For the second stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 20% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (c)  For the third stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 40% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (d) For the fourth stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 60% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; and (e)  For the final stage of the exemption period, the duration of which shall not be less than one year and shall be specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 80% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater. If the financial agreement provides for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project,  less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement, the financial agreement shall set forth a schedule of annual service charges for the exemption period which shall be based upon the minimum service charges and staged adjustments set forth in this section. The annual service charge shall be paid to the municipality on a quarterly basis in a manner consistent with the municipality's tax collection schedule. Each municipality which enters into a financial agreement on or after the effective date of P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) shall remit five percent of the annual service charge collected by the municipality to the county in accordance with the provisions of R.S.54:4-74. If the municipality enters into a contract with a board of education pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the municipality shall also remit to the board of education such amounts as may be required under the contract. Against the annual service charge the urban renewal entity shall be entitled to credit for the amount, without interest, of the real estate taxes on land paid by it in the last four preceding quarterly installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of the financial agreement, the minimum annual service charge shall be the amount of the total taxes levied against all real property in the area covered by the project in the last full tax year in which the area was subject to taxation, and the minimum annual service charge shall be paid in each year in which the annual service charge calculated pursuant to this section or the financial agreement would be less than the minimum annual service charge. c.   All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall terminate at the time prescribed in the financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), the project, all affected parcels, land and all improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as are other taxable properties in the municipality.  After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end upon the entity's rendering its final accounting to and with the municipality. (cf: P.L.2018, c.97, s.17) 27. Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-237) is amended to read as follows: 3. a.  There is established in, but not of, the Department of the Treasury a public body corporate and politic, with corporate succession, to be known as the "New Jersey Schools Development Authority." The development authority shall constitute an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the development authority of the powers conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the State. b.   The development authority shall consist of the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, the executive director of the Economic Development Authority, and the State Treasurer, who shall serve as ex officio members; and 12 public members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.  At least one of the public members shall have knowledge or expertise in the area of law enforcement and the remaining public members shall have knowledge or expertise in real estate development, construction management, finance, architectural or building design, education, or any other related field. In addition, the development authority shall consist of two public members, one appointed by the Senate President and one appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, which members shall have knowledge or expertise in real estate development, construction management, finance, architectural or building design, education, or any other related field. c.   Each public member shall serve for a term of five years and shall hold office for the term of the member's appointment and until the member's successor shall have been appointed and qualified.  A member shall be eligible for reappointment.  Any vacancy in the membership occurring other than by expiration of term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment but for the unexpired term only. In the case of the first 11 public members appointed by the Governor pursuant to subsection b. of this section, three shall serve for a term of two years, three shall serve for a term of three years, three shall serve for a term of four years, and two shall serve for a term of five years. d.   (1) Each member appointed by the Governor may be removed from office by the Governor, for cause, after a public hearing, and may be suspended by the Governor pending the completion of such hearing. Each member before entering upon the members duties shall take and subscribe an oath to perform the duties of the office faithfully, impartially and justly to the best of the members ability.  A record of such oath shall be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State.

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, no officer or employee of the State shall be deemed to have forfeited or shall forfeit any office or employment or any benefits or emoluments thereof by reason of the acceptance of the office of ex officio member of the development authority or any services therein. h.   Each ex officio member of the development authority may designate an officer or employee of the member's department to represent the member at meetings of the development authority, and each such designee may lawfully vote and otherwise act on behalf of the member for whom the person constitutes the designee. Any such designation shall be in writing delivered to the development authority and shall continue in effect until revoked or amended by writing delivered to the development authority. i.    The development authority shall appoint from among its members an audit committee and such other committees as it deems necessary or conducive to the efficient management and operation of the development authority. j.    The development authority may be dissolved by act of the Legislature on condition that the development authority has no debts or obligations outstanding or that provision has been made for the payment or retirement of such debts or obligations.  Upon any such dissolution of the development authority, all property, funds and assets thereof shall be vested in the State. k.   A true copy of the minutes of every meeting of the development authority shall be forthwith delivered by and under the certification of the secretary thereof to the Governor.  No action taken at the meeting by the development authority shall have force or effect until 10 days, Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays excepted, after the copy of the minutes shall have been so delivered, unless during such 10-day period the Governor shall approve the same in which case the action shall become effective upon such approval.

This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides various changes to the laws governing the construction of school facilities projects and the operations of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority (SDA). Model School Designs The bill requires the SDA, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, to establish a model school design program that would establish uniform standards for the exterior and interior design of school facilities projects. The bill defines the components of the model school design program. The bill requires all projects in SDA districts to conform to the standards of the model school design program. Non-SDA Projects The bill also provides several changes to the laws governing the construction of school facilities projects in non-SDA school districts. The bill allows a school district to raise bonds for a school facilities project without the approval of the voters of the district if the school district enters into a contract with one or more municipalities, wherein the municipality provides the district with not less than 60 percent of the payments in lieu of taxes received from one or more designated properties, and the district pledges those monies to the repayment of the bonds.  However, after entering into the contract, the school district would also be required to submit an application to the commissioner before issuing the bonds without voter approval. Additionally, the bill permits the board of education of a district other than an SDA district to enter into an agreement with a county improvement authority to construct a school facilities project and to issue bonds to finance certain portions of the project. The bill also permits a board of education of a school district to draw against its capital reserve account in order to finance a portion of a project for which a school district and private entity enter into a public-private partnership agreement pursuant to current law. The bill also requires the commissioner, in consultation with the SDA, to promulgate regulations concerning the incorporation of construction contract provisions that encourage the completion of construction projects on schedule. SDA Finances and Operations The bill provides that bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) for the State share of school facilities projects, the proceeds of which are transferred to the SDA, will not support the costs of either agency related to the issuance of the bonds. Bonds issued after the effective date of the committee substitute will not support the administrative, non-project insurance, operating and other expenses of the EDA to issue the bonds. Under the committee substitute, the costs related to the undertaking of the planning, design, and construction of school facilities projects will also not be supported by bonds issued after the substitutes effective date. These administrative costs would instead be annually supported by State appropriations. The bill also requires the SDA to establish three funds in which the net proceeds of the bonds issued for school facilities projects, and any State appropriations for school facilities projects, would be deposited. The three funds are as follows: (1) the SDA District Project Fund; (2) the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grants Fund; and (3) the SDA District Emergent Project Fund. The bill stipulates that no less than 70 percent of any appropriations providing direct funding for school facilities projects would be appropriated for SDA district school facilities projects and SDA district emergent needs. The remaining funds would be disbursed to the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grant Fund. School Facilities Projects of Charter Schools and Renaissance School Projects in SDA Districts and the Charter School and Renaissance School Project Facilities Loan Program. The bill establishes the Charter School and Renaissance School Project Facilities Loan Program, which would provide eligible borrowers with a loan, including but not limited to subordinate loans, to undertake or facilitate school facilities projects for non-profit charter schools and non-profit renaissance school projects located in an SDA district.

CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the construction of school facilities projects, supplementing P.L.2000, c.72 (18A:7G-1 et al.), chapter 18A of Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, P.L.1995, c.426 (C.18A:36A-1 et seq.,), P.L.2011, c.176 (C.18A:36C-1 et seq.), and P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-1 et seq.), and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 2 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The Constitution of the State of New Jersey requires the Legislature to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools and this legislative responsibility includes ensuring that students are educated in physical facilities that are safe, healthy, and conducive to learning. b.    Inadequacies in the quality, utility, and safety of educational facilities have arisen among local school districts of this State.  In order to ensure that the Legislature's constitutional responsibility for adequate educational facilities is met, there is a need to establish an efficiency standard for educational facilities at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels which will assure that the core curriculum content standards are taught to all of the children of the State in a setting which facilitates and promotes that learning. c.     Educational infrastructure inadequacies are greatest in the SDA districts where maintenance has been deferred and new construction has not been initiated due to concerns about cost.  To remedy the facilities inadequacies of the SDA districts, the State must promptly engage in a facilities needs assessment and fund the entire cost of repairing, renovating, and constructing the new school facilities determined by the Commissioner of Education to be required to meet the school facilities efficiency standards in the SDA districts.  In other districts, the State must also identify need in view of anticipated growth in school population, and must contribute to the cost of the renovation and construction of new facilities to ensure the provision of a thorough and efficient education in those districts. d.    While providing that the educational infrastructure meets the requirements of a thorough and efficient education, the State must also protect the interests of taxpayers who will bear the burden of this obligation.  Design of school facilities should incorporate maximum operating efficiencies and new technologies to advance the energy efficiency of school facilities and the efficiency of other school building systems, construction should be achieved in as efficient a manner as possible while also ensuring that public funds spent on the construction of school facilities support a skilled workforce compensated at dignified wages, and a mechanism to assure proper maintenance of new facilities should be established and implemented, in order to reduce the overall cost of the program and to preserve this infrastructure investment. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.38) 2.   Section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.   As used in sections 1 through 30 and 57 through 71 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), sections 14 through 17 of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.18A:7G-45 through C.18A:7G-48), and sections 5, 7, 12, 15, and19 through 21 of P.L.  , c.

Within a reasonable period of time after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), the commissioner shall publish the facilities efficiency standards developed for the 2000-2001, 2001-2002, and 2002-2003 school years in the New Jersey Register.  Within a reasonable period of time after 30 days after publication in the New Jersey Register, the commissioner shall file the facilities efficiency standards with the Office of Administrative Law and those standards shall become effective immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law.  During the 30-day period the commissioner shall provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposed facilities efficiency standards. (2)  Within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, shall promulgate a model school design program that shall establish uniform standards for the exterior and interior design of school facilities projects.  The development authority may revise the model school design program as the development authority deems necessary to incorporate advances or improvements in materials, technology, construction methods, or educational standards. i.    Within 90 days of the commissioner's receipt of a long-range facilities plan for review, the commissioner shall determine whether the plan is fully and accurately completed and whether all information necessary for a decision on the plan has been filed by the district.  If the commissioner determines that the plan is complete, the commissioner shall promptly notify the district in writing and shall have 60 days from the date of that notification to determine whether to approve the plan or not.  If the commissioner determines that the plan is not complete, the commissioner shall notify the district in writing. The district shall provide to the commissioner whatever information the commissioner determines is necessary to make the plan accurate and complete. The district shall submit that information to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall have 60 days from the date of receipt of accurate and complete information to determine whether to approve the plan or not. j.    Notwithstanding any provision in subsection i. of this section, if at any time the number of long-range facilities plans filed by school districts with the commissioner and pending review exceeds 20 percent of the number of school districts in New Jersey, the commissioner may extend by 60 days the deadline for reviewing each plan pending at that time. k.   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.260). l.    By July 1, 2001, the commissioner shall provide the Legislature with recommendations to address the circumstances of districts which are contiguous with two or more Abbott districts.  The recommendations shall address the issues of the financing of school facilities projects and the funding of the educational and other programs required within these districts as a result of their unique demographic situation. m.  By July 1, 2001, the commissioner shall study the Safe Schools Design Guidelines, prepared by the Florida Center for Community Design and Research, which address the issues of school safety and security through the design of school facilities.  Based upon the commissioner's study, the commissioner shall issue recommendations to districts on the appropriateness of including the Safe Schools Design Guidelines in the design and construction of school facilities projects. (cf: P.L.2007, c.260, s.40) 4.   Section 5 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-5) is amended to read as follows: 5.   a. The development authority shall undertake and the financing authority shall finance the school facilities projects of SDA districts. b.   In the case of a district other than an SDA district, State support for the project shall be determined pursuant to section 9 or section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9 or C.18A:7G-15), as applicable. c.   Notwithstanding any provision of N.J.S.18A:18A-16 to the contrary, the procedures for obtaining approval of a school facilities project shall be as set forth in P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.); provided that any district whose school facilities project is not constructed by the development authority shall also be required to comply with the provisions of N.J.S.18A:18A-16 and, in the case of a school facilities project that has estimated total costs over $10,000,000, shall be overseen by a non-conflicted construction management service provider, which holds a current, valid classification issued by the Division of Property Management and Construction in the Department of Treasury pursuant to its classification processes for construction managers, who shall serve from initial application to the commissioner for approval of the project through project completion. d.   (1) Any district seeking to initiate a school facilities project shall apply to the commissioner for approval of the project.  The application may include, but not be limited to: a description of the school facilities project; a schematic drawing of the project or, at the option of the district, preliminary plans and specifications; a delineation and description of each of the functional components of the project; educational specifications detailing the programmatic needs of each proposed space; the number of unhoused students to be housed in the project; the area allowances per FTE student as calculated pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-8); and the estimated cost to complete the project as determined by the district. (2)  (a) In the case of an SDA district school facilities project, based upon its educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan established pursuant to subsection m. of this section, the commissioner may authorize the development authority to undertake preconstruction activities which may include, but need not be limited to, site identification, investigation, and acquisition, feasibility studies, land-related design work, design work, site remediation, demolition, and acquisition of temporary facilities. Upon receipt of the authorization, the development authority may initiate the preconstruction activities required to prepare the application for commissioner approval of the school facilities project. Site remediation and demolition preconstruction activities undertaken by the development authority pursuant to this subparagraph shall be included as part of the project charter of the SDA district school facilities project, which project charter covers all other construction activities of the school facilities project. (b) In the case of an SDA district school facilities project, the project design shall conform to the standards of the model school design program developed by the development authority pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection h. of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4). The development authority may permit an SDA district school facilities project to include design features that are considered excess costs provided that the design features do not exceed the lesser of 10 percent of total estimated project costs or $2,000,000. (c) In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the project design of a school facilities project may conform to the standards of the model school design program developed by the development authority pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection h. of section 4 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-4). e.   The commissioner shall review each proposed school facilities project to determine whether it is consistent with the district's long-range facilities plan and whether it complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards; and in the case of an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan developed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection m. of this section and whether the project conforms to the standards of the model school design program; and in the case of a district other than an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's priority pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection m. of this section.  The commissioner shall make a decision on a district's application within 90 days from the date the commissioner determines that the application is fully and accurately completed and that all information necessary for a decision has been filed by the district, or from the date of the last revision made by the district. If the commissioner is not able to make a decision within 90 days, the commissioner shall notify the district in writing explaining the reason for the delay and indicating the date on which a decision on the project will be made, provided that the date shall not be later than 60 days from the expiration of the original 90 days set forth in this subsection. If the decision is not made by the subsequent date indicated by the commissioner, then the project shall be deemed approved and the preliminary eligible costs for new construction shall be calculated by using the proposed square footage of the building as the approved area for unhoused students. f.    If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the district's long-range facilities plan and does not exceed the area allowance per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs of the project pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7); except that (1) in the case of a county special services school district or a county vocational school district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the amount determined by the board of school estimate and approved by the board of chosen freeholders pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1971, c.271 (C.18A:46-42) or N.J.S.18A:54-31 as appropriate, and (2) in the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the estimated cost as determined by the development authority. g.   If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project is inconsistent with the facilities efficiency standards or exceeds the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall notify the district. (1)  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates that school facilities needs related to required programs cannot be addressed within the facilities efficiency standards and that all other proposed spaces are consistent with those standards.  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the additional area allowances are necessary to accommodate centralized facilities to be shared among two or more school buildings within the district and the centralized facilities represent a more cost effective alternative. (2)  The commissioner may waive a facilities efficiency standard if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that the waiver will not adversely affect the educational adequacy of the school facility, including the ability to deliver the programs and services necessary to enable all students to achieve the core curriculum content standards. (3)  To house the district's central administration, a district may request an adjustment to the approved areas for unhoused students of 2.17 square feet for each FTE student in the projected total district school enrollment if the proposed administrative offices will be housed in a school facility and the district demonstrates either that the existing central administrative offices are obsolete or that it is more practical to convert those offices to instructional space.  To the extent that existing administrative space will continue to be used for administrative purposes, the space shall be included in the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7). If the commissioner approves excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs based upon the additional area allowances or excess facilities efficiency standards pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7).  In the event that the commissioner does not approve the excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances, the district may either: modify its submission so that the school facilities project meets the facilities efficiency standards; or pay for the excess costs. (4)  The commissioner shall approve spaces in excess of, or inconsistent with, the facilities efficiency standards, hereinafter referred to as nonconforming spaces, upon a determination by the district that the spaces are necessary to comply with State or federal law concerning individuals with disabilities, including that the spaces are necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled pupils who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled pupil population.  A district may apply for additional State aid for nonconforming spaces that will permit pupils with disabilities to be educated to the greatest extent possible in the same buildings or classes with their nondisabled peers.  The nonconforming spaces may: (a) allow for the return of pupils with disabilities from private facilities; (b) permit the retention of pupils with disabilities who would otherwise be placed in private facilities; (c) provide space for regional programs in a host school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils; and (d) provide space for the coordination of regional programs by a county special services school district, educational services commission, jointure commission, or other agency authorized by law to provide regional educational services in a school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils.  A district's State support ratio shall be adjusted to equal the lesser of the sum of its district aid percentage as defined in section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) plus 0.25, or 100 percent for any nonconforming spaces approved by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph. h.   Upon approval of a school facilities project and determination of the preliminary eligible costs: (1)  In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall notify the district whether the school facilities project is approved and, if so approved, the preliminary eligible costs and the excess costs, if any. Following the determination of preliminary eligible costs and the notification of project approval, the district may appeal to the commissioner for an increase in those costs if the detailed plans and specifications completed by a design professional for the school facilities project indicate that the cost of constructing that portion of the project which is consistent with the facilities efficiency standards and does not exceed the area allowances per FTE student exceeds the preliminary eligible costs as determined by the commissioner for the project by 10 percent or more.  The district shall file its appeal within 30 days of the preparation of the plans and specifications.  If the district chooses not to file an appeal, then the final eligible costs shall equal the preliminary eligible costs. The appeal shall outline the reasons why the preliminary eligible costs calculated for the project are inadequate and estimate the amount of the adjustment which needs to be made to the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall forward the appeal information to the development authority for its review and recommendation.  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted as the final eligible costs.  If the development authority determines the additional costs are not within the control of the district or are the result of design factors required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner a final eligible cost based on its experience for districts with similar characteristics, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the commissioner shall not approve an adjustment to the preliminary eligible costs which exceeds 10 percent of the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall make a determination on the appeal within 30 days of its receipt. If the commissioner does not approve an adjustment to the school facilities project's preliminary eligible costs, the commissioner shall issue his findings in writing on the reasons for the denial and on why the preliminary eligible costs as originally calculated are sufficient. (2)  In the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall promptly prepare and submit to the development authority a preliminary project report which shall consist, at a minimum, of the following information:  a complete description of the school facilities project; the actual location of the project; the total square footage of the project together with a breakdown of total square footage by functional component; the preliminary eligible costs of the project; the project's priority ranking determined pursuant to subsection m. of this section; any other factors to be considered by the development authority in undertaking the project; and the name and address of the person from the district to contact in regard to the project. i.    Upon receipt by the development authority of the preliminary project report, the development authority, upon consultation with the district, shall prepare detailed plans and specifications and schedules which contain the development authority's estimated cost and schedule to complete the school facilities project.  The development authority shall transmit to the commissioner its recommendations in regard to the project which shall, at a minimum, contain the detailed plans and specifications; whether the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs; and any other factors which the development authority determines should be considered by the commissioner. (1)  In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs: the final eligible costs shall be deemed to equal the preliminary eligible costs; the commissioner shall be deemed to have given final approval to the project; and the preliminary project report shall be deemed to be the final project report delivered to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (2)  In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project cannot be completed within the preliminary eligible costs, prior to the submission of its recommendations to the commissioner, the development authority shall, in consultation with the district and the commissioner, determine whether changes can be made in the project which will result in a reduction in costs while at the same time meeting the facilities efficiency standards approved by the commissioner. (a)  If the development authority determines that changes in the school facilities project are possible so that the project can be accomplished within the scope of the preliminary eligible costs while still meeting the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall so advise the commissioner, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs; give final approval to the project with the changes noted; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (b)  If the development authority determines that it is not possible to make changes in the school facilities project so that it can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs either because the additional costs are the result of factors outside the control of the district or the additional costs are required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be increased accordingly, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the sum of the preliminary eligible costs plus the increase recommended by the development authority; give final approval to the project; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section. (c)  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards or approved pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection g. of this section, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted, whereupon the commissioner shall: calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs and specify the excess costs which are to be borne by the district; give final approval to the school facilities project; and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section; provided that the commissioner may approve final eligible costs which are in excess of the preliminary eligible costs if, in his judgment, the action is necessary to meet the educational needs of the district. (d) For a school facilities project undertaken by the development authority, the development authority shall be responsible for any costs of construction, but only from the proceeds of bonds issued by the financing authority pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) and P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.), which exceed the amount originally projected by the development authority and approved for financing by the development authority, provided that the excess is the result of an underestimate of labor or materials costs by the development authority.  After receipt by the development authority of the final project report, the district shall be responsible only for the costs associated with changes, if any, made at the request of the district to the scope of the school facilities project. j.    The development authority shall not commence the construction of a school facilities project unless the commissioner transmits to the development authority a final project report and the district complies with the approval requirements for the local share, if any, pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-11).  The final project report shall contain all of the information contained in the preliminary project report and, in addition, shall contain: the final eligible costs; the excess costs, if any; the total costs which equals the final eligible costs plus excess costs, if any; the State share; and the local share. k.   For the SDA districts, the State share shall be 100 percent of the final eligible costs.  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9) , for all other districts, the State share shall be an amount equal to the district aid percentage; except that the State share shall not be less than 40 percent of the final eligible costs. If any district which is included in district factor group A or B, other than an SDA district, is having difficulty financing the local share of a school facilities project, the district may apply to the commissioner to receive 100 percent State support for the project and the commissioner may request the approval of the Legislature to increase the State share of the project to 100 percent. l.    The local share for school facilities projects constructed by the authority or a redevelopment entity shall equal the final eligible costs plus any excess costs less the State share. m.  (1) Within 90 days of the effective date of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et al.), the commissioner shall develop an educational facilities needs assessment for each SDA district.  The assessment shall be updated periodically by the commissioner in accordance with the schedule the commissioner deems appropriate for the district; except that each assessment shall at a minimum be updated within five years of the development of the district's most recent prior educational facilities needs assessment.  The assessment shall be transmitted to the development authority to be used to initiate the planning activities required prior to the establishment of the educational priority ranking of school facilities projects pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)  Following the approval of an SDA district's long-range facilities plan or of an amendment to that plan, but prior to authorization of preconstruction activities for a school facilities project included in the plan or amendment, the commissioner shall establish, in consultation with the SDA district, an educational priority ranking of all school facilities projects in the SDA district based upon the commissioner's determination of critical need in accordance with priority project categories developed by the commissioner.  The priority project categories shall include, but not be limited to, health and safety, overcrowding in the early childhood, elementary, middle, and high school grade levels, spaces necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled students who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled student population, rehabilitation, and educational adequacy. (3)  (a) Upon the commissioner's determination of the educational priority ranking of school facilities projects in SDA districts pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, the SDA districts, and the governing bodies of the municipalities in which the SDA districts are situate, shall establish a Statewide strategic plan to be used in the sequencing of SDA district school facilities projects based upon the projects' educational priority rankings and issues which impact the development authority's ability to complete the projects including, but not limited to, the construction schedule and other appropriate factors.  The development authority shall revise the Statewide strategic plan and the sequencing of SDA district school facilities projects in accordance with that plan no less than once every five years, except that the plan shall be updated within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). In addition to any other information that the development authority may deem appropriate, the Statewide strategic plan shall include a description of the project, which shall indicate whether the project will be new construction or renovation and whether the project will require the acquisition of land. (b)  In developing the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall prioritize: (i) new construction projects; (ii) projects located on land owned by the school district or other public entities; and (iii) projects needed to replace school buildings that have been in use for 100 or more years. (c) Any amendment to an SDA district's long-range facilities plan that is submitted to the commissioner in the period between the five-year updates of the long-range facilities plan shall be considered by the development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, for incorporation into the Statewide strategic plan.  In making a determination on whether or not to amend the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall consider the cost of the amendment, the impact of the amendment upon the school development plans for other districts, and other appropriate factors. (d) Within 10 days following any update to the Statewide strategic plan, the development authority shall transmit the plan to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), and to the members of the Senate Education Committee and the Assembly Education Committee, or any successor committees. (4)  In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall establish a priority process for the financing of school facilities projects based upon the commissioner's determination of critical need in accordance with priority project categories developed by the commissioner.  The priority project categories shall include, but not be limited to, health and safety, overcrowding in the elementary, middle, and high school grade levels, spaces necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled students who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled student population, and full-day kindergarten facilities in the case of school districts required to provide full-day preschool pursuant to section 12 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-54). n.   The provisions of the "Public School Contracts Law," N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., shall be applicable to any school facilities project constructed by a district but shall not be applicable to projects constructed by the development authority or a redevelopment entity pursuant to the provisions of this act. o.   In the case of a school facilities project of a district other than an SDA district, any proceeds of school bonds issued by the district for the purpose of funding the project which remain unspent upon completion of the project shall be used by the district to reduce the outstanding principal amount of the school bonds. p.   Upon completion by the development authority of a school facilities project, if the cost of construction and completion of the project is less than the total costs, the district shall be entitled to receive a portion of the local share based on a pro rata share of the difference based on the ratio of the State share to the local share. q.   The development authority shall determine the cause of any costs of construction which exceed the amount originally projected by the development authority and approved for financing by the financing authority. r.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.137). s.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.137). (cf: P.L.2009, c.185, s.1) 5.  (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) or any other section of law to the contrary, the board of education of a district other than an SDA district may enter into an agreement with a county improvement authority to construct a school facilities project and to issue its bonds to finance the local share of a project that is to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (18A:7G-15), or to finance the total costs of a project that is not to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15).  The bonds of a county improvement authority issued to finance the total costs of a school facilities project that is not to be financed pursuant to section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15) shall be eligible for State debt service aid in accordance with the formula established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9). b.    A district other than an SDA district may lease its lands or facilities to the county improvement authority, which may construct the school facilities project.  Whenever a school facilities project is constructed by a county improvement authority pursuant to the provisions of this section, the improvement authority shall follow the applicable public bidding procedures or requirements under the Public School Contracts Law, N.J.S.18A:18A-1 et seq., section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60), or sections 34 through 41 of P.L.2021, c.71 (C.18A:18A-61 through C.18A:18A-68). c.     The county improvement authority shall lease the school facilities project to the county, which shall then lease it for nominal consideration to the district for as long as the county improvement authority bonds or refunding bonds are outstanding.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize a county to require the district to bear any portion of the cost of the debt service on the county improvement authority bonds issued to fund the school facilities project or any refunding bonds. d.    The county lease payments made to the county improvement authority pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall not be subject to any cap on appropriations or on spending or to any tax levy cap.  The county lease payments shall be sufficient to pay debt service on the county improvement authority bonds issued to fund the school facilities project, or any refunding bonds, that remains after the application of any State debt service aid paid on those bonds pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9).  The county lease payments shall be payable over the life of the bonds. e.     When the bonds issued by a county improvement authority are no longer outstanding, the leases and liens of the county and the county improvement authority shall expire and the school facilities project shall be solely vested in the school district.  The school district shall be responsible for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of the school facility upon the completion of the school facilities project. 6.  Section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9) is amended to read as follows: 9.   a. State debt service aid for capital investment in school facilities for a district other than an SDA district which elects not to finance the project under section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15), shall be distributed upon a determination of preliminary eligible costs by the commissioner, according to the following formula: Aid is the sum of A for each issuance of school bonds issued for a school facilities project approved by the commissioner after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.) where A = B x AC/P x   DAP x M, with AC/P =1 whenever AC/P would otherwise yield a number greater than one, and where: B is the district's debt service for the individual issuance for the fiscal year; AC is the preliminary eligible costs determined pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-7); P is the principal of the individual issuance plus any other funding sources approved for the school facilities project; DAP is the district's district aid percentage as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3) and where DAP shall not be less than 40 percent. If the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment, the DAP shall be increased by no more than five percent. In order to qualify for a DAP increase for the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment pursuant to this subsection, a district shall submit to the development authority and Department of Education a certification, along with evidential documentation, attesting that the projects design incorporates the implementation of energy efficiency improvements or the installation of energy efficient features or equipment; and M is a factor representing the degree to which a district has fulfilled maintenance requirements for a school facilities project determined pursuant to subsection b. of this section. For county special services school districts, DAP shall be that of the county vocational school district in the same county.

(3)  The development authority, in consultation with the commissioner, shall develop and implement training programs, seminars, or symposia to provide technical assistance to SDA districts deemed to lack the capacity to manage a school facility project or projects; except that nothing herein shall be construed to require the development authority or the commissioner to authorize an SDA district to hire additional staff in order to achieve capacity. (4)  If the development authority determines to delegate a school facilities project to an SDA district in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, the development authority, the commissioner, and the district shall enter into a grant agreement. The grant agreement shall, at a minimum, establish a timeline for the completion of the school facilities project, which timeline shall be established based on the scope of the work to be performed. (5) If the development authority determines to delegate a school facilities project to an SDA district in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, the SDA district shall be deemed to be in noncompliance with the grant agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection if the district enters into a contract with a contractor, subcontractor, or consultant which is debarred, suspended, or disqualified from State, development authority, or federal government contracting at the time of the contract award1 or with a firm which has not been prequalified by the development authority. If the district enters into a contract with a debarred, suspended, or disqualified contractor, subcontractor, or consultant, then the grant agreement shall be rendered null and void.

The remaining funds for school facilities projects shall be disbursed to the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grants Fund. (cf: P.L.2008, c.39, s.4) 10. Section 15 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-15) is amended to read as follows: 15. a. In the case of a district other than an SDA district, for any project approved by the commissioner after the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), the district may elect to receive a one-time grant for the State share of the project in accordance with the provisions of subsection b. of this section rather than annual debt service aid under section 9 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-9).  The State share payable to the district shall equal the product of the project's final eligible costs and the district aid percentage or 40 percent, whichever is greater.

(New section) a. There is hereby created within the development authority an Emergent Condition Remediation Program to provide for the financing of emergent projects in the public schools of SDA districts, which public schools shall not include charter schools or renaissance school projects physically located in the SDA districts. Emergent projects financed under the program shall be funded by moneys from the SDA District Emergent Project Fund established pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection i. of section 14 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-14). b.

The prequalified contractors that are part of the pool of contractors established pursuant to this subsection shall be available for any emergent project in any SDA district. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring the retainer of prequalified contractors for specific emergent projects. c.     As used in this section, emergent project means a school facilities project or other capital project eligible for State funding that would alleviate a condition that, if not corrected on an expedited basis, would render a building or facility so potentially injurious or hazardous that it causes an imminent peril to the health and safety of students or staff. 21.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, an SDA district to which the development authority has delegated management of a school facilities project shall not enter into a cooperative pricing system or agreement for construction services on school facilities projects. 22.  N.J.S.18A:18A-4 is amended to read as follows: 18A:18A-4.  a.  Every contract for the provision or performance of any goods or services, the cost of which in the aggregate exceeds the bid threshold, shall be awarded only by resolution of the board of education to the lowest responsible bidder after public advertising for bids and bidding therefor, except as is provided otherwise in this chapter or specifically by any other law. The board of education may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board of education and subject to subsections b. and c. of this section, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder, if the board of education finds that: (1)  any board of education has had prior negative experience with the bidder  within the past 10 years, as reported in a contractor evaluation submitted pursuant to N.J.S. 18A:18A-15; or (2)  in the case of a contract for a school facilities project as defined in section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), there has been at least one instance of prior negative experience with the bidder by any board of education, or by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, or any combination thereof, as reported in a contractor evaluation submitted pursuant to N.J.S.18A:18A-15, a school facilities project performance evaluation, or in a mandatory uniform performance evaluation conducted pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-36), as appropriate. b.    As used in this section, "prior negative experience" means any of the following: (1)   the bidder has been found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have: failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a prior contract with a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (2)   the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, to utilize the services of another contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or complete the contract; (3)   the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, to look to the bidder's surety for completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; (4)   the bidder is debarred or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award, whether or not the action was based on experience with a board of education or, in the case of a school facilities project, with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority or the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (5)  the bidders prequalification to bid on a school facilities project, which prequalification was granted pursuant to the process established by the development authority under section 59 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-33), has been revoked by the New Jersey Schools Development Authority; (6)  the bidder has been suspended from contracting or engaging in work or services on a school facilities project; or (7)  the bidders prequalification to submit bids on a school facilities project has been revoked pursuant to subsection b. of section 61 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-35) or subsection b. of section 62 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-36). c.     The following conditions apply if the board of education is contemplating a disqualification based on prior negative experience: (1)   The existence of any of the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not require that a bidder be disqualified.  In each instance, the decision to disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the board of education and shall be rendered in the best interests of the board of education. (2)   All mitigating factors shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted. (3)   The bidder shall be furnished by the board of education with a written notice (a) stating that a disqualification is being considered; (b) setting forth the reason for the disqualification; and (c) indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing before the board of education if the bidder so requests within a stated period of time.  At the hearing, the bidder shall show good cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and testimony.  If the board of education determines that good cause has not been shown by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and, thus, disqualified. (4)   Disqualification shall be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years. (5)   A disqualification, other than a disqualification pursuant to which a board of education is prohibited by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period thereof may be reduced, in the discretion of the board of education, upon the submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, such as reversal of a judgment, or actual change of ownership, management or control of the bidder. (6)   An opportunity for a hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey.  The term of such a disqualification shall be concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or department. d.    The purchase of text books and materials that exceed the bid threshold and are approved by a board of education pursuant to N.J.S.18A:34-1 shall not require the further adoption of a resolution for purchase. (cf: P.L.2002, c.90, s.1) 23.  (New section)  a.  Within 120 days of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Education, in consultation with the New Jersey Schools Development Authority, shall, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), promulgate regulations for school districts concerning the incorporation of construction contract provisions that encourage the completion of construction projects on schedule. b.    At a minimum, the regulations shall include sample provisions that school districts may include in future issuances of construction contracts.  In addition to any other considerations that the commissioner may deem appropriate, the regulations shall prescribe: (1)   industry-leading penalties for the late delivery of projects by contractors; and (2)   incentives for contractors who deliver projects on time and under budget. 24.  Section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  As used in this section: "Authority" means the New Jersey Economic Development Authority established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1974, c.80 (C.34:1B-4).

The long-range maintenance plan shall be approved by the State Treasurer pursuant to regulations promulgated by the State Treasurer that reflect national building maintenance standards and other appropriate building maintenance benchmarks. (4)   The State Treasurer, in consultation with the authority, the Commissioner of the Department of Education, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Schools Development Authority, shall review all completed applications, and request additional information as is needed to make a complete assessment of the project. No public-private partnership agreement shall be executed until approval has been granted by the State Treasurer.

A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each municipal and county local government body in the geographic area affected by the proposal. (5)   After the proposal or proposals have been received, and any public notification period has expired, the school district shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the school district shall rely upon, at minimum, the evaluation criteria promulgated by the State Treasurer, in consultation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Department of Education, and Schools Development Authority.  In addition, the local school district may consider factors that include, but may not be limited to, professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering, architectural services, or cost-reduction terms, finance plans, and the need for school district funds to deliver the project and discharge the agreement. The private entity selected shall comply with all laws and regulations required by the State government entity, including but not limited to section 1 of P.L.2001, c.134 (C.52:32-44), sections 2 through 8 of P.L.1975, c.127 (C.10:5-32 to 38), section 1 of P.L.1977, c.33 (C.52:25-24.2), P.L.2005, c.51 (C.19:44A-20.13 et al.); P.L.2005, c.271 (C.40A:11-51 et al.), Executive Order No. 117 of 2008, Executive Order No. 118 of 2008, Executive Order No. 189, prior to executing the public private partnership agreement.

(6)   The school district may require, upon receipt of one or more proposals, that the private entity assume responsibility for all costs incurred by the school district before execution of the public-private partnership agreement, including costs of retaining independent experts to review, analyze, and advise the school district with respect to the proposal. (7)   The school district shall set aside one percent of each project and remit it the Public-Private Partnership Review fund established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.52:18A-260), for purposes of plan review and analysis required under the bill. (8)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as or deemed a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the State, the local government unit or an affected locality or public entity or any officer or employee thereof with respect to the participation in or approval of all or any part of the public-private project. (cf: P.L.2018, c.90, s.2) 25.  N.J.S.18A:21-4 is amended to read as follows: 18A:21-4.  A board of education may in any school year draw against its capital reserve account, up to the amount of the balance therein, to the extent that the withdrawal is anticipated as a revenue in the school budget for the then current school year or approved by the commissioner for good cause; provided, that no money drawn from the account may be used for current expenses of the general fund or debt service payments but shall be used exclusively for capital expenses of the general fund or capital projects fund when expressly authorized as part of a referendum, except as provided for in section 2 of P.L.2018, c.90 (C.18A:18A-60). (cf: P.L.1996, c.138, s.52) 26. Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows: 12. The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided. When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). Delivery by the municipal clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by the clerk that the exemption has been terminated. Within 10 calendar days following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational purposes. Whenever an exemption status changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper. a.   The financial agreement shall specify the duration of the exemption for urban renewal entities in accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1)  the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or (2)  for each project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection, "redevelopment agreement" means an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. A financial agreement may provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection. b.   During the term of any exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings and improvements of the project and, to the extent authorized pursuant to this section, on the land, the urban renewal entity shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (1)  An annual amount equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the annual gross revenue from each unit of the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project, if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross revenue shall not be more than 15% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, nor less than 10% in the case of all other projects. At the option of the municipality, or where because of the nature of the development, ownership, use or occupancy of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is to be undertaken in units, the total annual gross rental or gross shelter rent or annual gross revenue cannot be reasonably ascertained, the governing body shall provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The percentage of the total project cost or total project unit cost shall not be more than 2% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, and shall not be less than 2% in the case of all other projects. (2)  In either case, the financial agreement shall establish a schedule of annual service charges to be paid over the term of the exemption period, which shall be in stages as follows: (a)  For the first stage of the exemption period, which shall commence with the date of completion of the unit or of the project, as the case may be, and continue for a time of not less than six years nor more than 15 years, as specified in the financial agreement, the urban renewal entity shall pay the municipality an annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project in an annual amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11).  For the remainder of the period of the exemption, if any, the annual service charge shall be determined as follows: (b)  For the second stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 20% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (c)  For the third stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 40% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (d) For the fourth stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 60% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; and (e)  For the final stage of the exemption period, the duration of which shall not be less than one year and shall be specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 80% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater. If the financial agreement provides for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project,  less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement, the financial agreement shall set forth a schedule of annual service charges for the exemption period which shall be based upon the minimum service charges and staged adjustments set forth in this section. The annual service charge shall be paid to the municipality on a quarterly basis in a manner consistent with the municipality's tax collection schedule. Each municipality which enters into a financial agreement on or after the effective date of P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) shall remit five percent of the annual service charge collected by the municipality to the county in accordance with the provisions of R.S.54:4-74. If the municipality enters into a contract with a board of education pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the municipality shall also remit to the board of education such amounts as may be required under the contract. Against the annual service charge the urban renewal entity shall be entitled to credit for the amount, without interest, of the real estate taxes on land paid by it in the last four preceding quarterly installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of the financial agreement, the minimum annual service charge shall be the amount of the total taxes levied against all real property in the area covered by the project in the last full tax year in which the area was subject to taxation, and the minimum annual service charge shall be paid in each year in which the annual service charge calculated pursuant to this section or the financial agreement would be less than the minimum annual service charge. c.   All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall terminate at the time prescribed in the financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), the project, all affected parcels, land and all improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as are other taxable properties in the municipality.  After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end upon the entity's rendering its final accounting to and with the municipality. (cf: P.L.2018, c.97, s.17) 27. Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-237) is amended to read as follows: 3. a.  There is established in, but not of, the Department of the Treasury a public body corporate and politic, with corporate succession, to be known as the "New Jersey Schools Development Authority."

STATEMENT This bill provides various changes to the laws governing the construction of school facilities projects and the operations of the New Jersey Schools Development Authority (SDA). Model School Designs The bill requires the SDA, in consultation with the Commissioner of Education, to establish a model school design program that would establish uniform standards for the exterior and interior design of school facilities projects. The bill defines the components of the model school design program. The bill requires all projects in SDA districts to conform to the standards of the model school design program. Non-SDA Projects The bill also provides several changes to the laws governing the construction of school facilities projects in non-SDA school districts. The bill allows a school district to raise bonds for a school facilities project without the approval of the voters of the district if the school district enters into a contract with one or more municipalities, wherein the municipality provides the district with not less than 60 percent of the payments in lieu of taxes received from one or more designated properties, and the district pledges those monies to the repayment of the bonds.  However, after entering into the contract, the school district would also be required to submit an application to the commissioner before issuing the bonds without voter approval. Additionally, the bill permits the board of education of a district other than an SDA district to enter into an agreement with a county improvement authority to construct a school facilities project and to issue bonds to finance certain portions of the project. The bill also permits a board of education of a school district to draw against its capital reserve account in order to finance a portion of a project for which a school district and private entity enter into a public-private partnership agreement pursuant to current law. The bill also requires the commissioner, in consultation with the SDA, to promulgate regulations concerning the incorporation of construction contract provisions that encourage the completion of construction projects on schedule. SDA Finances and Operations The bill provides that bonds issued by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) for the State share of school facilities projects, the proceeds of which are transferred to the SDA, will not support the costs of either agency related to the issuance of the bonds. Bonds issued after the effective date of the committee substitute will not support the administrative, non-project insurance, operating and other expenses of the EDA to issue the bonds. Under the committee substitute, the costs related to the undertaking of the planning, design, and construction of school facilities projects will also not be supported by bonds issued after the substitutes effective date. These administrative costs would instead be annually supported by State appropriations. The bill also requires the SDA to establish three funds in which the net proceeds of the bonds issued for school facilities projects, and any State appropriations for school facilities projects, would be deposited. The three funds are as follows: (1) the SDA District Project Fund; (2) the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grants Fund; and (3) the SDA District Emergent Project Fund. The bill stipulates that no less than 70 percent of any appropriations providing direct funding for school facilities projects would be appropriated for SDA district school facilities projects and SDA district emergent needs. The remaining funds would be disbursed to the Regular Operating District Construction and Maintenance Grant Fund. School Facilities Projects of Charter Schools and Renaissance School Projects in SDA Districts and the Charter School and Renaissance School Project Facilities Loan Program. The bill establishes the Charter School and Renaissance School Project Facilities Loan Program, which would provide eligible borrowers with a loan, including but not limited to subordinate loans, to undertake or facilitate school facilities projects for non-profit charter schools and non-profit renaissance school projects located in an SDA district.
