(cf: P.L.2015, c.72, s.10) 10.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the Liberty State Park Protection Act, would preserve Liberty State Park as a public urban green open space with authority for limited privatization by establishing certain requirements concerning actions by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) related to Liberty State Park and establishing a Liberty State Park Advisory Committee (committee). The bill would prohibit the DEP from considering any proposal to commercialize, develop, or privatize Liberty State Park, except as provided in the bill.  The bill would restrict the DEP from conveying, leasing, or otherwise transferring any property rights within the 235-acre natural restoration area in the interior of Liberty State Park, and at Caven Point Peninsula.  The bill would require the DEP, within five years after the bill is enacted into law, and after consultation with the committee, to develop a management plan for Liberty State Park.  The DEP would be required to consult the committee for review and recommendations: (1) prior to entering into any agreement for a concession, conveyance, or lease or any other transfer of property rights; and (2) prior to the extension or renewal for a term of one year or longer any lease in effect on the date the bill is enacted into law.  In addition, the bill directs the DEP to develop and implement, in conjunction with the committee, a public participation process to allow public citizens and civic organizations to provide public input on any proposed changes in land use at Liberty State Park or to the management plan developed pursuant the bill, and to also, at least once each year, hold a public forum to receive input from the public concerning plans, improvements, preservation, conservation, and management of the park, in addition to any public hearings that may be required pursuant to law.  The bill also directs the DEP to develop a map depicting Liberty State Park. Under the bill, the DEP would only approve an agreement for a concession, conveyance, lease, or other agreement with a private entity to provide small-scale commercial activities if the agreement enhances the experience of a visitor to Liberty State Park, such as a bicycle or kayak rental concession, food concession, temporary winter skating rink, commercial boat tour operating from an existing boat slip, and use of the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (CRRNJ Terminal), and other uses identified in the management plan developed pursuant to the bill. In addition, whenever the DEP proposes to enter into a concession, lease, or other agreement for a duration of one year or longer, the DEP would be required to present the proposal to the committee for review and recommendations and provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposal, including holding two public hearings at Liberty State Park, with one hearing being held on a weekday evening and one on the weekend, and providing a 30-day public comment period.  In addition, the DEP would be required to take these same actions when it intends to convey lands acquired or developed by the State with Green Acres funds, or acquired or developed by the State in any other manner and administered by the department, located within or adjacent to Liberty State Park. The Liberty State Park Advisory Committee established by the bill would be charged with assisting the DEP in conserving, preserving, protecting, and improving Liberty State Park. In carrying out its responsibilities, the committee would give due consideration to the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources and the local, State, and national significance of Liberty State Park. The committees responsibilities would include: assisting the DEP in developing the management plan required by the bill, and advising the DEP on the ecological restoration of the 235-acre interior portion of the park and means to increase public access and public enjoyment of the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources of the park; reviewing and making recommendations concerning concessions, leases, or other transfer of property rights with a duration of one year or longer; and submitting to the DEP Commissioner any recommendations the committee deems necessary to improve, protect the park. In addition, this bill would amend the State Park and Forestry Resources Act, P.L.1983, c. 324 (C.13:1L-1 et seq.), which, in part, allows the DEP to enter agreements with private entities for the construction, operation, and maintenance for private profit of any facility, utility, or device in State parks and forests as the DEP finds proper for the use and enjoyment of the lands by the public.  This bill would amend the law to reflect the provisions of this bill concerning agreements related to Liberty State Park. Lastly, the bill would amend the Hackensack Meadowlands Agency Consolidation Act to delete the provision that provided the commission, i.e., the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which under current law is also referred to as the Meadowlands Regional Commission, with certain authority concerning Liberty State Park.

STATEMENT This bill, to be known as the Liberty State Park Protection Act, would preserve Liberty State Park as a public urban green open space with authority for limited privatization by establishing certain requirements concerning actions by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) related to Liberty State Park and establishing a Liberty State Park Advisory Committee (committee). The bill would prohibit the DEP from considering any proposal to commercialize, develop, or privatize Liberty State Park, except as provided in the bill.  The bill would restrict the DEP from conveying, leasing, or otherwise transferring any property rights within the 235-acre natural restoration area in the interior of Liberty State Park, and at Caven Point Peninsula.  The bill would require the DEP, within five years after the bill is enacted into law, and after consultation with the committee, to develop a management plan for Liberty State Park.  The DEP would be required to consult the committee for review and recommendations: (1) prior to entering into any agreement for a concession, conveyance, or lease or any other transfer of property rights; and (2) prior to the extension or renewal for a term of one year or longer any lease in effect on the date the bill is enacted into law.  In addition, the bill directs the DEP to develop and implement, in conjunction with the committee, a public participation process to allow public citizens and civic organizations to provide public input on any proposed changes in land use at Liberty State Park or to the management plan developed pursuant the bill, and to also, at least once each year, hold a public forum to receive input from the public concerning plans, improvements, preservation, conservation, and management of the park, in addition to any public hearings that may be required pursuant to law.  The bill also directs the DEP to develop a map depicting Liberty State Park. Under the bill, the DEP would only approve an agreement for a concession, conveyance, lease, or other agreement with a private entity to provide small-scale commercial activities if the agreement enhances the experience of a visitor to Liberty State Park, such as a bicycle or kayak rental concession, food concession, temporary winter skating rink, commercial boat tour operating from an existing boat slip, and use of the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal (CRRNJ Terminal), and other uses identified in the management plan developed pursuant to the bill. In addition, whenever the DEP proposes to enter into a concession, lease, or other agreement for a duration of one year or longer, the DEP would be required to present the proposal to the committee for review and recommendations and provide an opportunity for public comment on the proposal, including holding two public hearings at Liberty State Park, with one hearing being held on a weekday evening and one on the weekend, and providing a 30-day public comment period.  In addition, the DEP would be required to take these same actions when it intends to convey lands acquired or developed by the State with Green Acres funds, or acquired or developed by the State in any other manner and administered by the department, located within or adjacent to Liberty State Park. The Liberty State Park Advisory Committee established by the bill would be charged with assisting the DEP in conserving, preserving, protecting, and improving Liberty State Park. In carrying out its responsibilities, the committee would give due consideration to the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources and the local, State, and national significance of Liberty State Park. The committees responsibilities would include: assisting the DEP in developing the management plan required by the bill, and advising the DEP on the ecological restoration of the 235-acre interior portion of the park and means to increase public access and public enjoyment of the natural, historic, cultural, recreational, and scenic resources of the park; reviewing and making recommendations concerning concessions, leases, or other transfer of property rights with a duration of one year or longer; and submitting to the DEP Commissioner any recommendations the committee deems necessary to improve, protect the park. In addition, this bill would amend the State Park and Forestry Resources Act, P.L.1983, c. 324 (C.13:1L-1 et seq.), which, in part, allows the DEP to enter agreements with private entities for the construction, operation, and maintenance for private profit of any facility, utility, or device in State parks and forests as the DEP finds proper for the use and enjoyment of the lands by the public.  This bill would amend the law to reflect the provisions of this bill concerning agreements related to Liberty State Park. Lastly, the bill would amend the Hackensack Meadowlands Agency Consolidation Act to delete the provision that provided the commission, i.e., the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which under current law is also referred to as the Meadowlands Regional Commission, with certain authority concerning Liberty State Park.
