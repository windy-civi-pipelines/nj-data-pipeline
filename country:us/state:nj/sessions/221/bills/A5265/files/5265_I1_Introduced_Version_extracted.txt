The use of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude use of any other remedy specified. b.    Any person to which an order or assessment of civil administrative penalty or a notice of revocation of a certificate or business permit is issued has 20 days from the receipt of the order to deliver to the board or the local enforcing agency a written request for a hearing.  Upon receipt of that request, the board or the local enforcing agency shall determine whether to conduct the hearing itself or refer the matter to the Office of Administrative Law, which shall assign an Administrative Law Judge to conduct a hearing in the form of a contested case pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  If the matter is referred to the Office of Administrative Law, the board or the local enforcing agency shall affirm, reject, or modify the decision within 45 days of receipt of the Administrative Law Judge's initial decision by issuing its own final decision. The board's or the local enforcing agencys action shall be considered the final agency action for the purposes of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), and shall be subject only to judicial review as provided in the Rules of Court. c.     If no hearing is requested, an order becomes a final order upon the expiration of the 20-day period.  This final order shall be considered the final agency action for the purposes of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), and shall be subject only to judicial review as provided in the Rules of Court.  Payment of an administrative penalty is due when a final order is issued or when the order becomes a final order.  Pending the determination by the board and upon application by a person to whom an order or notice of revocation is issued, the board or the local enforcing agency may stay operation of an order upon such terms and conditions as it deems proper. (cf: P.L.2009, c.229, s.9) 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill proposes to enhance enforcement of the "Landscape Irrigation Contractor Certification Act of 1991," P.L.1991, c.27 (C.45:5AA-1 et seq.), by empowering local enforcing agencies to: institute civil actions for injunctive or other appropriate relief, and assess civil administrative penalties, upon those who appear to have violated the act or the rules adopted pursuant thereto.  Currently, the Department of Community Affairs is solely responsible for enforcement of the act, however, the department appears to lack sufficient staff to inspect job sites around the State to ascertain whether contractors are violating the act. The bill proposes to address this staffing shortage by allowing each local (construction code) enforcing agency to inspect, fine, and shut down a work site if it is determined that a contractor has violated a provision of the act, including the provision that requires a contractor to be licensed in order to perform irrigation work. Additionally, the bill increases the amount a person may be penalized for violating the act to not more than $5,000 for the first offense, not more than $10,000 for the second offense, and not more than $15,000 for each subsequent offense.  Thirty percent of the revenue derived from the civil penalties and civil administrative penalties are to be deposited into the State General Fund, and 70 percent of the revenue derived from the proposed increase in civil penalties and in civil administrative penalties are to be retained by the municipality or pilot county in which the violation occurred.
