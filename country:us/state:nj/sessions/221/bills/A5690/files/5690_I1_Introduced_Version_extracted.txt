No primary election ballot used in this State shall include any distinguishing mark or notation, except as otherwise provided by law. c.   Each county clerk shall: (1) allow for the placement of a slogan or endorsement of not more than six words next to or below the names of candidates, in the same font and color as the name, but in a smaller font size, provided that the slogan or endorsement shall not be in bold or italicized fonts, and provided that the slogan or endorsement complies with R.S.19:23-17; (2) allow candidates for the same office with multiple open seats to associate in the same office block, using a common slogan or endorsement, next to or below the associated candidate names, in compliance with the provisions of R.S.19:23-18; and (3) indicate the association of candidates for the same or different offices using a common slogan or endorsement next to or below each of the candidates names, as provided by R.S.19:23-17. d.   In addition to complying with the provisions of this section, each county clerk may: (1) arrange and design the ballot in either landscape or portrait orientation; and (2) label candidate ballot draw positions using a letter and number, such as 1A, corresponding to the office block and line each candidate is placed on, and place such label next to a candidates name. e.     The Secretary of State, in consultation with all county clerks, shall promulgate uniform guidelines for all county clerks to follow in order to comply with the requirements of this section. (cf: P.L.2025, c.32, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, county clerks are required to label each position on a primary election ballot with a number and letter, such as 1A, corresponding to the line of the ballot where candidate names are placed. This bill would allow, rather than require, each county clerk to determine whether or not they want to use such labels on primary election ballots in their respective counties.
