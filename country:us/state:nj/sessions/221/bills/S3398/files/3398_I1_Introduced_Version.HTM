<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This committee substitute
would require certain manufacturers and distributors of products that utilize
packaging to adopt and implement plans to decrease the amount of packaging that
is disposed of as solid waste, and to pay an annual surcharge to the State, the
proceeds of which would be used to improve the State's recycling system.  The
bill would also establish a new Office of Plastics and Packaging Management in
the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to oversee the administration
and enforcement of laws dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
DEP, within one year after the bill's enactment, to conduct a needs assessment
of the State's solid waste and recycling system.  The needs assessment would be
required to include, among other things, an estimate of the costs of solid
waste and recycling infrastructure upgrades that are necessary for the State to
meet the recycling rate targets for packaging products established in section 5
of the bill.  The bill would require the DEP to update the needs assessment
every five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would authorize
producers covered under the bill to collaborate in meeting the bill's
requirements by forming producer responsibility organizations (PROs).  The DEP
would be authorized to approve up to 10 PROs.  A PRO would be authorized to
submit a single packaging product stewardship plan that covers all producers
that are members of the PRO, and to take other actions to facilitate producers'
compliance with the bill's provisions.  The bill would also authorize producers
to comply with the bill's provisions individually, if they so choose.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5 of the bill would
establish certain requirements concerning the sale and composition of packaging
products.  First, it would require that, by 2032, the cumulative amount of single-use
packaging products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into
the State be reduced by 25 percent in volume.  At least 10 percent of this
reduction would be required to be achieved by shifting to reusable products or
by eliminating plastic components.  Second, it would require that, by 2034, all
packaging products be either compostable or recyclable.  Third, it would
require that, by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in the State be
at least 65 percent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require each
PRO, no later than 5 years after the bill's enactment, to develop and implement
a packaging product stewardship plan (plan).  Each PRO would be required to
first submit a draft of its plan to the Advisory Council on Solid Waste
Management, established pursuant to the &quot;Solid Waste Management Act,&quot;
P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), for review and comment.  The PRO would then
be required to submit its plan to the DEP for approval.  The bill would
establish various requirements for the content of a plan, including that it identify
the strategies that will be used by participating producers to reduce, through
product design modifications and program innovation, the amount of material
that is used for each packaging product and the amount of waste resulting from the
use of each packaging product.  The plan would also be required to include a
detailed budget, which would be required to be evaluated by an independent
financial auditor to ensure that it is sufficient to costs of implementing the
plan.  The PRO would raise money to fund the implementation of the plan by
imposing fees on its members.  The fees would be proportional to the amount of
packaging produced by the member, as well as the environmental impact of the
packaging.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also establish
the &quot;Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; in the Department of the
Treasury.  Moneys in the fund would be used to (1) fund efforts to improve the
State's recycling system, as identified in the Statewide needs assessment, in
the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the DEP, or (2) to
administer and enforce the provisions of the bill.  Each PRO (and any producers
not participating in a PRO) would be assessed an annual surcharge by the
Division of Taxation in the Treasury, and the moneys from the surcharge would
be placed in the &quot;Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund.&quot;  The total
Statewide surcharge would be the amount needed during the following fiscal year
to administer and enforce the bill's provisions and improve the State's
recycling system in order to meet the recycling rate and other targets
established by section 5 of the bill, as determined by the Statewide needs
assessment, up to a maximum of $120 million.  The amount owed by each PRO or
non-participating producer would be a prorated share of this total amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     PROs and non-participating
producers would be required by the bill to engage in public outreach, to
address public questions and concerns, and to provide consumers with
educational and informational materials related to the stewardship plan and the
services that are available thereunder.  PROs and non-participating producers
would also be authorized to provide educational and informational materials to
retailers regarding the implementation of the stewardship plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would establish an
Office of Plastics and Packaging Management (office) in the DEP.  The purpose
of the office would be to oversee the administration and enforcement of this
bill, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135
et seq.), and any other law dealing with pollution from plastic and other
packaging.  The office would include an Inspector General, who would, among
other things, act as a liaison between the DEP, the Department of Law and
Public Safety, county prosecutor's offices, and other local governments,
regarding the enforcement of laws under the purview of the office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would amend existing
law to add several duties regarding the implementation of the bill's provisions
to the duties of the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management (council),
including a duty to review packaging product stewardship plans submitted by
PROs and non-participating producers.  The bill would also require certain
existing recommendations from the council to be provided to the DEP
commissioner at least every five years, rather than &quot;from time to time,&quot;
as stated in current law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
establish various civil and administrative penalties for persons who violate
the provisions of the bill, any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto,
any stewardship plan approved thereunder, or any order issued by the DEP commissioner
in enforcing the bill. </p>
