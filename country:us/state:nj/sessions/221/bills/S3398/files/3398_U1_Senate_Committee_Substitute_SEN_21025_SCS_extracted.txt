(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (2) the costs actually or expected to be incurred: (a) by local governments, service providers, and other collection programs in association with the implementation of the product stewardship plan and the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (b) by the PRO for the reimbursement of service providers for services provided under the plan; (c) in association with consumer outreach and education efforts undertaken as part of the product stewardship plan; (d) in association with the transportation of covered products to a recycling center, broker, or viable and responsible end market; (e) in association with the cleaning, sorting, aggregating, and baling of covered products, as necessary to bring those materials to a viable and responsible end market; (f) in association with the administration and operation of the producer responsibility organization; and (g) in association with the surcharge imposed pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.  The budget developed under this section shall be evaluated by an independent financial auditor, as designated by the department, to ensure that the budget is sufficient to cover all of the costs associated with implementation of the stewardship plan. e.  (1) A product stewardship plan shall provide a methodology for reimbursement to service providers that provide collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, recovering, preparing, reuse, recycling, composting, or other waste-reduction services for covered materials, exclusive of exempt materials.  The methodology shall consider estimated revenue received by service providers from the sale of materials based upon relevant material indices and incorporate relevant cost information identified by the needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Reimbursement rates shall be annually updated and shall reflect the net costs expended by service providers, at a minimum.  Reimbursement rates shall be established equivalent to net costs as established by a methodology in an approved plan as follows: (a) no less than 50 percent of the net cost no later than three years after the date of plan approval; (b) no less than 75 percent of the net cost no later than four years after the date of plan approval; and (c) no less than 90 percent of the net cost no later than five years after the date of plan approval, and each year thereafter. (2) Reimbursement rates shall be based on the following, as applicable to the services provided: (a) the cost to collect covered materials for recycling, a proportional share of composting, or reuse, adjusted to reflect conditions that affect those costs, varied by region or jurisdiction in which the services are provided, including but not limited to: (i) the number and type of persons or locations that are serviced by the service provider; (ii) the population density of the service area; (iii) the collections methods employed; (iv) the distance traveled by collection vehicles to consolidation or transfer facilities; to reuse, recycling, or composting facilities; and to responsible end markets; (v) other factors that may contribute to regional or jurisdictional cost differences; (vi) the proportion of compostable materials within all source-separated compostable materials collected or managed through composting; and (vii) the general quality of the materials collected by the service provider; (b) the cost to transfer collected covered products from consolidation or transfer facilities to reuse, processing, recycling, or composting facilities or to responsible end markets; (c) the cost to: (i) sort and process covered products for sale or use and remove contamination from the materials by a recycling or composting facility, less the average fair market value for that covered material based on market indices for the region; and (ii) manage contamination removed from collected covered products; (d) the administrative costs of service providers, including education, public awareness campaigns, and outreach program costs as applicable; and (e) the costs of covered services for a refill system or covered services provided for reusable covered products and management of contamination. (3) A service provider may retain all revenue from the sale of covered products. Nothing in P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall restrict a service provider from charging a fee for services, to the extent that reimbursement from a producer responsibility organization does not cover all costs of services, including continued investment and innovation in operations, operating profits, and returns on investments required by a service provider to provide sustainability of the services. f.  A PRO or producer, as applicable, shall annually raise sufficient revenue to fully fund all costs identified in its budget.  For a PRO, the revenue shall be raised through a system of fees imposed on producers that are members of a producer responsibility organization.  The fee system shall impose fees on producers in proportion to the amount, measured by weight, of covered products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State by the producer.  In addition, the fee system shall impose fees that are proportional to the environmental impact of the covered products, consistent with the following provisions: (1) covered products that are certified as being reusable or reused shall be levied the lowest fee possible that covers the cost of the product's reuse system; (2) covered products that are composed of recycled content, are recyclable, or are compostable shall be levied a reduced fee; (3) the fees shall be inversely proportional to the percentage of recycled content in the products, and the ease of recycling the products; (4) the fees shall be proportional to the amount of virgin material used in the products, and the percentage of non-compostable materials, including plastic, in the product; (5) the presence of hazardous materials in the products, as identified by the Department of Health or the department, shall be associated with a higher fee; and (6) the incorporation of elements, including, but not limited to, inks, labels, and adhesives, that prevent an otherwise recyclable or compostable product from being recyclable or compostable, as applicable, shall be associated with a higher fee. g.  A product stewardship plan may include a system to credit producers for source reduction efforts carried out during the five-year period immediately preceding the baseline year established pursuant to subsection a. of section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The credit system, and the associated source reduction efforts, shall be documented and described in detail in the product stewardship plan and shall take into consideration the environmental impacts of the source reduction efforts as follows: (1) switching from single-use packaging products to a reusable or refillable format shall be granted the highest credit; (2) switching from non-recyclable packaging products to recyclable or compostable materials shall be granted a lower credit; (3) reducing the amount of packaging, measured by average weight and volume of packaging per product sold, offered for sale, or distributed into the State shall be granted a lower credit; and (4) switching from packaging products that were recyclable or compostable to a single-use plastic material shall be excluded from the credit system. 8.  (New section) a.  Not more than 120 days after receipt of a completed product stewardship plan, submitted pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the plan and provide written notice of the determination to the PRO or producer, as applicable.  If the commissioner does not provide written notice of the determination made pursuant to this section within the timeframe specified by this subsection, the plan shall be deemed to have been approved, and the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall proceed to implement the plan as provided by paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section.  In making a determination pursuant to this section, the commissioner may solicit information from the representatives of recycling facilities and other stakeholders as the commissioner deems appropriate. b.    A stewardship plan shall not be approved, pursuant to this section, unless the commissioner determines that: (1)   the PRO or producer, as applicable, has engaged in satisfactory consultation with stakeholders in the development of the plan; (2)   the plan adequately addresses all of the elements described in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the objectives of the plan will be met; and (3)   the plan contains an adequate financing mechanism, developed pursuant to subsection f. of section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and a budget that has been verified by an independent financial auditor. c.     (1)  If a product stewardship plan is approved pursuant to this section, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the approved plan within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner's written notice or after the expiration of the 120-day period established by subsection a. of this section, as the case may be, or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner. (2)   If a product stewardship plan is conditionally approved pursuant to this section, the commissioner's written notice shall specify the conditions that are to be satisfied in order for the plan to be deemed approved pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the conditionally approved plan, in accordance with the conditions specified in the notice, either within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner's notice or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner. (3)   If a product stewardship plan is disapproved pursuant to this section, the commissioner's written notice shall be accompanied by a detailed statement describing the reasons for disapproval.  Not more than 30 days after receipt of the commissioner's notice and accompanying statement of the reasons for disapproval, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall submit a revised product stewardship plan to the commissioner, who shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove of the revised plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of this section. d.    Not more than 90 days after approving a product stewardship plan pursuant to this section, or any revisions thereto, the commissioner shall post the plan at a publicly accessible location on the department's Internet website, together with a list of the producers participating in the plan and a list of the products covered thereunder. e.     (1)  A stewardship plan approved pursuant to this section shall be reviewed and updated by the PRO or producer, as applicable, and reapproved by the commissioner, at least once every five years, in accordance with the procedures specified in this section. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to the contrary, the commissioner may, at any time, review a previously approved product stewardship plan to determine whether the plan is being implemented in accordance with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  If the commissioner, at any time, finds that the approved plan, as implemented, is deficient, the commissioner may order the PRO or producer, as applicable, to incorporate modifications to the plan or to the implementation thereof, as may be necessary to ensure that the plan, as implemented, fully complies with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 9.  (New section) a.  No later than 18 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and annually thereafter, a service provider seeking reimbursement for services provided under an approved product stewardship plan pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall register with the department by submitting the following information: (1) the contact information for a person representing the service provider; (2) the address of the service provider; and (3) if applicable to services provided, a report of the total amount billed for collection, processing services, and transfer station operations provided during the preceding calendar year and, when possible, values shall be separated for collection, transfer, and processing. b.  A service provider receiving reimbursement or funding under an approved product stewardship plan shall: (1) provide collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, recovering, preparing, reuse, recycling, composting, or other waste-reduction services for covered products, as applicable to the services offered by, and the service area of, the service provider; (2) register with the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section; (3) submit invoices to the producer responsibility organization for reimbursement for services rendered as provided in section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (4) meet any performance standards established in the applicable approved product stewardship plan; (5) ensure that covered products are sent to responsible end markets; (6) provide documentation to the producer responsibility organization on the amounts of covered products, measured by weight, types of covered products, and volumes of materials processed, sorted by service method; (7) display the service provider's price, minus the reimbursement from the producer responsibility organization, as determined in section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when invoicing customers.  The balance is what the service provider may charge the customer; and (8) comply with all other applicable requirements of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 10.  (New section) a.  There is established the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" as a separate, non-lapsing fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" shall be credited with all surcharges, interest, penalties, and other amounts collected and paid to the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to this section.  Moneys in the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" shall be expended only to: (1) fund efforts identified in a Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the department; (2) to administer or enforce the provisions of sections 1 through 17 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including the transfer of moneys into the General Fund to repay moneys expended by the department or any other State agency during fiscal years prior to the deposit of moneys in the fund; or (3) to otherwise implement an approved product stewardship plan.  Prior to making an expenditure from the fund, the department shall consult with the producer responsibility organization approved pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and shall follow the recommendations of the producer responsibility organization regarding expenditures from the fund, provided that the department determines that the expenditures are in the public interest, and that any producer responsibility organization seeking grant moneys from the fund is in compliance with the financial responsibility provisions of paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  Pending the use thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section, the monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for other monies in the fund. c.  Commencing 30 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer shall pay an annual surcharge as assessed by the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, to be deposited in the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund." The total amount of the surcharge shall be the lesser of: (1) the amount of funding required during the next fiscal year to fund the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure and systems upgrades needed for producers to meet the requirements of section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), as determined in the Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), plus the amount needed to administer and enforce P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) during the next fiscal year; and (2) $120 million. d.  The amount owed by each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer shall be a prorated proportion of the total amount, based on the market share of covered products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State by a producer responsibility organization's members or the non-participating producer, as applicable, as determined by the department. e.  On or before March 1 of each year beginning six years after the effective date of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall transmit, to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, documentation identifying the name and address of each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer who is liable for the surcharge imposed under this section and the amount of the surcharge to be assessed against each such person; and providing a contact number for a department staff member who is able to respond to questions about the surcharge.  The director shall transmit, to each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer who is liable for the surcharge imposed under this section, a written determination to that effect. f.  Moneys appropriated from the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" shall not replace or reduce the allocation of any other funding. 11.  (New section) a.  A PRO or non-participating producer shall conduct public outreach and provide consumers with educational and informational materials, in a form and manner prescribed by the department, related to the applicable product stewardship plan and the services provided thereunder.  The PRO and producers shall also respond to questions, and address concerns, that are directly raised by consumers in association with the implementation of the stewardship plan. b.    The outreach conducted, and the educational and informational materials provided, under this section, shall: (1)   provide information on the proper end-of-life management of discarded covered products, including the end-of-life recycling and other environmentally sound disposal options that are available under the stewardship plan, as well as the location and availability of curbside and drop-off collection opportunities; (2)   provide instructions to enable consumers to carry out the recycling or composting of discarded covered products, which instructions shall be easily accessible, easy to understand, and, to the extent practicable, applicable on a Statewide basis, taking into account the differences among local laws and processing capabilities; (3)   describe the environmental impact associated with the improper disposal of covered products, and encourage consumers to avoid the littering of discarded covered products; (4)   notify consumers that producers will be responsible for covering the costs of implementing the stewardship plan; and (5)   provide consumers with any other information required by the department. c.     The public outreach and education program established pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall: (1)   utilize all available forms of media, including, but not limited to, television, radio, print media, signage, the Internet, and social media, to provide information directly to consumers in the State; (2)   be coordinated with the various municipalities in the State and incorporate electronic, print, web-based, and social media elements that individual municipalities may elect to use, at their discretion, to provide education directly to their residents; (3)   to the extent deemed necessary and appropriate, provide for producers to affix, to their covered products, a label that contains information necessary to help consumers responsibly manage and recycle the covered products at the end of their useful life.  A producer may satisfy this requirement through the use of a quick-response (QR) code, provided that the code directs consumers to an Internet website that contains information that is up-to-date and specific to New Jersey; and (4)   to the extent practicable, be coordinated with other similar public outreach and education programs in the State, as necessary to avoid consumer confusion and facilitate the consolidated use of available resources. d.    In addition to engaging in public outreach and education, as required by subsection a. of this section, a PRO or non-participating producer shall be authorized to provide retailers with educational and informational materials related to a product stewardship plan, the services provided thereunder, and the role of retailers in facilitating the successful implementation of the plan.  The educational and informational materials provided to a retailer under this subsection may include, but need not be limited to, printed materials, signage, templates of materials that can be reproduced by retailers and provided thereby to consumers at the time of a product's purchase, and advertising materials that promote consumer participation in the product stewardship plan. 12.  (New section) a.  Not more than one year after an approved product stewardship plan is implemented pursuant to subsection c. of section 8 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and annually thereafter, a PRO or non-participating producer, as applicable, shall submit a written report to the department evaluating the implementation of the plan.  Each annual report shall include, but need not be limited to, the following information: (1)   a list of the producers participating in the plan and the products covered under the plan; (2)   a description of the methods used to collect, transport, reuse, or recycle discarded covered products under the stewardship plan, in accordance with environmentally sound management practices; (3)   the total amount, measured by weight, of discarded covered products collected under the stewardship plan; (4)   the total amount, measured by weight, of collected covered products that have been disposed under the stewardship plan, by method of disposition, including reuse, recycling, and disposal in accordance with environmentally sound management practices; (5)   the total cost of implementing the stewardship plan, as determined by an independent financial audit, including separate figures for the costs of collection, transportation, reuse, recycling, disposal, outreach, and any other activities that involved the expenditure of funds under the stewardship plan; (6)   samples of the educational materials that have been provided, to consumers and retailers pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), together with an evaluation of the methods used to disseminate those materials and an assessment of the effectiveness of those materials, including associated levels of waste prevention and reuse or recycling that have been evidenced since outreach efforts were commenced pursuant to section 11 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (7)   an evaluation of the effectiveness of the stewardship plan, including the PRO's progress in meeting the performance targets established by section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and any steps necessary to improve the plan's effectiveness; and (8)   any other information required by the commissioner. b.    Within 90 days after receipt of each annual report submitted pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall: (1)   review the report; (2)   post the report on the department's Internet website; and (3)   prepare, and post on the department's Internet website, a summary report describing the progress that is being made under the stewardship plan and any corrective action ordered by the commissioner pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     The department shall not disclose any financial, production, or sales data reported by a producer pursuant to this section, except that the department may disclose such data in aggregate or summary format, provided that the producers and their financial, production, or sales data are not specifically identified, and provided that the summary omits any reference to unique characteristics from which the identities of individual producers might be inferred or otherwise ascertained. 13. (New section) a.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner may: (1)   issue an order, in accordance with subsection b. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the stewardship plan approved thereunder, as the case may be; (2)   bring a civil action in accordance with subsection c. of this section; (3)   levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection d. of this section; (4)   bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section; or (5) notify the public of a producer that is not in compliance with the requirements of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. b.    Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person: specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the person's compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order.  The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing. After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. c.     The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or of a stewardship plan approved thereunder.  Such relief may include, singly or in combination: (1)   a temporary or permanent injunction; (2)   recovery of the reasonable costs of any investigation or inspection that led to the discovery of the violation, and for the recovery of the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing a civil action commenced under this subsection; (3)   recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection; and (4)   recovery of compensatory damages caused by a violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection.  Assessments under this subsection shall be paid to the State Treasurer, except that compensatory damages may be paid by specific order of the court to any persons who have been aggrieved by the violation. d.    (1)  The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent. (2)   Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 35 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. (3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. e.     A person who violates any provision of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. f.     All penalties collected by the department pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be deposited into the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" established pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and appropriated annually for the continued administration and enforcement of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 14.  (New section) a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, an action undertaken by a producer or group of producers, which affects the types or quantities of covered products being recycled or the cost or structure of any collection or recycling program, shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement the organized collection or recycling of covered products pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: (1)   any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a product; or (2)   any agreement restricting the output or production of a product or the geographic area or customers to which a product will be sold. 15.  (New section) a.  A covered product shall be exempt from the requirements of sections 1 through 17 of P.L.    , c.

(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall restrict a service provider from charging a fee for services, to the extent that reimbursement from a producer responsibility organization does not cover all costs of services, including continued investment and innovation in operations, operating profits, and returns on investments required by a service provider to provide sustainability of the services. f.  A PRO or producer, as applicable, shall annually raise sufficient revenue to fully fund all costs identified in its budget.  For a PRO, the revenue shall be raised through a system of fees imposed on producers that are members of a producer responsibility organization.  The fee system shall impose fees on producers in proportion to the amount, measured by weight, of covered products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State by the producer.  In addition, the fee system shall impose fees that are proportional to the environmental impact of the covered products, consistent with the following provisions: (1) covered products that are certified as being reusable or reused shall be levied the lowest fee possible that covers the cost of the product's reuse system; (2) covered products that are composed of recycled content, are recyclable, or are compostable shall be levied a reduced fee; (3) the fees shall be inversely proportional to the percentage of recycled content in the products, and the ease of recycling the products; (4) the fees shall be proportional to the amount of virgin material used in the products, and the percentage of non-compostable materials, including plastic, in the product; (5) the presence of hazardous materials in the products, as identified by the Department of Health or the department, shall be associated with a higher fee; and (6) the incorporation of elements, including, but not limited to, inks, labels, and adhesives, that prevent an otherwise recyclable or compostable product from being recyclable or compostable, as applicable, shall be associated with a higher fee. g.  A product stewardship plan may include a system to credit producers for source reduction efforts carried out during the five-year period immediately preceding the baseline year established pursuant to subsection a. of section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The credit system, and the associated source reduction efforts, shall be documented and described in detail in the product stewardship plan and shall take into consideration the environmental impacts of the source reduction efforts as follows: (1) switching from single-use packaging products to a reusable or refillable format shall be granted the highest credit; (2) switching from non-recyclable packaging products to recyclable or compostable materials shall be granted a lower credit; (3) reducing the amount of packaging, measured by average weight and volume of packaging per product sold, offered for sale, or distributed into the State shall be granted a lower credit; and (4) switching from packaging products that were recyclable or compostable to a single-use plastic material shall be excluded from the credit system. 8.  (New section) a.  Not more than 120 days after receipt of a completed product stewardship plan, submitted pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the plan and provide written notice of the determination to the PRO or producer, as applicable.  If the commissioner does not provide written notice of the determination made pursuant to this section within the timeframe specified by this subsection, the plan shall be deemed to have been approved, and the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall proceed to implement the plan as provided by paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section.  In making a determination pursuant to this section, the commissioner may solicit information from the representatives of recycling facilities and other stakeholders as the commissioner deems appropriate. b.    A stewardship plan shall not be approved, pursuant to this section, unless the commissioner determines that: (1)   the PRO or producer, as applicable, has engaged in satisfactory consultation with stakeholders in the development of the plan; (2)   the plan adequately addresses all of the elements described in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the objectives of the plan will be met; and (3)   the plan contains an adequate financing mechanism, developed pursuant to subsection f. of section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and a budget that has been verified by an independent financial auditor. c.     (1)  If a product stewardship plan is approved pursuant to this section, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the approved plan within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner's written notice or after the expiration of the 120-day period established by subsection a. of this section, as the case may be, or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner. (2)   If a product stewardship plan is conditionally approved pursuant to this section, the commissioner's written notice shall specify the conditions that are to be satisfied in order for the plan to be deemed approved pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the conditionally approved plan, in accordance with the conditions specified in the notice, either within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner's notice or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner. (3)   If a product stewardship plan is disapproved pursuant to this section, the commissioner's written notice shall be accompanied by a detailed statement describing the reasons for disapproval.  Not more than 30 days after receipt of the commissioner's notice and accompanying statement of the reasons for disapproval, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall submit a revised product stewardship plan to the commissioner, who shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove of the revised plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of this section. d.    Not more than 90 days after approving a product stewardship plan pursuant to this section, or any revisions thereto, the commissioner shall post the plan at a publicly accessible location on the department's Internet website, together with a list of the producers participating in the plan and a list of the products covered thereunder. e.     (1)  A stewardship plan approved pursuant to this section shall be reviewed and updated by the PRO or producer, as applicable, and reapproved by the commissioner, at least once every five years, in accordance with the procedures specified in this section. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to the contrary, the commissioner may, at any time, review a previously approved product stewardship plan to determine whether the plan is being implemented in accordance with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  If the commissioner, at any time, finds that the approved plan, as implemented, is deficient, the commissioner may order the PRO or producer, as applicable, to incorporate modifications to the plan or to the implementation thereof, as may be necessary to ensure that the plan, as implemented, fully complies with the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 9.  (New section) a.  No later than 18 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and annually thereafter, a service provider seeking reimbursement for services provided under an approved product stewardship plan pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall register with the department by submitting the following information: (1) the contact information for a person representing the service provider; (2) the address of the service provider; and (3) if applicable to services provided, a report of the total amount billed for collection, processing services, and transfer station operations provided during the preceding calendar year and, when possible, values shall be separated for collection, transfer, and processing. b.  A service provider receiving reimbursement or funding under an approved product stewardship plan shall: (1) provide collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, recovering, preparing, reuse, recycling, composting, or other waste-reduction services for covered products, as applicable to the services offered by, and the service area of, the service provider; (2) register with the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section; (3) submit invoices to the producer responsibility organization for reimbursement for services rendered as provided in section 7 of P.L.    , c.

(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), when invoicing customers.  The balance is what the service provider may charge the customer; and (8) comply with all other applicable requirements of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 10.  (New section) a.  There is established the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" as a separate, non-lapsing fund in the Department of the Treasury.  The "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" shall be credited with all surcharges, interest, penalties, and other amounts collected and paid to the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to this section.  Moneys in the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" shall be expended only to: (1) fund efforts identified in a Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the department; (2) to administer or enforce the provisions of sections 1 through 17 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including the transfer of moneys into the General Fund to repay moneys expended by the department or any other State agency during fiscal years prior to the deposit of moneys in the fund; or (3) to otherwise implement an approved product stewardship plan.  Prior to making an expenditure from the fund, the department shall consult with the producer responsibility organization approved pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and shall follow the recommendations of the producer responsibility organization regarding expenditures from the fund, provided that the department determines that the expenditures are in the public interest, and that any producer responsibility organization seeking grant moneys from the fund is in compliance with the financial responsibility provisions of paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  Pending the use thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section, the monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for other monies in the fund. c.  Commencing 30 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer shall pay an annual surcharge as assessed by the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, to be deposited in the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund." The total amount of the surcharge shall be the lesser of: (1) the amount of funding required during the next fiscal year to fund the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure and systems upgrades needed for producers to meet the requirements of section 6 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), as determined in the Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.

(New section) a.  Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner may: (1)   issue an order, in accordance with subsection b. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of P.L.    , c.

Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified. b.    Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person: specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the person's compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person's right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order.  The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing. After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order.  If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period.  A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order. c.     The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of P.L.    , c.

(2)   Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed.  The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing.  The ordered party shall have 35 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing.  After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice.  If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35-day period.  Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. (3)   The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied.  The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate. e.     A person who violates any provision of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense.  Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner.  In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation. f.     All penalties collected by the department pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be deposited into the "Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund" established pursuant to section 10 of P.L.    , c.

(C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 14.  (New section) a.  Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, an action undertaken by a producer or group of producers, which affects the types or quantities of covered products being recycled or the cost or structure of any collection or recycling program, shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement the organized collection or recycling of covered products pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: (1)   any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a product; or (2)   any agreement restricting the output or production of a product or the geographic area or customers to which a product will be sold. 15.  (New section) a.  A covered product shall be exempt from the requirements of sections 1 through 17 of P.L.    , c.
