for cannabis is not to be done as part of a pre-employment screening, except
for the employees outlined in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of 48 of P.L.2021,
c.16.  The bill provides an employer may determine to employ or not to employ a
Workplace Impairment Recognition Expert in the employers discretion.  Nothing
in subsection a. of section 48 of P.L.2021, c.16 is to be interpreted to
require that an employer use a Workplace Impairment Recognition Expert for
either drug testing or determinations of suspicion of an employees usage of a
cannabis item while engaged in the performance of the employees work
responsibilities.  Further, the use of the Workplace Impairment Recognition
Expert is not to be deemed the industry standard for testing or making suspicion
determinations.  An employer may use scientifically reliable testing services
and exercise its own judgment in making a good faith suspicion determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that an
employer is not to take any action which has the effect of prohibiting an
employee using cannabis products during non-work hours except under the

an employer that the nature of the work of an employee at a critical

categories of these employees, or a specific employee of an employer, is to be made

responsible for approving an application upon finding that the standards in the
bill have been met;</p>

49 U.S.C. s. 5331; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  when the employer is

law enforcement officer and the duties of the employment require the possession
of a firearm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 2 of the bill amends
N.J.S.A. 52:17B-71 to require that the Police Training Commission consult with
the Cannabis Regulatory Commission with respect to developing standards and
course curricula for certification as a Workplace Impairment Recognition Expert
in detecting and identifying an employees use of, or impairment from, a
cannabis item or other intoxicating substance, and for assisting in the
