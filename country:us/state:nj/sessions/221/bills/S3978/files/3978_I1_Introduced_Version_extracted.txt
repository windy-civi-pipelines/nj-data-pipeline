This bill expands the protections provided under current law for pregnant students to parenting students.  Under the bill, a parenting student is defined as a student enrolled in an institution of higher education who is the parent or legal guardian of a child under 18 years of age.  The bill also requires the institutions discrimination policy to be posted at a publicly available location on its Internet website.  The bill clarifies that a student is not required to reapply for admission at the institution following a leave period.
