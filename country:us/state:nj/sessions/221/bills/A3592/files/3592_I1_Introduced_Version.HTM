requiring written explanation for rent increases, supplementing chapter 27D of
Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1974, c.49..</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  The Legislature
finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  <span style='font-size:
11.5pt;line-height:150%'>The cost of housing in New Jersey, including rental
housing, constitutes one of the most substantial financial challenges faced by
New Jersey residents;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:150%'>     b.  Due to the housing shortage in this State, in
addition to the disparity in bargaining power between residential tenants and
their landlords, a significant number of </span>New Jersey residents struggle
to afford and dispute rent increases by their landlords;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  New Jersey law requires a
landlord to provide a written notice to the tenant whenever the landlord
intends to increase rent, and a written notice to quit, or terminate, the
tenancy at the end of the lease term;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  <span style='font-size:
11.5pt;line-height:150%'>State law has not set forth a precise limit on rent
increases, but has instead required that a rent increase not be
&quot;unconscionable,&quot; which may be asserted as a defense to an eviction
by a residential tenant pursuant to subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.49
(C.2A:18-61.1);</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:150%'>     e.  The term &quot;unconscionable&quot; has been defined
on a case-by-case basis by the courts using the multi-factor test set forth in
case law, which requires, among the other factors, a court to look at a
landlords expenses and profitability, and determine whether the rent increase </span>would
<span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>&quot;</span>shock the
conscience<span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>&quot;</span> of a
reasonable person;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Due to the summary nature
of landlord-tenant proceedings, limited discovery, case-by-case determinations
of unconscionability, disparity of bargaining power, and limited precedent
setting forth a bright line standard for unconscionable rent increases,
residential tenants are limited in their ability to collect sufficient
information in advance of the landlords increase or, if necessary, eviction
proceedings, to dispute a rent increase; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  Therefore, the Legislature
finds and declares that to protect the health, housing stability, financial
security, and well-being of residential tenants, it is in the public interest
to require a landlord, when raising rent, to provide a tenant written
explanation for the rent increase, and certain, critical information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section)  A landlord
who violates paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection f. of section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1) shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  be liable to a penalty of
$500, which shall be collected and enforced by summary proceedings pursuant to
the &quot;Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et
seq.).  The Superior Court, Law Division, Special Civil Part in the county in
which the residential rental property is located shall have jurisdiction over
the proceedings.  Process shall be in the nature of a summons or warrant, and
shall issue upon the complaint of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the
Attorney General; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  at the discretion of the
tenant, be subject to a separate cause of action by the tenant in the Superior
Court, Law Division, Special Civil Part in the county in which the rental
premises are located.  The tenant may recover $500 for each offense by the
landlord, in addition to reasonable attorneys fees or expenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    No lessee or tenant or
the assigns, under-tenants or legal representatives of such lessee or tenant
may be removed by the Superior Court from any house, building, mobile home or
land in a mobile home park or tenement leased for residential purposes, other
than (1) owner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units or a
hotel, motel or other guest house or part thereof rented to a transient guest
or seasonal tenant; (2) a dwelling unit which is held in trust on behalf of a
member of the immediate family of the person or persons establishing the trust,
provided that the member of the immediate family on whose behalf the trust is
established permanently occupies the unit; and (3) a dwelling unit which is
permanently occupied by a member of the immediate family of the owner of that
unit, provided, however, that exception (2) or (3) shall apply only in cases in
which the member of the immediate family has a developmental disability, except
upon establishment of one of the following grounds as good cause:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The person fails to pay
rent due and owing under the lease whether the same be oral or written;
provided that, for the purposes of this section, any portion of rent unpaid by

line-height:150%'>     The cost of housing in New Jersey, including rental
housing, constitutes one of the most substantial financial challenges faced by
residents of this State.  Due to the housing shortage, in addition to the
disparity in bargaining power between residential tenants and their landlords,
a significant number of </span>New Jersey residents struggle to afford rent and
dispute rent increases by their landlords.  New Jersey law requires a landlord
to provide a written notice to the tenant whenever the landlord intends to increase
rent, and a written notice to quit, or terminate, the tenancy at the end of the
lease term.  <span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%'>State law has not
set forth a precise limit on rent increases, but has instead required that a
rent increase not be &quot;unconscionable,&quot; which may be asserted as a
defense to an eviction by a residential tenant pursuant to subsection f. of
section 2 of P.L.1974, c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1).  The term
&quot;unconscionable&quot; is defined on a case-by-case basis by the courts
using the multi-factor test set forth by <u>Fromet Properties, Inc. v. Buel</u>,
294 N.J. Super. 601 (App. Div. 1996), which requires, among the other factors,
a court to look at a landlords expenses and profitability, and determine
whether the rent increase </span>would shock the conscience of a reasonable
person.  Due to the summary nature of landlord-tenant proceedings, limited
discovery, case-by-case determinations of unconscionability, disparity of
bargaining power, and limited precedent setting forth a bright line standard
for unconscionable rent increases, residential tenants are limited in their
ability to collect sufficient information in advance of the landlords increase
or, if necessary, eviction proceedings, and dispute a rent increase. 
Therefore, to protect the public health, housing stability, financial security,
and well-being of residential tenants, it is in the public interest to require
a landlord to provide a tenant written explanation for a rent increase and
provide certain, specific notices.</p>
