Legislative Budget and Finance Officer shall, not later than the seventh day
after any Legislative action which repeals, impairs, or amends section 19 of
P.L.2016, c.57 (C.52:18A-257) and increases the rate of tax imposed pursuant to

which increases the rate of tax imposed pursuant to the Sales and Use Tax
Act, P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.).  The fiscal estimate of the increase

difference in total State revenue collected from the tax imposed pursuant to
the Sales and Use Tax Act, P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) during the
preceding State fiscal year and the anticipated total amount of revenue to be

day after the Legislative Budget and Finance Officers fiscal estimate is

both, of petroleum products other than highway fuel and aviation fuel and which
distributes such products in this State a tax at the rate of seven percent of
its gross receipts derived from the first sale of petroleum products within this
State <u>,</u> and there is imposed on each company which is engaged in the
refining or distribution, or both, of highway fuel a tax at the rate of 12.85
percent, as adjusted pursuant to subsection c. of this section, of its gross
receipts derived from the first sale of those products within this State.</p>

cents-per-gallon rate, rounded to the nearest tenth of a cent, and adjusted
quarterly by the director, effective on July 1, October 1, January 1, and April
1, based on the average retail price per gallon of unleaded regular gasoline in
the State, as determined in the most recent survey of the retail price per
gallon of gasoline that includes a Statewide representative random sample
conducted by the Board of Public Utilities, Office of the Economist, or its
successor.</p>

be converted to a cents-per-gallon rate, rounded to the nearest tenth of a
cent, and adjusted quarterly by the director, effective on July 1, October 1,
January 1, and April 1, based on the average retail price per gallon of number
2 diesel in the State, as determined in the most recent survey of retail diesel
fuel prices that includes a Statewide representative random sample conducted by
the Board of Public Utilities, Office of the Economist, or its successor.</p>

the Legislative action, provide a fiscal estimate to the Director of the
Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury of the anticipated
amount of State revenue to be generated as a result of the Legislative action
which increases the sales and use tax rate.  The estimate is to be calculated
