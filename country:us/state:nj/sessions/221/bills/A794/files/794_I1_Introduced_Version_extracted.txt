STATEMENT This bill prohibits the payment by the State, local governments, and boards of education of supplemental compensation to any current or future public officer or employee for accumulated unused sick leave earned after the bills effective date.  The bill will take effect the first day of the second month following enactment. Supplemental compensation for any sick leave earned prior to that date but not used will be payable as under current law. In addition, the bill imposes limits on the carry-forward of vacation leave that is not used in a given year by any current or future employee of the State, a local government, or board of education.

The bill prohibits the use of six or more consecutive days of accumulated sick leave in the twelve months prior to retirement, without medical necessity verified in writing by a physician, by a current or future public officer or employee.  The employer may require the officer or employee to submit to an examination by a physician selected by the employer to verify the medical necessity.  There are penalties for violations of this provision.  For the first violation, the employer will treat the time taken as unpaid leave and impose a minimum disciplinary penalty of a fine in an amount equal to one and one-half times the daily rate of compensation for each day of violation.  For the second violation, in addition to treating the time as unpaid leave, the employer will impose a minimum disciplinary penalty of a fine in an amount equal to three times the daily rate of compensation for each day of violation.  For the third violation, in addition to treating the time taken as unpaid leave, the employer will have good cause to terminate the employee. The minimum penalties set forth for the first and second violations may be increased at the discretion of the employer, based upon the prior record of the employee.  The time converted to unpaid leave will also be deducted from the number of unused accumulated sick leave days credited on the effective date of retirement. Certain provisions of the bill would apply after the expiration of a collective negotiations agreement or individual contract of employment with a relevant provision in effect on the bills effective date.
