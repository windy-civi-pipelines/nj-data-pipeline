Under the bill, DCA would establish one grant program for public water systems that have less than 500 service connections for the purpose of funding improvements to the operational sustainability of eligible small public water systems through the identification and prevention of potable water loss due to leaks, breaks, and other metering or infrastructure failures. The bill also directs DCA to establish a second grant program for all public water systems, for the purpose of improving the sharing of information concerning water quality, water infrastructure needs, and water technology, including cybersecurity technology, between or among public water systems. For both programs, the bill would direct DCA to establish grant application processes and transparent eligibility and ranking criteria, and publish them on the DCA website no later than six months after the bill's effective date.  The bill would also direct DCA to determine maximum grant amounts to ensure that grants are distributed throughout the State.  Under the bill, DCA may use up to three percent of the money allocated to administer each program. The bill directs DCA, no later than three years after the bill's enactment, to prepare and submit reports to the Governor and the Legislature that provide details about the projects funded by the grant programs.  After the report is submitted, or three years after the bill's enactment, whichever is sooner, the bill would expire.
