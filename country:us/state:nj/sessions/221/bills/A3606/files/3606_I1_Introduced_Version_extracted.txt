and Whereas, Research supports that early screening and intervention can help young people avoid the destructive consequences of drug and alcohol misuse and addiction; and Whereas, Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a set of effective prevention and treatment tools that helps identify alcohol or drug problems and guides follow-up intervention and treatment if a problem exists; and Whereas, New Jersey has implemented SBIRT with adults in emergency departments and federally qualified health centers and found the program was effective in reducing risky substance abuse; and Whereas, Bringing SBIRT into the school setting holds great potential for curbing substance use among young people and preventing addiction before it begins;
