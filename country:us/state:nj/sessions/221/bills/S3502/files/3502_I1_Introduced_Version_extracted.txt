Whether a participant has made good faith efforts shall be determined by the State agency in consultation with the chief.  For purposes of determining whether a prime contractor has made a good faith effort to comply with the sub-contracting requirements of this section, the State agency shall consider: a.     whether the contractor has advertised the opportunity to, or otherwise made qualified business enterprises aware of the opportunity and, in such event, (1) whether qualified business enterprises exhibited interest in working with the prime contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency awarding the contract; and (2) whether qualified business enterprises, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage qualified business enterprises prior to the State agencys bid date; b.    whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities for the contract to appropriate qualified business enterprises that appear in the States central certification registry which lists businesses certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State program; c.     whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by qualified business enterprises; and d.    any other actions  as determined appropriate by the chief, and established by rules adopted pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 5.    a.  State contracts awarded pursuant to this act,  P.L.    , c.  (C      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be subject to the same safeguards, protections, and processes established by law, rule, or regulation and applicable to all other State contracts, except to the extent inconsistent with this act. b.    A State agency may raise vendor performance issues in the same manner as vendor performance issues are raised for non-sheltered market program contracts, except that the State agency shall also notify the chief of any vendor performance issues. 6.    Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the State Treasurer shall adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such rules and regulations as the State Treasurer deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.           , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which rules and regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 180 days after the date of the filing.  Prior to the expiration of the rules and regulations, the department shall amend, adopt, or readopt the rules and regulations in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 7.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to contracts awarded on and after the 181st day next following the effective date. STATEMENT This bill establishes a sheltered market program that allows for State agencies, with the approval of the Chief Diversity Officer, to designate certain public contracts for availability to contractors who have been certified by the Department of the Treasury.  This program will be available to contractors who are certified as a disabled veterans business, minority business, womens business, small business, economically or socially disadvantaged business, LGTBQ+-owned business, or veteran-owned business. The bill directs the Chief Diversity Officer to establish criteria for determining which contracts should be designated for this program, including the degree of historical underutilization of qualified business enterprises based on a review of qualified business enterprises in the States central certification registry or a State-commissioned disparity study.  State agencies will be permitted to object to the designation of certain contracts for the program if they determine such designation would be contrary to an important State public policy, the practical limitations of the agency or contract, or an applicable legal order. The bill also requires that State agencies publish all contracts or categories of contracts approved for the sheltered market program on their respective websites prior to opening such contracts for bidding, and the chief publishes such contracts on the departments website. The bill further requires State agencies and the chief to conduct outreach regarding available contracts under the sheltered market program to qualified business enterprises and State agencies to conduct general or pre-bid submission conferences or workshops to help potential bidders understand the bidding process for the sheltered market program.  State agencies will also be required to offer each bidder to a contract designated for the sheltered market program the option to debrief on the process following the award of the contract and conclusion of any challenges to contract awards after the expiration of the time period for challenges to be filed. This bill will require each State agency to submit an annual report to the chief on the implementation of the sheltered market program, including: (1) the number and dollar value of contracts awarded to qualified business enterprises under the sheltered market program; (2) the total number, the percentage, the total dollar value, and the percentage dollar value of contracts awarded by State agencies to qualified business enterprises eligible for participation in the sheltered market program; (3) recommendations for continuing, modifying, or terminating the sheltered market program; and (4) a description of efforts undertaken to increase contracting with qualified business enterprises. The bill provides that a State contract will not be awarded under the sheltered market program for a term to exceed three years, and that each contract will include termination for cause and termination for convenience clauses, consistent with the State agencys standard terms and conditions. Finally, the bill requires that prime contractors awarded contracts under the terms of the bill make a good faith effort to offer subcontracting opportunities to qualified business enterprises. The bill provides that failure on the part of a contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be cause for the rejection of bids made by that contractor.  In determining whether a good faith effort has been made, the State agency and the chief will consider whether the contractor has advertised the opportunity to qualified business enterprises and (1) whether qualified business enterprises exhibited interest in working with the prime contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency awarding the contract; and (2) whether qualified business enterprises, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage qualified business enterprises prior to the State agencys bid date.  The chief and the State agency will also consider whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities to qualified business enterprises that appear in the States central certification registry and whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by qualified business enterprises.
