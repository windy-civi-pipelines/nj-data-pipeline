(cf: P.L.2019, c.42, s.20) 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the circumstances under which municipal electric utilities rates are subject to the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities (BPU).  Under current law, the rates of a municipal electric utility that supplies power to customers beyond its corporate limits are subject to the jurisdiction of the BPU.  The bill would modify this by limiting BPU rate-jurisdiction to municipal electric utilities that service more than 10,000 billed customers outside of the supplying municipality.  Further, municipal electric utilities would not be subject to BPU rate regulation if the utility charges customers the same rates, regardless of whether the customer is located inside or outside of the supplying municipality.
