(2) To fix the fee, not exceeding $5, for such license, and to use the fees so collected in supervising and maintaining said privies or other places and in removing and disposing of the excrement therefrom.

(2) Any children's home, orphan asylum, or children's aid society incorporated under the laws of this State. (3) Any aid society of a properly organized and accredited church or fraternal society organized for aid and relief to its members. (4) Any charitable society incorporated under the laws of this State having as one of its objects the prevention of cruelty to children or the care and protection of children. m.   (1) To require in buildings, designed to be occupied, or occupied, as residences by more than two families and when the owners have agreed to supply heat, that from October 1 of each year to the next succeeding May 1, every unit of dwelling space and every habitable room therein shall be maintained at least at 68 degrees F. [whenever the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees during daytime hours] from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., and at 65 degrees F. from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.  At times other than those specified interiors of units of dwelling space shall be maintained at least at 55 degrees F. whenever the outside temperature falls below 40 degrees. (2)   To require in any "housing for older persons," as defined in section 807(b)(2) of the federal "Fair Housing Act," 42 U.S.C. s.3607, except a nursing facility that is in compliance with comfortable and safe temperature standards established pursuant to 42 C.F.R.483.15(h)(6), and in any "community residence for the developmentally disabled," "community residence for the mentally ill," and "community residence for persons with head injuries," as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2), that, if the owner has agreed to supply heat, then from October 1 of each year to the next succeeding May 1, every unit of dwelling space and every habitable room therein shall be maintained at least at 70 degrees F. at all times, unless the room is part of a dwelling unit occupied exclusively by someone who is neither 62 years of age or older, nor has a disability. (3) In meeting the [aforesaid] standards of this subsection, the owner shall not be responsible for heat loss and the consequent drop in the interior temperature arising out of action by the occupants in leaving windows or doors open to the exterior of the building. The owner shall be obligated to supply required fuel or energy and maintain the heating system in good operating condition so that it can supply heat as required herein notwithstanding any contractual provision seeking to delegate or shift responsibility to the occupant or third person, except that the owner shall not be required to supply fuel or energy for heating purposes to any unit where the occupant thereof agrees in writing to supply heat to his own unit of dwelling space and the said unit is served by its own exclusive heating equipment for which the source of heat can be separately computed and billed. n.    To regulate the practice of midwifery, but the exercise of such authority shall not conflict with the provisions of chapter 10 of Title 45 of the Revised Statutes (R.S.45:10-1 et seq.). o.    To enforce the making of returns or reports to the local board on the part of any person charged with such duty under any law and to take cognizance of any failure to make such returns and deal with the same in an effective manner. p.    To act as the agent for a landlord in the engaging of repairmen and the ordering of any parts necessary to restore to operating condition the furnace, boiler or other equipment essential to the proper heating of any residential unit rented by said landlord, provided, however, that at least 24 hours have elapsed since the tenant has lodged a complaint with the local board of health, prior to which a bona fide attempt has been made by the tenant to notify the landlord of the failure of the heating equipment, and the landlord has failed to take appropriate action, and the outside air temperature is less than 55 degrees F. Any person who supplies material or services in accordance with this section shall bill the landlord directly and by filing a notice approved by the local board of health, with the county clerk, shall have a lien on the premises where the materials were used or services supplied. (cf: P.L.2006, c.47, s.110) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows local health boards to require a minimum temperature of 70 degrees from October 1 until May 1 within the habitable rooms of the dwelling units in certain buildings occupied by seniors and disabled persons. Specifically, this bill only applies to "housing for older persons," as defined in section 807(b)(2) of the federal "Fair Housing Act," 42 U.S.C. s.3607, except for nursing facilities, and to any "community residence for the developmentally disabled," "community residence for the mentally ill," and "community residence for persons with head injuries," as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c.448 (C.30:11B-2).  Within those buildings, the bill does not apply to rooms that are part of dwelling units occupied exclusively by persons who are neither 62 years of age or older, nor have a disability. Currently, all multiple dwellings are statutorily required to maintain a temperature of 65 degrees during daytime hours from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., and 65 degrees from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. whenever the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees.  This bill eliminates the restriction that this temperature requirement may only apply when the outside temperature falls below 55 degrees.
