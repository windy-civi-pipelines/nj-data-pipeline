(i)    The odor of marijuana or hashish, or burnt marijuana or hashish, shall not constitute reasonable articulable suspicion to initiate a search of a person to determine a violation of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (12) of this subsection.  A person who violates this subparagraph shall not be subject to arrest, detention, or otherwise be taken into custody, unless the person is being arrested, detained, or otherwise taken into custody for also committing another violation of law for which that action is legally permitted or required; (ii)   A person shall not be deprived of any legal or civil right, privilege, benefit, or opportunity provided pursuant to any law solely by reason of committing a violation of subparagraph (b) of paragraph (12) of this subsection, nor shall committing one or more violations modify any legal or civil right, privilege, benefit, or opportunity provided pursuant to any law, including, but not limited to, the granting, renewal, forfeiture, or denial of a license, permit, or certification, qualification for and the receipt, alteration, continuation, or denial of any form of financial assistance, housing assistance, or other social services, rights of or custody by a biological parent, or adoptive or foster parent, or other legal guardian of a child or newborn infant, or pregnant woman, in any action or proceeding by the Division of Child Protection and Permanency in the Department of Children and Families, or qualification, approval, or disapproval to serve as a foster parent or other legal guardian;

(13) Any other controlled dangerous substance classified in Schedule I, II, III or IV, or its analog, is guilty of a crime of the third degree, except that, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, a fine of up to $25,000 may be imposed;

(cf: P.L.2021, c.19, s.1) 2. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill upgrades the degree of crime associated with the manufacturing, distributing or dispensing of Schedule I or II drugs. It is the sponsors intent to establish penalties for fentanyl-related drug crimes that are more equivalent to the current penalties for heroin.  Currently, fentanyl, despite being more potent and dangerous than heroin, is subject to lighter penalties.  It is the sponsors intent to address the disparities in penalties between the two drugs in order to reduce the incentive to exploit fentanyls potency and profitability and reduce the risk posed by fentanyl to the citizens of this State. Under current law, it is a second degree crime to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a substance classified as a narcotic drug in Schedule I or II, in any quantity of one ounce or more.  It is a crime of the third degree to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a Schedule I or II drug in a quantity of less than one ounce. Under the bill, it is a crime of the first degree to manufacture, distribute, or dispense a Schedule I or II drug in a quantity of one ounce or more; a second degree crime if the quantity is one-half ounce or more, but less than one ounce; and a third degree crime for less than one-half ounce. A first degree crime is ordinarily punishable by 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  A second degree crime is ordinarily punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.  A third degree crime is ordinarily punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. Under the bill, a person who commits the first degree crime of manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing a Schedule I or II drug may instead face a fine of up to $500,000.  Further, a person who commits the third degree crime may instead face a fine of up $75,000.
