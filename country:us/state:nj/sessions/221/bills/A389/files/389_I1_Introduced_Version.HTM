(cf: P.L.2016, c.74, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes that the background investigation of an applicant for a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a handgun is to take precedence over the investigation of other applicants if a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. To implement this provision, the bill also requires the standard application form for an identification card or permit to set forth whether a restraining order obtained by the applicant against a domestic violence offender pursuant to the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act of 1991 is in effect. The intent of the bill is to expedite the process of obtaining identification cards or permits for victims of domestic violence so they are better able to protect themselves from their attackers.
