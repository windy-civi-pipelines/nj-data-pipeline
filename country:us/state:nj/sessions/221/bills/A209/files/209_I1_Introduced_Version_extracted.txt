Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.1983, c.283 (C.27:7-44.9) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a. In addition to other powers conferred upon the Commissioner of Transportation by any other law and not in limitation thereof, the commissioner, in connection with the construction, reconstruction,

located in, on, along, over or under any [highway] infrastructure project shall be relocated in the project or should be removed from the project, the [public] utility [or cable television] company owning or operating the facilities shall relocate or remove the same in accordance with the order of the commissioner.  The cost and expenses of such relocation or removal, including the cost of installing the facilities in a new location, or new locations, and the cost of any lands, or any rights or interests in lands, and any other rights acquired to accomplish the relocation or removal,

construction, reconstruction, repair, resurfacing, and rehabilitation of highways and the planning, acquisition, engineering, construction, reconstruction, repair, maintenance, and rehabilitation of public transportation projects or other transportation projects which the department may be authorized by law to undertake. Impact cost means any direct or indirect cost resulting from any action or inaction by a utility company required by this section that prevents the department, a contractor, or both from timely proceeding with the construction and completion of an infrastructure project. Infrastructure project means any highway project, public transportation project, transportation project, or the construction, reconstruction, alteration, addition, physical betterment, or

(3)   If, upon final notice from the department, a utility company is advised that it will delay or prevent the department from proceeding with the design of the infrastructure project by a failure to provide necessary information or failure to respond to the department in a timely manner, a utility company shall be liable to the department for impact costs incurred as a result of the infrastructure project design delays. e.     Based on the information provided pursuant to subsection d. of this section, the department shall prepare, in consultation with all utility companies within the project area, a final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan.  Engineering design and review costs incurred by a utility company, in support of the development of the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan, shall be paid by the utility company. f.     (1)  The department shall provide all utility companies within the project area a copy of the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan.  Responsibility for the relocation or accommodation of facilities  in the project area shall be assigned by the department, at its discretion, and identified in the final infrastructure project work plan. (2)   Within 30 days of receipt of the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan, a utility company within the project area shall provide the department acknowledgement of assignment of responsibility for the relocation or accommodation of their facility, as well as verification of acceptance of the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan.  Failure to provide such acknowledgement and verification within the given timeframe shall be considered to delay or interfere with the project work plan and the utility company shall be liable to the department for any impact costs incurred by the department as a result of these delays. g.    A utility company shall be responsible for any work it performs in accordance with the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan. A utility company shall be liable to the department for any impact costs incurred by the department as a result of the failure of the utility company to complete the accommodation work in accordance with the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan. A utility company shall be liable to the contractor for any impact costs incurred by the contractor as a result of the failure of a utility company to complete the accommodation work in accordance with the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan.  The department shall not be liable to the contractor for any impact costs incurred by the contractor as a result of the failure of a utility company to complete the accommodation work in accordance with the final infrastructure project work plan and construction schedule and the utility accommodation plan. h.    If the department determines that a utility company provided incorrect information regarding the location or type of its facilities, a utility company shall be liable to the department and the contractor for any impact costs incurred by the contractor as a result of the delays associated with the incorrect information.  The department shall not be liable to the contractor for any impact costs incurred by the contractor as a result of this delay. i.     The powers conferred upon the commissioner by this section also are conferred upon the governing body of any county having under its jurisdiction a limited access highway in the meaning of section 1 of P.L.1945, c.83 (C.27:7A-1) with respect to the construction, reconstruction, maintenance or operation of any highway project on that limited access highway. (cf: P.L.1989, c.32, s.12) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month after enactment and shall apply to projects that are, or scheduled to be, bid 180 days after the effective date of this act, but shall not apply to projects for which engineering or construction agreements have been executed between the department and a utility company as of the effective date of this act. STATEMENT This bill expands the current requirement that a public utility or a cable television company (collectively, utility company) accommodate and relocate facilities when necessary for transportation infrastructure projects, at the direction of the Department of Transportation (department). The bill defines facilities as a utility companys tracks, pipes, mains or laterals, conduits, access manholes or chambers, cables, wires, towers, poles, telecommunications equipment, data transmissions systems, or other equipment, appliances, or apparatus, but not including any railroad. The bill creates a process whereby the department and a utility company establish and assign responsibility for the relocation of utility facilities within the limits of construction projects.  The bill permits the department to manage utility relocations through its construction contract, and allows the departments contractor to control the projects construction schedule and the timing for utility facilities relocation work.  Where appropriate, the department may assign responsibility for the utility relocation to a utility company. The bills provisions allow the department to hold a utility company liable for delaying the department or its contractor for failure to provide necessary data and support during the design process, or failure to relocate their facilities according to the construction schedule when the utility company accepts responsibility for relocating their facilities. The bill maintains current practice by not requiring the utility company to pay relocation costs, but does require the utility company to pay for costs associated with pre-engineering, field location testing, engineering design and review, and any costs attributable to the utility company from its delay in the relocation of its facilities. Delays in relocating utility facilities typically delay other construction activities that are dependent on their relocation, thereby affecting the overall construction schedule. Construction delays can increase material costs, which can increase over time, and labor costs as personnel must be retained on a construction project for a longer period of time.  Additionally, the general public may be inconvenienced by longer construction periods.  The bill is intended to considerably reduce delays and costs when a utility companys facilities are not relocated in accordance with the construction schedule.
