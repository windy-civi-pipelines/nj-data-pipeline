<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands the current
requirement that a public utility or a cable television company (collectively,
utility company) accommodate and relocate facilities when necessary for
transportation infrastructure projects, at the direction of the Department of
Transportation (department).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines facilities as

telecommunications equipment, data transmissions systems, or other equipment,
appliances, or apparatus, but not including any railroad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates a process
whereby the department and a utility company establish and assign
responsibility for the relocation of utility facilities within the limits of
construction projects.  The bill permits the department to manage utility
relocations through its construction contract, and allows the departments
contractor to control the projects construction schedule and the timing for
utility<u> </u>facilities relocation work.  Where appropriate, the department
may assign responsibility for the utility relocation to a utility company.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bills provisions allow
the department to hold a utility company liable for delaying the department or
its contractor for failure to provide necessary data and support during the
design process, or failure to relocate their facilities according to the
construction schedule when the utility company accepts responsibility for
relocating their facilities.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill maintains current
practice by not requiring the utility company to pay relocation costs, but does
require the utility company to pay for costs associated with pre-engineering,
field location testing, engineering design and review, and any costs
attributable to the utility company from its delay in the relocation of its
facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Delays in relocating utility
facilities typically delay other construction activities that are dependent on
their relocation, thereby affecting the overall construction schedule. 
Construction delays can increase material costs, which can increase over time,
and labor costs as personnel must be retained on a construction project for a
longer period of time.  Additionally, the general public may be inconvenienced
by longer construction periods.  The bill is intended to considerably reduce
delays and costs when a utility companys facilities are not relocated in
accordance with the construction schedule.</p>
