of any registered voter moving to another address within the same election
district; to another election district within the same county; or to another
election district in another county for processing as provided under subsection
c. of this section.  Copies of these notices shall also be available at the
office of the municipal clerk in each municipality.  Each municipal clerk shall
transmit daily to the commissioner all the filled out change of residence
notices that may be in the municipal clerk's office at the time.  These notices
shall be printed upon cards, shall contain a blank form showing where the
applicant last resided and the address and exact location to which the
applicant has moved and shall have a line for the applicant's signature,
printed name and date of birth.  Upon receipt of such change of residence
notice the commissioner shall cause the signature to be compared with the
registration forms of the applicant and, if such signature appears to be of and
by one and the same legal voter, the commissioner shall cause the entry of the
change of residence to be made on those registration forms and the registrant
shall thereupon be qualified to vote in the election district to which the
registrant shall have so moved.  If the commissioner is not satisfied as to the
signature on the request for a change of residence, a confirmation notice as

the county, if such a notice has been sent to the voter, or who has not moved
since the previous election but whose registration information is missing or
otherwise deficient, or has otherwise failed to notify the commissioner of

district board member shall provide the voter with a provisional ballot, and an
envelope with an affirmation statement that conforms with the requirements for
such documents contained in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.1999, c.232

statement, place the ballot in the envelope, seal and return it to the district
board member.  The board member shall review the information in the affirmation
statement for completeness before forwarding it for inspection, tabulation and
notation by the county board of elections, as provided for by sections 7
through 26 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 through C.19:53C-20).  The
affirmation statement shall constitute a transfer to the registrant's new residence
for any subsequent election.  However, if the voter has moved from one
residence to another within the same election district at any time, the voter
shall be permitted to vote in such election district at any election in the

the registrant to the district board member of the registrant's change of

shall file a change of residence notice with the commissioner of either county

State, in order to be permitted to vote.  A change of residence notice filed by
a voter pursuant to this subsection shall cause the commissioners of the county
of previous residence and the county of new residence to update the voter
registration record of that voter.  The commissioner of the county of new
residence shall notify the voter by mail that the voter is now registered to
vote in that county or, if the notice submitted by the voter is incomplete, to
request any additional information or documentation necessary to finalize the
change of residence notice.  Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to
waive the requirement specified under R.S.19:31-5 that the voter shall have
been a resident of the county of new residence for at least 30 days prior to

to vote in any election shall at any time after the opening of the polls be at
liberty to enter the polling place or room and claim his right to vote at such
election in his proper district, and he shall claim such right in person before
the district board in the district. The board shall permit no person to vote
whose name does not appear in the signature copy register of its election district. 
Each voter in claiming the right to vote shall first give his full name and
address to the member of the district board having charge of the duplicate
permanent registration binder and voting record and the signature comparison
record<u>, and shall present a document as valid proof of identification or an
executed affidavit as to a religious objection to being photographed as an
exemption from this requirement in accordance with subsection b. of
R.S.19:15-17</u>.  Such clerk<u>, if after examining the document presented, is
satisfied that it is valid proof of identification or a valid executed
affidavit as to a religious objection to being photographed as an exemption to
the identification requirement,</u> shall thereupon locate the permanent
registration form and voting record and signature comparison record of the
voter and shall require the voter to thereupon sign his name in the proper
space on his signature comparison record if the voter has previously signed his
name on the line marked sample signature.  If the voter has not so signed the
member of the district board shall require the voter to sign the line marked
sample signature and compare the sample signature with the signature made by
such person at the time he registered and if satisfied that they were made by
one and the same person he shall then permit the voter to sign his name in the
proper space on the signature comparison record.  The voter shall sign his name
without assistance using black ink in the proper column on the signature
comparison record.  Such signature being completed on the signature comparison
record the member of the board having charge of the duplicate permanent
registration binder shall audibly and publicly announce the name of the
claimant and if the member of the board has ascertained from the duplicate
permanent registration binder that the claimant is registered as a qualified
voter and upon comparison the member of the board is satisfied that the
signature of the claimant and the sample signature on the signature copy register
has been made by one and the same person, the member of the board who compared
the signature of the voter shall place his initials in the proper column on the
signature comparison record signifying that he has made such comparison and is
satisfied that the signature of the claimant and sample signature has been made
by one and the same person; whereupon the voter shall be eligible to receive a
ballot unless it be shown to the satisfaction of a majority of the members of
the district board that he is not entitled to vote in the district or has
otherwise become disqualified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to signing the
signature comparison record and after the comparison of the signature with the
signature in the register, a person offering to vote at a primary election for
the general election shall announce his name and the party primary in which he
wishes to vote.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After a person has voted, the
member of the district board having charge of the signature copy register shall
place the number of the person's ballot in the proper column on the record of
voting form of such person, which number shall constitute a record that the
person has voted.  In the case of a primary election for the general election
such member of the district board shall also place in the proper column on the
record of voting form the first three letters of the name of the political
party whose primary ballot such person has voted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person shall be required to
sign the signature comparison record as a means of identification if he shall
have been unable to write his name when he registered, or if, having been able
to write his name when registered, he subsequently shall have lost his sight or
lost the hand with which he was accustomed to write or shall by reason of
disease or accident be unable to write his name when he applies to vote, but
each such person who alleges his inability to sign his name on the signature
comparison record shall establish his identity as follows:  one of the members
of the district board shall read the same list of questions to the voter as
were required upon registration, such questions shall be provided at each
election by the commissioner of registration and are to be known as
&quot;identification statements for election day.&quot;  The member of the
board shall write the answers of the voter upon the identification statement. 
These statements shall be inserted in the front of the duplicate registry
binders, at each election, and shall be numbered serially from one to twenty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each statement shall contain
the same questions as the voter was required to answer upon registration.  The
questions answered upon registration shall not be turned to or inspected until
the answers to the questions shall have been written on election day by the
member of the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     At the end of each list of questions
shall be printed the following statement:  &quot;I certify that I have read to

of the board who has made the above record shall sign his name to such
certificate and date the same, and note the time of day of making such record. 
If the answers to the questions asked of the voter on election day agree with
the answers given by him to the same questions at the time he registered, he
shall then be eligible to receive a ballot.  Any person who shall permit or
attempt to furnish the answers on behalf of the voter shall be guilty of a
crime of the fourth degree.  The commissioner of registration shall furnish sufficient
identification statements for each election district in each county.  The
statements shall be printed on sheets approximately ten by sixteen inches and
shall contain a margin of approximately two inches for binding and shall be
inserted in the front of the duplicate registry binders each election and shall

the members of the district board, that by reason of an inability to read or
write, blindness or other physical disability he is unable to mark his ballot
without assistance, shall have the assistance of two members of the board who
shall not be members of the same political party, to be assigned by the board,
in preparing his ballot.  Such members shall retire with such voter to the
booth and assist him in the preparation of his ballot and folding the same. 
The member acting as clerk of the district board shall make an entry on a
disability certificate for assistance, which entry shall be in the form of an
oath and be inserted in the front of the duplicate registry binders each
election.</p>

allowed to assist him in marking his ballot or to witness the marking of the
same.  No member of the board shall reveal the name of any person for whom such
voter has voted or anything that took place while he was being assisted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Such voter, if blind,
disabled, or unable to read or write, may, in lieu of the assistance of the
board as above provided, have assistance of some person of his own selection in
preparing his ballot.  Such person shall retire with such voter to the booth
and assist him in the preparation of his ballot and folding the same.  The name
and address of such person shall be recorded as above.  In such case, no other
person than the one so selected by the voter shall be allowed to assist such
voter in marking his ballot or witness the marking of the same. No person so
selected shall reveal the name of any person for whom such voter has voted or
anything that took place while he was being assisted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The disability certificates

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require voters
to present certain documentation as proof of voter identity to vote, beginning
with the first election held after January 1, 2025.  A voter, whether voting in
person or through mail-in ballot, would be required to show or submit a copy of
a New Jerseys drivers license, New Jersey nondrivers identification card, or
other document, that includes all of the following criteria: (1) the name of
the voter to whom the document was issued; (2) a photograph of the voter to
whom the document was issued; (3) an expiration date, showing that the document
is not expired or expired only after the date of the most recent election; and
(4) was issued by the federal government or this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For first-time voters, this
documentation would be required in addition to the production of any document
necessary to fulfill the proof of identity requirement mandated by the federal
Help America Vote Act of 2002, if that first-time voter had registered to
vote by mail without submitting federally-acceptable identity verification with
the registration.  However, a first-time voter in this situation would be
required to present only one document with respect to both identification
requirements, if that document is able to satisfy the document criteria as
applicable to each requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The requirement for verifying
voter identity through additional documentation would not apply to any voter
entitled to vote by mail-in ballot under the federal Uniformed and Overseas
Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or provided the right to vote otherwise than in
person under the federal Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped
Act, or any other federal law.  Additionally, because the bills verification
of identity requires the production of a document containing a photograph of
the voter, it incorporates an exemption from the production of such document if
the voter has a religious objection to being photographed, and this is
established by a sworn affidavit from the voter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to administer the
bills new voter verification requirement, the bill updates the statutory
provisions governing election day challenges to a persons right to vote by
district board members or other authorized challengers, as appointed pursuant to
Chapter 7 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes.  With respect to any voter who
is denied the right to vote for failing to display acceptable documentation,
that voter would be provided a provisional ballot.  In order for that ballot to
be officially counted in an election, the voter would need to produce the
required documentation by the close of business on the second day after the
election to the applicable county commissioner of registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, to ensure that no one
is denied the right to vote based solely on an inability to pay for a
government-issued document with photograph as required under the bill for
identity verification, the Motor Vehicle Commission would issue a nondriver
identification card without cost to any voter requiring such document upon
execution of an affidavit of indigence. </p>
