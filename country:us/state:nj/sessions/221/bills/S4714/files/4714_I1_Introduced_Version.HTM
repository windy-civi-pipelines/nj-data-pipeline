<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.33:1-10 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     33:1-10.  Class A licenses
shall be subdivided and classified as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Plenary brewery license.  1a. 
The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and regulations,
to brew any malt alcoholic beverages and to sell and distribute his products to
wholesalers and retailers licensed in accordance with this chapter, and to sell
and distribute without this State to any persons pursuant to the laws of the
places of such sale and distribution, and to maintain a warehouse; provided,
however, that the delivery of this product by the holder of this license to
retailers licensed under this title shall be from inventory in a warehouse
located in this State which is operated under a plenary brewery license.  The
fee for this license shall be $10,625.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Limited brewery license.  1b. 
The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and regulations,
to brew any malt alcoholic beverages in a quantity to be expressed in said
license, dependent upon the following fees and not in excess of 300,000 barrels
of 31 fluid gallons capacity per year and to sell and distribute this product
to wholesalers and retailers licensed in accordance with this chapter, and to
sell and distribute without this State to any persons pursuant to the laws of
the places of such sale and distribution, and to maintain a warehouse;
provided, however, that the delivery of this product by the holder of this
license to retailers licensed under this title shall be from inventory in a
warehouse located in this State which is operated under a limited brewery
license.  The holder of this license shall be entitled to sell this product at
retail to consumers on the licensed premises of the brewery for consumption on
the premises, or in a quantity of not more than 15.5 fluid gallons per person
for consumption off the premises, and to offer samples for sampling purposes. 
The holder of this license shall not be required to pay a fee to the division
for the privilege of offering samples pursuant to this section.  If the holder
of this license holds a bonded warehouse bottling license issued pursuant to
subsection 5 of this section, product brewed in accordance with this subsection
and transferred to a bonded warehouse for bottling and storage may be sold at
retail and offered for sampling on the licensed premises of the brewery by the
holder of this license.  The holder of this license shall not sell food or
operate a restaurant on the licensed premises, but may coordinate with food
vendors pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.290 (C.33:1-10b).  The holder of
this license shall be entitled to engage in the privileges established pursuant
to section 1 of P.L.2023, c.290 (C.33:1-10b).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The fee for this license shall
be graduated as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     to so brew not more than
50,000 barrels of 31 liquid gallons capacity per annum, $1,250;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     to so brew not more than

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     to so brew not more than
300,000 barrels of 31 fluid gallons capacity per annum, $7,500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, &quot;sampling&quot; means the selling at a nominal charge or the
gratuitous offering of an open container not exceeding four ounces of any malt
alcoholic beverage.  For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;product&quot;
means any malt alcoholic beverage that is produced on the premises licensed
under this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Restricted brewery license. 
1c.  The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and
regulations, to brew any malt alcoholic beverages in a quantity to be expressed
in such license not in excess of 300,000 barrels of 31 gallons capacity per
year.  Notwithstanding the provisions of R.S.33:1-26, the director shall issue
a restricted brewery license only to a person or an entity which has identical
ownership to an entity which holds a plenary retail consumption license issued
pursuant to R.S.33:1-12, provided that such plenary retail consumption license
is operated in conjunction with a restaurant regularly and principally used for
the purpose of providing meals to its customers and having adequate kitchen and
dining room facilities, and that the licensed restaurant premises is
immediately adjoining the premises licensed under this subsection.  The holder
of this license shall be entitled to sell or deliver the product to that
restaurant premises.  The holder of this license also shall be entitled to sell
and distribute the product to wholesalers and retailers licensed in accordance
with this chapter and to sell and distribute without this State to any persons
pursuant to the laws of those places of such sale and distribution, and to
maintain a warehouse; provided, however, that the delivery of this product by
the holder of this license to retailers licensed under this title shall be from
inventory in a warehouse located in this State which is operated under a restricted
brewery license. The amount of malt alcoholic beverages that may be sold and
distributed directly to retailers pursuant to this subsection on an annual
basis shall be not more than 50 percent of the product manufactured in that
year by the holder of this license.  The fee for this license shall be $1,250,
which fee shall entitle the holder to brew up to 1,000 barrels of 31 liquid
gallons per annum.  The licensee also shall pay an additional $250 for every
additional 1,000 barrels of 31 fluid gallons produced.  The fee shall be paid
at the time of application for the license, and additional payments based on
barrels produced shall be paid within 60 days following the expiration of the
license term upon certification by the licensee of the actual gallons brewed
during the license term.  No more than 10 restricted brewery licenses shall be
issued to a person or entity which holds an interest in a plenary retail
consumption license.  If the governing body of the municipality in which the
licensed premises will be located should file a written objection, the director
shall hold a hearing and may issue the license only if the director finds that
the issuance of the license will not be contrary to the public interest.  All
fees related to the issuance of both licenses shall be paid in accordance with
statutory law.  The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to
limit or restrict the rights and privileges granted by the plenary retail
consumption license held by the holder of the restricted brewery license issued
pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the holder
of a farm brewery license is entitled, subject to rules and regulations, to
brew any malt alcoholic beverages in a quantity to be expressed in the license
not in excess of 2,500 barrels of 31 fluid gallons per year and to sell
products to consumers for consumption off the licensed premises and to offer
samples for sampling purposes only.  This bill allows holders of a farm brewery
license to also sell products to consumers for consumption on the licensed
premises.  </p>
