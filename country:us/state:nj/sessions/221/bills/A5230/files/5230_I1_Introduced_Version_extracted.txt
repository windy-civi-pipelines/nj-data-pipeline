For the purposes of this section, "eligible applicant" means a person submitting to the commission an application for a motor vehicle driver's license, an examination permit, a probationary driver's license, [or] a non-driver identification card, or a license to operate a power vessel who meets all requirements for eligibility to vote under R.S.19:4-1.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.6, s.2) 5. This act shall take effect on January 1 next following the date of enactment, but the Secretary of State may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires the establishment of an automatic voter registration process at an agency, office, or local police force providing certain licenses and permits. The bill requires the automatic voter registration process to be available for persons applying for hunting, fishing, or trapping licenses, all around sportsman licenses, beaver trapping, wild turkey, or deer permits under the Division of Fish and Wildlife in the Department of Environmental Protection, and firearms purchaser identification cards or permits to carry handguns at local police forces or the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety.  The bill requires the respective agencies, offices, and local police forces to establish an automatic voter registration process similar to that currently applicable at the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJMVC).  The bill also adds licenses to operate a power vessel, also known as boating licenses, under the NJMVCs current automatic voter registration process. Under the bill, any agency, office, or local police force that provides the above mentioned licenses and permits, that the Secretary of State verifies already collects documents that would provide proof of eligibility, including age, citizenship, and residence address, would be required to establish and implement, upon approval by the Secretary of State, a procedure for automatically and electronically transmitting voter registration information to the Secretary of State of persons who are eligible to vote for the purpose of registering such persons to vote or updating their voter registration.  Each person from whom voter registration information is collected would be offered an opportunity to decline automatic voter registration.  The bill requires compliance with the automatic voter registration requirements established under current law for the NJMVC, including the provision of required notices to their clients, to the extent applicable as determined by the Secretary of State.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.6, s.2) 5. This act shall take effect on January 1 next following the date of enactment, but the Secretary of State may take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires the establishment of an automatic voter registration process at an agency, office, or local police force providing certain licenses and permits. The bill requires the automatic voter registration process to be available for persons applying for hunting, fishing, or trapping licenses, all around sportsman licenses, beaver trapping, wild turkey, or deer permits under the Division of Fish and Wildlife in the Department of Environmental Protection, and firearms purchaser identification cards or permits to carry handguns at local police forces or the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety.  The bill requires the respective agencies, offices, and local police forces to establish an automatic voter registration process similar to that currently applicable at the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJMVC).  The bill also adds licenses to operate a power vessel, also known as boating licenses, under the NJMVCs current automatic voter registration process. Under the bill, any agency, office, or local police force that provides the above mentioned licenses and permits, that the Secretary of State verifies already collects documents that would provide proof of eligibility, including age, citizenship, and residence address, would be required to establish and implement, upon approval by the Secretary of State, a procedure for automatically and electronically transmitting voter registration information to the Secretary of State of persons who are eligible to vote for the purpose of registering such persons to vote or updating their voter registration.  Each person from whom voter registration information is collected would be offered an opportunity to decline automatic voter registration.  The bill requires compliance with the automatic voter registration requirements established under current law for the NJMVC, including the provision of required notices to their clients, to the extent applicable as determined by the Secretary of State.
