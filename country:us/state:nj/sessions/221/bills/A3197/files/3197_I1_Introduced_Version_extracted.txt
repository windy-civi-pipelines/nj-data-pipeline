Dedicated State funding for these two causes generally ranges from approximately $4 million to $6 million annually.  The NJCCR promotes significant and original research in New Jersey into the causes, prevention, treatment and palliation of cancer and serves as a resource to providers and consumers of cancer care and treatment services. Currently, under statute, the NJCCR annually receives $1.0 million of cigarette and other tobacco products tax revenues.  This money is deposited into an existing lapsing Cancer Research Fund and then appropriated to the commission.  In recent years, pursuant to the annual appropriations act, this money has been transferred from the Cancer Research Fund to the General Fund.  The appropriations act then provides the NJCCR funding via a budget line.  Despite the statutory requirement, in FY 2020 and FY 2021, the NJCCR was appropriated $2.0 million in funding. Under the bill, the existing Cancer Research Fund is replaced by a non-lapsing, revolving fund.  This fund is to be the repository of the $4.0 million of cigarette and other tobacco products tax revenues deposited into the account under the bill and any other funds approved by the Department of Health or the commission.  Moneys deposited in the fund, and any interest earned thereon, are to be used exclusively for the purpose of providing grants for cancer research projects authorized and approved by the commission, as well as any other commission responsibilities authorized under State law. The State Treasurer is the custodian of the fund and all disbursements from the fund are to be made by the State Treasurer upon vouchers signed by the chairperson of the commission or the chairpersons designee.  The monies in the fund are to be invested and reinvested by the Director of the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury in the same manner as other trust funds in the custody of the State Treasurer, in the manner provided by law.  Interest received on the monies in the fund are to be credited to the fund.
