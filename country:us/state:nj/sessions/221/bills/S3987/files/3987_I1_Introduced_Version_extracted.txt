Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. a.  (1)  No person, firm, corporation, partnership, association, limited liability company, or other entity shall sell, offer to sell, or offer for promotional purposes, either directly or indirectly by an agent or employee, any over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building to a minor under 18 years of age, unless the minor is accompanied by a parent or guardian.

Consistent with federal law, the provisions of this subsection shall not apply to an individual performing his or her assigned duties as an employee of the United States Postal Service. (3) The establishment of the following shall constitute a defense to any prosecution brought for a violation of paragraph (2) of this subsection: that the purchaser or recipient of the over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building, or the individual signing for the delivery of the over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building, falsely represented, by producing either a driver's license or non-driver identification card issued by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, a similar card issued pursuant to the laws of another state or the federal government of Canada, or a photographic identification card issued by a county clerk, that the purchaser or recipient was of legal age to make the purchase, sign for the delivery, or receive the delivery. (4) No delivery seller shall place any over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building for delivery to a residence in this State unless the outside of the package, which contains the over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building, clearly indicates that there is an over-the-counter diet pill or a dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building within the package. b.

A penalty recovered under the provisions of this subsection shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality. (2) When determining whether an over-the-counter diet pill or dietary supplement is labeled, marketed, or otherwise represented for the purpose of achieving weight loss or muscle building in a summary proceeding before a municipal court having jurisdiction, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall consider the following factors: (a) whether the product contains: (i) an ingredient approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration for weight loss or muscle building; (ii) a steroid; or (iii) creatine, green tea extract, raspberry ketone, garcinia cambogia, or green coffee bean extract; (b) whether the products labeling or marketing bears statements or images that express or imply that the product will help: (i) modify, maintain, or reduce body weight, fat, appetite, overall metabolism, or the process by which nutrients are metabolized; or (ii) maintain or increase muscle or strength; (c) whether the product or its ingredients are otherwise represented for the purpose of achieving weight loss or building muscle; or (d) whether the retailer has categorized the dietary supplement for weight loss or muscle building by: (i) placing signs, categorizing, or tagging the supplement with statements described in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph; (ii) grouping the supplements with other weight loss or muscle building products in a display, advertisement, webpage, or area of the store; or (iii) otherwise representing that the product is for weight loss or muscle building. c.
