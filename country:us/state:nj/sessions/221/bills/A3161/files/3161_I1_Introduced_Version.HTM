Eligibility for the civil service benefits for all veterans is contingent upon voter approval of an authorizing amendment to the State Constitution.

(cf:  P.L.2016, c.26, s.1) 12.  (New section) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, a resident of this State who is in federal active service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve component thereof, and has not been discharged or released therefrom, but who otherwise qualifies as a veteran, shall be eligible for a civil service preference on the same basis as a veteran.  Instead of the certificate of honorable discharge or release under honorable circumstances required to be provided to the Adjutant General of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs pursuant to N.J.S.11A:5-1, the applicant shall provide to the Adjutant General, in a form and content the Adjutant General shall deem appropriate, evidence of status in federal active service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States or a Reserve component thereof and evidence of subsequent discharge therefrom no later than eight days prior to the issuance of an employment list for which that individual received a passing score. 13.  N.J.S.11A:5-13 and section 3 of P.L.2001, c.128 (C.43:15A-24b) are repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately, except that section 1 shall take effect on the 1st day of the calendar year following approval by the voters of an authorizing amendment to Article VII, Section I, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of the State of New Jersey. STATEMENT This bill broadens the eligibility for certain veterans' benefits by eliminating the requirement that a veteran serve during specific wars or other periods of emergency, and, in certain instances, that a veteran serve in a war zone.  Instead of service during specific dates or in specific locations, the bill requires federal active service in any branch of the United States Armed Forces or a Reserve component thereof. The benefits in the bill are (1) a civil service preference under Title 11A of the New Jersey Statutes; (2) a veteran's retirement allowance under the Teachers' Pension and Annuity Fund (TPAF) or the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS); and (3) the purchase of additional military service credit in the Police and Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS), TPAF, PERS, and the State Police Retirement System (SPRS). Eligibility for the civil service benefits for all veterans is contingent upon voter approval of an authorizing amendment to the State Constitution.
