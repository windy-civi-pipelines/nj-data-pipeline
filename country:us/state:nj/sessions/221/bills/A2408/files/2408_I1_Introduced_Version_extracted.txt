The certified school nurse in consultation with the board of education shall recruit and train volunteer designees who are determined acceptable candidates by the school nurse as deemed necessary by the nursing service plan. 6.    (New section)  The Department of Education shall take appropriate action to ensure that each school district incorporates age-appropriate education on epilepsy and seizure disorders, consistent with the classroom education programs developed by the Epilepsy Foundation of America or any successor organization, for students at least once between kindergarten and third grade and at least once between grades six and 12. 7.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment, except that the Department of Education may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act, including the development of training protocols for the administration of nasal seizure rescue medication and the use of manual vagus nerve stimulators by school employees designated by the certified school nurse. STATEMENT This bill requires a board of education to develop a policy in accordance with the guidelines established by the Department of Education for the emergency administration of nasal seizure rescue medication and the emergency use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator on a student with a seizure disorder.  Pursuant to the policy, the school nurse is to have the primary responsibility for the administration of nasal seizure rescue medication.  The certified school nurse is required to designate at least two additional employees of the school district who volunteer to administer the nasal seizure rescue medication and use a manual vagus nerve stimulator on a student when the school nurse is not physically present at the scene. The certified school nurse is required to determine that: · the designees have been properly trained; · the parents of the student consent in writing to the administration of the nasal seizure rescue medication and use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator by the designees; · the parents are informed in writing that the district and its employees have no liability as a result of any injury arising from the administration of the nasal seizure rescue medication and the use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator; and · the parents sign a statement acknowledging their understanding that the district has no liability as a result of any injury arising from the administration of the nasal seizure rescue medication and the use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator. The policy developed by the school district is to require: (1) the transportation of the student to a hospital emergency room by emergency services personnel after the administration of the nasal seizure rescue medication, and if indicated in the emergency action plan after the use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator.  The student is to be evaluated and receive medical clearance in order to return to school; (2)  an alternative plan in the case that a students seizure action plan does not permit the administration of nasal seizure rescue medication or the use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator by a designee; and (3)  the parent to provide an ample supply of the prescribed nasal seizure rescue medication to the school nurse and to the designees.  Alternatively, if provided for in the seizure action plan, the nasal seizure rescue medication may be permitted to be carried on the students person. The Department of Education, in consultation with the Department of Health, appropriate medical experts, and professional organizations representing school nurses, principals, and teachers, is required to establish and disseminate to each board of education guidelines for the development of a policy by a school district for the emergency administration of nasal seizure rescue medication and the use of a manual vagus nerve stimulator on students.  The Departments of Education and Health are also required to jointly develop protocols, in consultation with the New Jersey State School Nurses Association, for the training of additional school employees as volunteer designees to administer the nasal seizure rescue medication and use a manual vagus nerve stimulator when the school nurse is not physically present. The bill requires the Department of Education to take appropriate action to ensure that each school district incorporates age-appropriate education on epilepsy and seizure disorders, consistent with the classroom education programs developed by the Epilepsy Foundation of America, at least once between kindergarten and third grade and at least once between grades six and 12. The bill will take effect on the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment, except that the Department of Education may take anticipatory administrative action to implement the bills provisions.  This delayed effective date will allow time for the development of training protocols for school employees designated by the certified school nurse to administer the nasal seizure rescue medication or use the manual vagus nerve stimulator when the school nurse is not present.
