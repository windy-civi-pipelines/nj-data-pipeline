<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  New Jerseys high property
taxes continue to make it difficult for homeowners and renters to live in the
State, as high property taxes increase the cost of homeownership and the cost
of monthly rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Changes in the housing
market, including high mortgage interest rates and a lack of affordable
housing, have a deleterious impact on homeowners and renters, including
disabled veteran homeowners and renters, many of whom can no longer afford to
buy a home or find an affordable rental unit in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  In this State,
approximately 73 percent of veterans identify as having a disability, and this

the provisions of section 6 of P.L.1990, c.61 (C.54:4-8.62) and section 3 of
P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.70) concerning the form and deadline of applications
for the ANCHOR rebate program <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b><u>,</u> the
homestead property tax reimbursement, <u>and the disabled veterans property

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) To the extent practicable,
the single combined application shall resemble the form and manner of the
application for the homestead property tax reimbursement program, as created
pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.70), except that the single
combined application form shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to submit
information about his or her age, annual income, including the amount of Social
Security payments received by the applicant, homestead property address, as
well as any other information determined necessary by the director in order to
approve or disapprove the applicant's participation in those programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The combined application
form shall also advise the applicant that the director shall determine the
eligibility of an applicant to receive an ANCHOR rebate, a homestead property
tax reimbursement, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>or<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> a Stay NJ

property tax credit, <u>or a disabled veterans property tax rebate,</u> or any
combination thereof, made in accordance with the procedures established in the
case of applications timely filed, except the date for the payment may be
delayed for a reasonable period.  If an applicant or an applicant's spouse has
filed an application for an extension of time to file a gross income tax
return, the date by which the applicant shall file an application may, in the
discretion of the director, be extended for a reasonable period, and the date
for the payment of an ANCHOR rebate, homestead property tax reimbursement, <b><span

seeking property tax benefits under any of those programs shall accurately
complete the entire application and file it with the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) For purposes of this
subsection, in order to establish good cause to extend the time of an eligible
claimant to file an application, the eligible claimant shall provide to the
director either medical evidence, such as a doctor's certification, that the
claimant was unable to file the claim by the date prescribed by the director
because of illness or hospitalization, or evidence that the applicant attempted
to file a timely application.  Except as may be established by medical evidence
or inability to file a claim, good cause shall not be established due to a
claimant not having received an application from the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Upon the approval of
applications by the director, the director shall prepare lists of individuals
entitled to receive a Stay NJ property tax credit, together with the respective
amounts due each eligible claimant and shall forward such lists to the State
Treasurer, the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, and any other
officials as the director deems appropriate on or before the earliest of such
date or dates as may be convenient for the director to compile such lists.  The
director may inspect all records in the office of the tax collector and tax
assessor of a municipality with respect to applications, claims, and allowances
for Stay NJ property tax credits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If an application
contains a claim for a Stay NJ property tax credit that contains incorrect
information from the claimant or is based upon incorrect or insufficient information
from which the director is to determine and approve the claim, the director may
determine the eligibility of the claimant for a Stay NJ property tax credit and
the correct amount of a Stay NJ property tax credit from such other information
as may be available to the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In the case of an
eligible claimant whose homestead is a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing
corporation, or continuing care retirement community, the director may provide
that the application shall include the name and address of the location of the
property and the amount of real property taxes attributed to the cooperative,
mutual housing residential unit, or continuing care retirement community
residential unit, as shall be indicated in an official notice which shall be
furnished by the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care
retirement community for the tax year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.  The tax collector of
each municipality shall, on or before April 1 of each year, furnish the
director with a list of property taxpayers in the district who are delinquent
for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of
such delinquencies.  The collector shall report on such list the name, lot and
block number on the property tax duplicate as may be applicable, and the
address of each owner to whom a delinquency is attributable together with the
amount of such delinquency so identified.  No rebate payment under P.L.    ,
c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be made
to a property owner while that property owner's delinquency remains; provided,
however, that for the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before
the Legislature as this bill), for an assessment on a property which is on appeal
and for which the statutory percentage of the tax as provided in R.S.54:3-27

delinquent. </p>

the list as provided for in subsection a. of this section, and the director
determines that a property tax delinquency remains for the preceding tax year
on April 1, the director shall ascertain the amount of the rebate required to
be withheld because of such delinquency in each municipality in the State, and
shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer as soon thereafter as may be
practicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     On or before November
15, the director shall notify each rebate claimant whose rebate has been
withheld because of delinquency that the amount of the rebate to which the
claimant otherwise would have been entitled has been sent to the tax collector
in the municipality to be credited against the claimant's delinquency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Upon certification by
the director as to the amount of rebates required to be withheld because of
delinquency in the several municipalities, the State Treasurer, upon the
warrant of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall pay
such amount on or before October 30 to the tax collector in each municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The tax collector in
each municipality shall credit the tax delinquency of each property taxpayer
who appears on the delinquency list set forth in subsection a. of this section
in the amount that otherwise would have been returned to the property taxpayer
as a rebate.  In the event that the amount so credited by the tax collector
exceeds the amount of delinquency, the tax collector may return the difference
to the taxpayer or credit such amount to the subsequent property tax bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In the case of
delinquency in the payment of property taxes by a cooperative, mutual housing
corporation, or continuing care retirement community, a rebate that may be due
an individual resident shall be paid by the State Treasurer to the tax
collector of the municipality.  The tax collector shall credit the cooperative,
mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community with such
payment and the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care
retirement community shall, in turn, credit the individual unit owner to the
extent of the rebate and notify the applicant of the amount to be credited.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    If a tax collector fails
to comply with the provisions of subsection a. of this section requiring the
tax collector to furnish the director with a list, on or before April 1 of each
year, of property taxpayers in the district delinquent for taxes due and
payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such
delinquencies, the director shall pay the rebate directly to the delinquent
applicant rather than to the tax collector of the municipality as set forth in
subsection d. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.  The Director of the
