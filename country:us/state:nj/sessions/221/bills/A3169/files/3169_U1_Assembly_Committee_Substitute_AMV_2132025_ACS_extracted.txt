(cf:  P.L.2024, c.88, s.5) 8.    a.  The tax collector of each municipality shall, on or before April 1 of each year, furnish the director with a list of property taxpayers in the district who are delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies.  The collector shall report on such list the name, lot and block number on the property tax duplicate as may be applicable, and the address of each owner to whom a delinquency is attributable together with the amount of such delinquency so identified.  No rebate payment under P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be made to a property owner while that property owner's delinquency remains; provided, however, that for the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for an assessment on a property which is on appeal and for which the statutory percentage of the tax as provided in R.S.54:3-27 has been paid, the taxes assessed on that property shall not be regarded as delinquent. b.    If the director receives the list as provided for in subsection a. of this section, and the director determines that a property tax delinquency remains for the preceding tax year on April 1, the director shall ascertain the amount of the rebate required to be withheld because of such delinquency in each municipality in the State, and shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer as soon thereafter as may be practicable. c.     On or before November 15, the director shall notify each rebate claimant whose rebate has been withheld because of delinquency that the amount of the rebate to which the claimant otherwise would have been entitled has been sent to the tax collector in the municipality to be credited against the claimant's delinquency. d.    Upon certification by the director as to the amount of rebates required to be withheld because of delinquency in the several municipalities, the State Treasurer, upon the warrant of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall pay such amount on or before October 30 to the tax collector in each municipality. e.     The tax collector in each municipality shall credit the tax delinquency of each property taxpayer who appears on the delinquency list set forth in subsection a. of this section in the amount that otherwise would have been returned to the property taxpayer as a rebate.  In the event that the amount so credited by the tax collector exceeds the amount of delinquency, the tax collector may return the difference to the taxpayer or credit such amount to the subsequent property tax bill. f.     In the case of delinquency in the payment of property taxes by a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, a rebate that may be due an individual resident shall be paid by the State Treasurer to the tax collector of the municipality.  The tax collector shall credit the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community with such payment and the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community shall, in turn, credit the individual unit owner to the extent of the rebate and notify the applicant of the amount to be credited. g.    If a tax collector fails to comply with the provisions of subsection a. of this section requiring the tax collector to furnish the director with a list, on or before April 1 of each year, of property taxpayers in the district delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies, the director shall pay the rebate directly to the delinquent applicant rather than to the tax collector of the municipality as set forth in subsection d. of this section. 9.  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and to prescribe forms to administer the provisions of this act.  Notwithstanding any provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 to the contrary, the director may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such regulations as the director deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the filing. Such regulations may thereafter be amended, adopted or readopted by the director as the director deems necessary in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410. 10.  Nothing in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be interpreted to deny a disabled veteran from receiving any credit, rebate, or deduction guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately.

(2) To the extent practicable, the single combined application shall resemble the form and manner of the application for the homestead property tax reimbursement program, as created pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1997, c.348 (C.54:4-8.70), except that the single combined application form shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to submit information about his or her age, annual income, including the amount of Social Security payments received by the applicant, homestead property address, as well as any other information determined necessary by the director in order to approve or disapprove the applicant's participation in those programs. (3) The combined application form shall also advise the applicant that the director shall determine the eligibility of an applicant to receive an ANCHOR rebate, a homestead property tax reimbursement, [or] a Stay NJ property tax credit, or a disabled veterans property tax rebate, or any combination thereof.  The director shall, for good cause shown, extend the time of any applicant to file an application for a reasonable period, and in such case, the application shall be processed and payment of an ANCHOR rebate, homestead property tax reimbursement, [or] a Stay NJ property tax credit, or a disabled veterans property tax rebate, or any combination thereof, made in accordance with the procedures established in the case of applications timely filed, except the date for the payment may be delayed for a reasonable period.  If an applicant or an applicant's spouse has filed an application for an extension of time to file a gross income tax return, the date by which the applicant shall file an application may, in the discretion of the director, be extended for a reasonable period, and the date for the payment of an ANCHOR rebate, homestead property tax reimbursement, [or] a Stay NJ property tax credit, or a disabled veterans property tax rebate, or any combination thereof, may be delayed for a reasonable period.  A State resident seeking property tax benefits under any of those programs shall accurately complete the entire application and file it with the director. (4) For purposes of this subsection, in order to establish good cause to extend the time of an eligible claimant to file an application, the eligible claimant shall provide to the director either medical evidence, such as a doctor's certification, that the claimant was unable to file the claim by the date prescribed by the director because of illness or hospitalization, or evidence that the applicant attempted to file a timely application.  Except as may be established by medical evidence or inability to file a claim, good cause shall not be established due to a claimant not having received an application from the director. b.    Upon the approval of applications by the director, the director shall prepare lists of individuals entitled to receive a Stay NJ property tax credit, together with the respective amounts due each eligible claimant and shall forward such lists to the State Treasurer, the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, and any other officials as the director deems appropriate on or before the earliest of such date or dates as may be convenient for the director to compile such lists.  The director may inspect all records in the office of the tax collector and tax assessor of a municipality with respect to applications, claims, and allowances for Stay NJ property tax credits. c.     If an application contains a claim for a Stay NJ property tax credit that contains incorrect information from the claimant or is based upon incorrect or insufficient information from which the director is to determine and approve the claim, the director may determine the eligibility of the claimant for a Stay NJ property tax credit and the correct amount of a Stay NJ property tax credit from such other information as may be available to the director. d.    In the case of an eligible claimant whose homestead is a unit in a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, the director may provide that the application shall include the name and address of the location of the property and the amount of real property taxes attributed to the cooperative, mutual housing residential unit, or continuing care retirement community residential unit, as shall be indicated in an official notice which shall be furnished by the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community for the tax year. (cf:  P.L.2024, c.88, s.5) 8.    a.  The tax collector of each municipality shall, on or before April 1 of each year, furnish the director with a list of property taxpayers in the district who are delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies.  The collector shall report on such list the name, lot and block number on the property tax duplicate as may be applicable, and the address of each owner to whom a delinquency is attributable together with the amount of such delinquency so identified.  No rebate payment under P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be made to a property owner while that property owner's delinquency remains; provided, however, that for the purposes of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for an assessment on a property which is on appeal and for which the statutory percentage of the tax as provided in R.S.54:3-27 has been paid, the taxes assessed on that property shall not be regarded as delinquent. b.    If the director receives the list as provided for in subsection a. of this section, and the director determines that a property tax delinquency remains for the preceding tax year on April 1, the director shall ascertain the amount of the rebate required to be withheld because of such delinquency in each municipality in the State, and shall certify such amounts to the State Treasurer as soon thereafter as may be practicable. c.     On or before November 15, the director shall notify each rebate claimant whose rebate has been withheld because of delinquency that the amount of the rebate to which the claimant otherwise would have been entitled has been sent to the tax collector in the municipality to be credited against the claimant's delinquency. d.    Upon certification by the director as to the amount of rebates required to be withheld because of delinquency in the several municipalities, the State Treasurer, upon the warrant of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, shall pay such amount on or before October 30 to the tax collector in each municipality. e.     The tax collector in each municipality shall credit the tax delinquency of each property taxpayer who appears on the delinquency list set forth in subsection a. of this section in the amount that otherwise would have been returned to the property taxpayer as a rebate.  In the event that the amount so credited by the tax collector exceeds the amount of delinquency, the tax collector may return the difference to the taxpayer or credit such amount to the subsequent property tax bill. f.     In the case of delinquency in the payment of property taxes by a cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community, a rebate that may be due an individual resident shall be paid by the State Treasurer to the tax collector of the municipality.  The tax collector shall credit the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community with such payment and the cooperative, mutual housing corporation, or continuing care retirement community shall, in turn, credit the individual unit owner to the extent of the rebate and notify the applicant of the amount to be credited. g.    If a tax collector fails to comply with the provisions of subsection a. of this section requiring the tax collector to furnish the director with a list, on or before April 1 of each year, of property taxpayers in the district delinquent for taxes due and payable for the year immediately preceding and the amounts of such delinquencies, the director shall pay the rebate directly to the delinquent applicant rather than to the tax collector of the municipality as set forth in subsection d. of this section. 9.  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is empowered to promulgate rules and regulations in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) and to prescribe forms to administer the provisions of this act.  Notwithstanding any provisions of P.L.1968, c.410 to the contrary, the director may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, such regulations as the director deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date of the filing. Such regulations may thereafter be amended, adopted or readopted by the director as the director deems necessary in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410. 10.  Nothing in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall be interpreted to deny a disabled veteran from receiving any credit, rebate, or deduction guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution. 11.  This act shall take effect immediately.
