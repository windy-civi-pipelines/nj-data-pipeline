For municipalities operating under the State fiscal year, the amount for local municipal purposes shall be the amount as certified pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.40A:4-12.1).  The table shall also include a footnote showing the amount raised by taxation for municipal purposes as shown in the State fiscal year budget ending June 30 of the year the table is prepared. In addition to the above such other matters may be added, or such changes in the foregoing items may be made, as may from time to time be directed by the Director of the Division of Taxation.  The forms for filling out tables of aggregates shall be prescribed by the director and sent by him to the county treasurers of the several counties to be by them transmitted to the county board of taxation.  Such table of aggregates shall be correctly added by columns and shall be signed by the members of the county board of taxation and shall within three days thereafter be transmitted to the county treasurer who shall file the same and forthwith cause it to be printed in its entirety and shall transmit certified copy of same to the Director of the Division of Taxation, the State Auditor, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, the clerk of the board of freeholders, and the clerk of each municipality in the county. (cf: P.L.1995, c.345, s.1) 5.    (New section)  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury may inspect all records in the office of the collector and the assessor with respect to claims and allowances for the disabled veterans' total property tax exemption provided for in section 1 of P.L.1948, c.259 (C.54:4-3.30). 6.    (New section)  The Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury is authorized to adopt regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.       (C. ) (now pending before the Legislature as this bill). 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require the State to annually reimburse each municipality for the cost of complying with the State mandate of affording disabled veterans with a total exemption from property taxation.  The bill would require the State to cover the cost of the actual taxes exempted plus the administrative costs incurred by municipalities in connection with the reimbursement program. Under current law, each municipality must individually make up for any lost revenue resulting from a parcel of property being exempted from property taxation because of its ownership by a disabled veteran.  This often results in an increase in taxes to other property taxpayers in the municipality or a reduction in municipal services.  Because the number of qualifying disabled veterans varies from municipality to municipality, compliance with the State policy to exempt disabled veterans' property taxes impacts upon some municipalities more greatly than on others resulting in inequity.  This bill would put an end to that inequity by having the State reimburse each municipality for the cost of complying with the State mandate of affording disabled veterans with a total exemption from property taxation.
