STATEMENT This bill requires the Commission on Human Trafficking to promote a coordinated response among State and local law enforcement agencies to facilitate investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking cases.  The Commission on Human Trafficking was established by P.L.2013, c.31, and is directed, by the enabling statute, N.J.S.A.52:17B-237, to evaluate the existing law concerning human trafficking and the enforcement thereof, and to make recommendations for legislation. The commission, established in the Division of Criminal Justice in the Department of Law and Public Safety Human Trafficking Task Force is specifically charged with reviewing existing victim assistance programs, and promoting a coordinated response by public and private resources for victims of human trafficking. This bill would expand the function of the commission to include promoting a coordinated intergovernmental law enforcement response to human trafficking.  Federal Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) funding may be available for other New Jersey-based task force coordination efforts, such as coordinating an intergovernmental law enforcement response to human trafficking as set forth in the bill. It is the sponsors view that a coordinated effort among law enforcement agencies, including qualifying for federal resources, will strengthen the law enforcement resources available to combat human trafficking.
