The board may also, in its discretion and for good cause, notify a veterinarian that the veterinarian is ineligible to offset credits of continuing veterinary education pursuant to this subsection for any other reason established by regulation by the board. c.    As used in this section [, volunteer]: Community cat means a cat, whether or not fearful of, or socialized to, humans, that has no known owner, lives and freely roams in the outdoors, and that may or may not be cared for by a person, including, but not limited to, by a person who provides food, water, veterinary care, or indoor or outdoor protection from the weather. Volunteer veterinary services means veterinary care provided without charge to: (1)  a person eligible for, and participating in, at least one of the programs enumerated in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-2); [or] (2)  a licensed shelter [or] , pound [licensed by the Department of Health and Senior Services or a municipally approved managed cat colony, provided that the municipality or nonprofit group or organization managing the cat colony has attested in writing to the veterinarian that the cat to be spayed or neutered or otherwise treated by the veterinarian is feral or stray with no known owner.] , or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (3)  a municipality, county, or nonprofit group or organization that is operating a program of humanely trapping community cats, and sterilizing, ear-tipping, and vaccinating the community cats against rabies before returning the community cats to the locations where the community cats were trapped. A person or entity described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection providing or receiving veterinary care without charge for a community cat shall attest in writing that the cat has no known owner. (cf: P.L.2010, c.89, s.3) 13.  Sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) are repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill, designated as the Compassion for Community Cats Law, provides for the spaying and neutering of stray or feral cats. In particular, the bill provides, with limited exceptions, that: (1)  no cat may be released for adoption from an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound unless the cat has been spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian; and (2)  any community cat trapped and impounded at a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or trapped and taken to an animal rescue organization facility, must be spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, and vaccinated against rabies before being returned to the location where the community cat was trapped or given to a person assuming ownership of the community cat. The spaying and neutering requirements do not apply to a cat or a community cat that: (1)  is less than two months old; (2)  a licensed veterinarian determines cannot be spayed or neutered for other health reasons affecting the cat; (3)  is placed in a foster home or transferred to another shelter, pound, kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or animal rescue organization facility by a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (4)  is to be euthanized in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16) and R.S.4:22-19, which provide for humanely euthanizing animals after a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has offered the animal for adoption for at least seven days. The bill authorizes an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound to charge the cost of spaying or neutering the cat to the person assuming ownership of the cat. The bill also amends various sections of existing law to allow for the implementation of the new spaying and neutering requirements established by the bill and other provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations necessary to implement grant programs and fund the spaying and neutering requirements established in the bill. The bill establishes the Compassion for Community Cats Fund in the DOH to provide grants to municipalities and counties to establish programs to humanely trap community cats, and sterilize, ear-tip, and vaccinate them against rabies, and return each feral cat to the location where the cat was trapped.  The Compassion for Community Cats Fund is to be credited with the monies collected for violations of the bill, the surcharge on dog licenses imposed by section 1 of P.L.1983, c.181 (C.4:19-15.3c), any moneys appropriated by the Legislature, and any return on investment of moneys deposited in the fund. Finally, the bill repeals sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and 4:19-15.31), known as the Pet Sterilization Pilot Program." Feral cat populations have existed in the State since the time of the first European settlements and they continue to exist primarily due to a lack of effective management in the form of spaying and neutering. To a lesser but still important extent, cats are abandoned, stray from their owners, or are allowed to roam unsupervised, and, if sexually intact, will reproduce. Feral cats are known as community cats because they live outdoors and are not owned by anyone but may be cared for by members of the community.  The practice of catch and kill, whereby community cats are trapped and subsequently euthanized, has failed to effectively manage feral cat populations and the continued use of catch and kill is an inhumane practice that is incompatible with the moral values of this State. Trap, neuter, vaccinate and return, also known as TNVR, is the most effective, compassionate, and humane method of managing these populations of community cats.  TNVR is a nonlethal population control method in which community cats are humanely trapped, vaccinated against rabies, and spayed or neutered by licensed veterinarians, and then returned to the location where they were trapped. TNVR is also the most effective method of reducing the burden of community cats on the States animal shelters.  The Office of Veterinary Public Health in the Department of Health reported that cats accounted for more than half of the animals impounded and nearly 80 percent of the animals that were euthanized in the States animal shelters in 2017.  The TNVR method of managing community cat populations is also cost effective for the States taxpayers, the most beneficial to public health, and results in improved quality of life for the residents of the State.  Five counties and more than 150 municipalities in the State and the National Animal Care and Control Association, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States endorse TNVR for managing community cat populations. This bill would promote the use of TNVR by enabling municipalities and counties to implement this effective, compassionate and humane method of managing community cat populations through provision of municipal startup grants and by appropriately aligning the use of the Animal Population Control Fund with spraying and neutering services in the State to manage community cat populations.

The commissioner may, however, disqualify from participation in the program any veterinarian whose fees are deemed unreasonable. b.    The commissioner shall, to the extent that moneys are available therefor from the "Animal Population Control Fund," reimburse participating veterinarians for 80% of the fee for each animal sterilization procedure administered, upon the submission of an animal sterilization certificate, prescribed by the commissioner, signed by the veterinarian and the [owner of] person submitting the animal for each sterilization procedure. c.    The commissioner shall reimburse from the fund any State licensed veterinarian [of this State] participating in the program for: (1)  the [presurgical] immunization of dogs against distemper, hepatitis, leptospirosis, and parvovirus [, or] ; (2)  the [presurgical] immunization of cats against feline panleukopenia, calici, pneumonitis and rhinotracheitis [, as the case may be, which immunization shall be administered at least 10 days prior to reproductive surgery, on animals not previously immunized. The reimbursement shall be for no more than $10.00 upon the written certification, signed by the veterinarian and the owner of the animal, that the immunization has been administered.]; or (3)  the immunization of community cats against rabies. d.  The reimbursement shall be for no more than $10 upon the written certification, signed by the veterinarian and the person submitting the cat or dog for spaying or neutering, that the immunization has been administered. e.  A community cat spayed or neutered through the program shall also be ear-tipped and vaccinated against rabies by the State licensed veterinarian performing the spaying or neutering. (cf: P.L.1983, c.172, s.5) 11.  Section 6 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-5) is amended to read as follows: 6.    a.  The commissioner may: (1)  solicit and accept funds from any public or private source to help carry out the provisions of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-1 et al.); and (2)  contract with a nonprofit organization that is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3), for the administration of the Animal Population Control Program established pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-1). b.    All fees collected pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19-15.3b) and sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.43:19A-2 and C.4:19A-3), all moneys from the application and renewal fees collected for animal welfare license plates issued pursuant to P.L.1993, c.184 (C.39:3-27.55 et seq.), and all moneys received pursuant to subsection a. of this section, shall be placed in a special fund to be known as the "Animal Population Control Fund," which shall be separate from the General State Fund. All moneys in the "Animal Population Control Fund" shall be used by the commissioner exclusively for the implementation and promotion of the program and for the costs associated with the administration of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-1 et al.), except as provided in subsection c. of this section. c.    Moneys deposited into the fund generated by the collection of application fees for animal welfare license plates issued pursuant to P.L.1993, c.184 (C.39:3-27.55 et seq.) shall be utilized by the commissioner to reimburse the Division of Motor Vehicles for all costs incurred by the division, as certified by the director, of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of animal welfare license plates. No moneys deposited in the "Animal Population Control Fund," established in subsection b. of this section, except for the moneys generated by the collection of application fees for animal welfare license plates issued pursuant to P.L.1993, c.184 (C.39:3-27.55 et seq.), shall be utilized by the Department of Health or the Division of Motor Vehicles for any expenses, administrative or otherwise, related to the animal welfare license plates, or the advertising and publicizing thereof, including, but not limited to notices, posters and signs to be circulated or posted by the department or the division. d.    The director shall annually certify to the commissioner the average cost per license plate incurred in the immediately preceding year by the division in producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of animal welfare license plates. The annual certification of the average cost per license plate shall be approved by the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor. e.    In the event that the average cost per license plate as certified by the director and approved by the Joint Budget Oversight Committee, or its successor, is greater than the $50 application fee established in subsection b. of section 1 of P.L.1993, c.184 (C.39:3-27.55) in two consecutive fiscal years, the director may discontinue the issuance of animal welfare license plates. (cf: P.L.1995, c.145, s.3) 12.  Section 3 of P.L.2010, c.89 (C.45:16-9.4a) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  The State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners shall establish, through the promulgation of regulations, any specific courses or topics which are to be required for continuing veterinary education, and designate which are the core requirements for continuing veterinary education, including the number of required hours, subject matter and content of courses of study. For purposes of this section, core requirements means the continuing veterinary education determined by the board to be necessary to maintain currency in professional knowledge and skills in order to deliver competent veterinary care. b.    The board may offset up to 10 percent of the requisite number of hours of continuing veterinary education required pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1952, c.198 (C.45:16-9.4) by the number of volunteer veterinary services rendered by licensees, at a rate of one half of one hour of continuing veterinary education for each hour of volunteer veterinary services, provided that a veterinarian shall be required to complete at least the core requirements established pursuant to subsection a. of this section. In addition, the board may adopt a formula providing a minimum number of spaying or neutering procedures that shall be deemed the equivalent of one hour of continuing veterinary education. The board may reduce, in part, an application by a licensee to offset credits of continuing veterinary education pursuant to this subsection if the board finds, in its discretion, that the applicant requires continuing veterinary education in order to maintain or restore professional competence, or may deny all applications if the board finds that continuing veterinary education above the core requirements is necessary because of developments in science or technology. The board may also, in its discretion and for good cause, notify a veterinarian that the veterinarian is ineligible to offset credits of continuing veterinary education pursuant to this subsection for any other reason established by regulation by the board. c.    As used in this section [, volunteer]: Community cat means a cat, whether or not fearful of, or socialized to, humans, that has no known owner, lives and freely roams in the outdoors, and that may or may not be cared for by a person, including, but not limited to, by a person who provides food, water, veterinary care, or indoor or outdoor protection from the weather. Volunteer veterinary services means veterinary care provided without charge to: (1)  a person eligible for, and participating in, at least one of the programs enumerated in section 3 of P.L.1983, c.172 (C.4:19A-2); [or] (2)  a licensed shelter [or] , pound [licensed by the Department of Health and Senior Services or a municipally approved managed cat colony, provided that the municipality or nonprofit group or organization managing the cat colony has attested in writing to the veterinarian that the cat to be spayed or neutered or otherwise treated by the veterinarian is feral or stray with no known owner.] , or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (3)  a municipality, county, or nonprofit group or organization that is operating a program of humanely trapping community cats, and sterilizing, ear-tipping, and vaccinating the community cats against rabies before returning the community cats to the locations where the community cats were trapped. A person or entity described in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection providing or receiving veterinary care without charge for a community cat shall attest in writing that the cat has no known owner. (cf: P.L.2010, c.89, s.3) 13.  Sections 3 and 4 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and C.4:19-15.31) are repealed. 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The bill, designated as the Compassion for Community Cats Law, provides for the spaying and neutering of stray or feral cats. In particular, the bill provides, with limited exceptions, that: (1)  no cat may be released for adoption from an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound unless the cat has been spayed or neutered by a licensed veterinarian; and (2)  any community cat trapped and impounded at a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or trapped and taken to an animal rescue organization facility, must be spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, and vaccinated against rabies before being returned to the location where the community cat was trapped or given to a person assuming ownership of the community cat. The spaying and neutering requirements do not apply to a cat or a community cat that: (1)  is less than two months old; (2)  a licensed veterinarian determines cannot be spayed or neutered for other health reasons affecting the cat; (3)  is placed in a foster home or transferred to another shelter, pound, kennel operating as a shelter or pound, or animal rescue organization facility by a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound; or (4)  is to be euthanized in accordance with the provisions of section 16 of P.L.1941, c.151 (C.4:19-15.16) and R.S.4:22-19, which provide for humanely euthanizing animals after a shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has offered the animal for adoption for at least seven days. The bill authorizes an animal rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound to charge the cost of spaying or neutering the cat to the person assuming ownership of the cat. The bill also amends various sections of existing law to allow for the implementation of the new spaying and neutering requirements established by the bill and other provisions of the bill.  The bill authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations necessary to implement grant programs and fund the spaying and neutering requirements established in the bill. The bill establishes the Compassion for Community Cats Fund in the DOH to provide grants to municipalities and counties to establish programs to humanely trap community cats, and sterilize, ear-tip, and vaccinate them against rabies, and return each feral cat to the location where the cat was trapped.  The Compassion for Community Cats Fund is to be credited with the monies collected for violations of the bill, the surcharge on dog licenses imposed by section 1 of P.L.1983, c.181 (C.4:19-15.3c), any moneys appropriated by the Legislature, and any return on investment of moneys deposited in the fund. Finally, the bill repeals sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and 4:19-15.31), known as the Pet Sterilization Pilot Program." Feral cat populations have existed in the State since the time of the first European settlements and they continue to exist primarily due to a lack of effective management in the form of spaying and neutering. To a lesser but still important extent, cats are abandoned, stray from their owners, or are allowed to roam unsupervised, and, if sexually intact, will reproduce. Feral cats are known as community cats because they live outdoors and are not owned by anyone but may be cared for by members of the community.  The practice of catch and kill, whereby community cats are trapped and subsequently euthanized, has failed to effectively manage feral cat populations and the continued use of catch and kill is an inhumane practice that is incompatible with the moral values of this State. Trap, neuter, vaccinate and return, also known as TNVR, is the most effective, compassionate, and humane method of managing these populations of community cats.  TNVR is a nonlethal population control method in which community cats are humanely trapped, vaccinated against rabies, and spayed or neutered by licensed veterinarians, and then returned to the location where they were trapped. TNVR is also the most effective method of reducing the burden of community cats on the States animal shelters.  The Office of Veterinary Public Health in the Department of Health reported that cats accounted for more than half of the animals impounded and nearly 80 percent of the animals that were euthanized in the States animal shelters in 2017.  The TNVR method of managing community cat populations is also cost effective for the States taxpayers, the most beneficial to public health, and results in improved quality of life for the residents of the State.  Five counties and more than 150 municipalities in the State and the National Animal Care and Control Association, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States endorse TNVR for managing community cat populations. This bill would promote the use of TNVR by enabling municipalities and counties to implement this effective, compassionate and humane method of managing community cat populations through provision of municipal startup grants and by appropriately aligning the use of the Animal Population Control Fund with spraying and neutering services in the State to manage community cat populations.
