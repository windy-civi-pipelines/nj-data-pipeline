<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  any community cat trapped

the location where the community cat was trapped or given to a person assuming
ownership of the community cat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The spaying and neutering

and R.S.4:22-19, which provide for humanely euthanizing animals after a
shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter or pound has offered the
animal for adoption for at least seven days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes an animal
rescue organization facility, shelter, pound, or kennel operating as a shelter
or pound to charge the cost of spaying or neutering the cat to the person
assuming ownership of the cat.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends various
sections of existing law to allow for the implementation of the new spaying and
neutering requirements established by the bill and other provisions of the
bill.  The bill authorizes the Department of Health (DOH) to adopt regulations
necessary to implement grant programs and fund the spaying and neutering
requirements established in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes the Compassion
for Community Cats Fund in the DOH to provide grants to municipalities and
counties to establish programs to humanely trap community cats, and sterilize,
ear-tip, and vaccinate them against rabies, and return each feral cat to the
location where the cat was trapped.  The Compassion for Community Cats Fund
is to be credited with the monies collected for violations of the bill, the
surcharge on dog licenses imposed by section 1 of P.L.1983, c.181 (C.4:19-15.3c),
any moneys appropriated by the Legislature, and any return on investment of
moneys deposited in the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill repeals
sections 2 and 3 of P.L.2011, c.142 (C.4:19-15.30 and 4:19-15.31), known as the
Pet Sterilization Pilot Program.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Feral cat populations have
existed in the State since the time of the first European settlements and they
continue to exist primarily due to a lack of effective management in the form
of spaying and neutering. To a lesser but still important extent, cats are
abandoned, stray from their owners, or are allowed to roam unsupervised, and,
if sexually intact, will reproduce. Feral cats are known as community cats
because they live outdoors and are not owned by anyone but may be cared for by
members of the community.  The practice of catch and kill, whereby community
cats are trapped and subsequently euthanized, has failed to effectively manage
feral cat populations and the continued use of catch and kill is an inhumane
practice that is incompatible with the moral values of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Trap, neuter, vaccinate and
return, also known as TNVR, is the most effective, compassionate, and humane
method of managing these populations of community cats.  TNVR is a nonlethal
population control method in which community cats are humanely trapped,
vaccinated against rabies, and spayed or neutered by licensed veterinarians,
and then returned to the location where they were trapped. TNVR is also the
most effective method of reducing the burden of community cats on the States
animal shelters.  The Office of Veterinary Public Health in the Department of
Health reported that cats accounted for more than half of the animals impounded
and nearly 80 percent of the animals that were euthanized in the States animal
shelters in 2017.  The TNVR method of managing community cat populations is
also cost effective for the States taxpayers, the most beneficial to public
health, and results in improved quality of life for the residents of the
State.  Five counties and more than 150 municipalities in the State and the
National Animal Care and Control Association, the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States
endorse TNVR for managing community cat populations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would promote the
use of TNVR by enabling municipalities and counties to implement this
effective, compassionate and humane method of managing community cat
populations through provision of municipal startup grants and by appropriately
aligning the use of the Animal Population Control Fund with spraying and
neutering services in the State to manage community cat populations.</p>
