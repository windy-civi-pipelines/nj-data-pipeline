candidate names to determine their ballot position and amending various parts

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.19:14-12 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19:14-12.  The county clerk
shall draw lots in his county to determine which columns the political parties
which made nominations at the next preceding primary election shall occupy on
the ballot in the county.  The name of the party first drawn shall occupy the
first column at the left of the ballot, and the name of the party next drawn
shall occupy the second column, and so forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The position which the names
of candidates, and bracketed groups of names of candidates nominated by
petitions for all offices, shall have upon the general election ballot, shall
be determined by the county clerks in their respective counties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The manner of drawing the lots
shall be as follows: paper slips with the names of each political party written
thereon, shall be placed in capsules of the same size, shape, color and
substance and then placed in a covered box with an aperture in the top large
enough to admit a man's hand and to allow the capsules to be drawn therefrom. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Each political party
participating in the drawing of lots shall be entitled to designate a member of
the party to be present for the drawing, who shall be entitled to inspect the
paper slips upon which the names of each political party are to be written, the
capsules in which the paper slips are placed, and the box from which the
capsules are to be drawn before the drawing begins, after each name is drawn,
and at the conclusion of the drawing.  The county clerk shall notify each
political party participating in the drawing of the date, time, and location of
the drawing not less than 72 hours prior to when the drawing is scheduled to
begin.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The box shall be well shaken
and turned over to thoroughly intermingle the capsules.  The county clerk or
his deputy shall at his office, draw from the box each capsule separately
without knowledge on his part as to which capsule he is drawing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The person making the drawing
shall open the capsule and shall make public announcement at the drawing of
each name, the order in which name is drawn and the office for which the
drawing is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Where there is but one person
to be elected to an office, the names of the several candidates who have filed
petitions for such office shall be written upon paper slips and placed in
separate capsules of the same size, shape, color and substance.  The capsules
shall be placed in a covered box with an aperture in the top large enough to
admit a man's hand and to allow the capsules to be drawn therefrom.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>Each candidate
participating in the drawing of lots, or their designee, shall be entitled to be
present for the drawing and to inspect the paper slips upon which the names of
each candidate are to be written, the capsules in which the paper slips are
placed, and the box from which the capsules are to be drawn before the drawing
begins, after each name is drawn, and at the conclusion of the drawing.  The
county clerk shall notify each candidate participating in the drawing of lots
of the date, time, and location of the drawing not less than 72 hours prior to
when the drawing is scheduled to begin.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The box shall be turned and
shaken thoroughly to mix the capsules and the capsules shall be withdrawn one
at a time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When there is more than one
person to be elected to an office where petitions have designated that certain
candidates shall be bracketed, the position of such bracketed names on the
ballot (each bracketed group to be treated as a single name), together with
individuals who have filed petitions for such office, shall be determined as
above described.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any legal voter of the county
or municipality, as the case may be, shall have the privilege of witnessing the
drawing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The name or names of the candidate
or bracketed group of candidates first drawn from the box shall be printed
directly below the proper title of the office for which they were nominated,
and the name or names of the candidate or bracketed group of candidates next
drawn shall be printed next in order, and so on, until the last name or
bracketed group of names shall be drawn from the box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The arrangement of names of
any bracketed group of candidates for any office for which more than one are to
be elected shall be printed in the same order on the ballot as they were
arranged on the petition of nomination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The drawing for the positions
which the names of candidates and bracketed groups of names of candidates,
nominated by petition for office, and for the columns which the political parties
which made nominations at the next preceding primary election and for the
general election shall occupy upon the general election ballot, shall be held
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon of the eighty-fifth day prior to the day of the
general election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2011, c.134, s.22)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    R.S.19:23-24 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     19:23-24.  The position which
the candidates and bracketed groups of names of candidates for the primary for
the general election shall have upon the ballots used for the primary election
for the general election, in the case of candidates for nomination for members
of the United States Senate, Governor, members of the House of Representatives,
members of the State Senate, members of the General Assembly, choice for
President, delegates and alternates-at-large to the national conventions of
political parties, district delegates and alternates to conventions of
political parties, candidates for party positions, and county offices or party
positions which are to be voted for by the voters of the entire county or a
portion thereof greater than a single municipality, including a congressional

office or party position wherein the candidates for office or party position to
be filled are to be voted for by the voters of a municipality only, or a
subdivision thereof (excepting in the case of members of the House of
Representatives) shall be determined by the municipal clerk in such
municipalities, in the following manner:  The county clerk, or the county
clerk's deputy, or the municipal clerk or the municipal clerk's deputy, as the
case may be, shall at the clerk's office on the 61st day prior to the primary

participating in the drawing of lots, or their designee, shall be entitled to
be present for the drawing and to inspect the cards upon which the names of
each candidate are to be written and the box from which the cards are to be
drawn before the drawing begins, after each name is drawn, and at the
conclusion of the drawing.  The county clerk or municipal clerk, as the case
may be, shall notify each candidate participating in the drawing of lots of the
date, time, and location of the drawing not less than 72 hours prior to when

the cards from the box determining the order of arrangement in which the names
shall appear upon the primary election ballot.  Where there is more than one
person to be nominated to an office where petitions have designated that
certain candidates shall be bracketed, the position of such bracketed names on
the ballot (each bracket to be treated as a single name), together with
individuals who have filed petitions for nomination for such office, shall be
determined as above described.  Where there is more than one person to be
nominated for an office and there are more candidates who have filed petitions
than there are persons to be nominated, the order of the printing of such names
upon the primary election ballots shall be determined as above described.</p>

to the municipal clerk the offices to be filled and the names of candidates to
be printed upon the ballots used for the primary election for the general

described procedure, and the municipal clerk shall print the names upon the
ballots as so certified and in addition shall print the names of such
candidates as have filed petitions with him in the order as determined as a
result of the drawing as above described.  Candidates for the office of the
county executive in counties that have adopted the county executive plan of the
&quot;Optional County Charter Law,&quot; P.L.1972, c.154 (C.40:41A-1 et seq.),
