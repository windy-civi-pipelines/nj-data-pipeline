The bill is based on a recommendation made by the Election Law Enforcement Commission, which receives the candidate financial disclosure statements. In an Annual Report, the commission noted that changing the date will provide candidates with more time in which to carefully complete these forms, along with a less confusing due date, [which] will enhance compliance and disclosure with the law.
