STATEMENT This joint resolution designates February 4th of each year as Women and Girls in Sports Day in New Jersey. Opportunities in sports were traditionally only open to men, and women were discouraged from taking an interest in, or participating in, athletics. In the 20th and 21st centuries, women and girls increasingly strove to participate in sports. However, gender disparities in sports still remain, with less support and resources available for womens sports programs, in comparison with mens sports. This lack of investment has contributed to gender pay disparities for female athletes and the unequal allocation of facilities and equipment for womens and girls sports. Despite these inequities, inspiring female athletes, such as New Jersey natives Carli Lloyd and Laurie Hernandez, have made significant contributions to sports and have served as excellent role models for fans of all ages and genders. Women and girls deserve recognition for their contributions to sports and public awareness of their fight for gender equality in athletics. It should be further acknowledged that sports are essential in the lives of girls, since participation in sports teaches important life skills that empower girls to stand up against gender inequities, both in sports and in daily life. Participation in sports, moreover, encourages women and girls to become and remain physically active, which is essential to achieving and maintaining good physical and mental health throughout life.
