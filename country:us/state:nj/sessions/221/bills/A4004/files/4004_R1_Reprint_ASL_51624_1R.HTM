<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 7 of P.L.1944,
c.255 (C.43:16A-7) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7. a. (1) Upon the written
application by a member in service, by one acting in his behalf or by his
employer any member may be retired on an accidental disability retirement
allowance; provided, that the medical board, after a medical examination of
such member, shall certify that the member is permanently and totally disabled
as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the
performance of his regular or assigned duties and that such disability was not
the result of the member's willful negligence and that such member is mentally
or physically incapacitated for the performance of his usual duty and of any
other available duty in the department which his employer is willing to assign
to him.  The application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within
five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may
consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability
is due to the accident and the filing was not accomplished within the five-year
period due to a delayed manifestation of the disability or to other
circumstances beyond the control of the member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Upon retirement for
accidental disability, a member shall receive an accidental disability
retirement allowance which shall consist of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   An annuity which shall
be the actuarial equivalent of his aggregate contributions and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  A pension in the amount
which, when added to the member's annuity, will provide a total retirement
allowance of 2/3 of the member's actual annual compensation for which
contributions were being made at the time of the occurrence of the accident or
at the time of the member's retirement, whichever provides the largest possible
benefit to the member.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Upon receipt of proper
proofs of the death of a member who has retired on accidental disability
retirement allowance, there shall be paid to such member's beneficiary, an
amount equal to 3 1/2 times the compensation upon which contributions by the
member to the annuity savings fund were based in the last year of creditable
service; provided, however, that if such death shall occur after the member
shall have attained 55 years of age the amount payable shall equal 1/2 of such
compensation instead of 3 1/2 times such compensation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Permanent and total
disability resulting from a cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculoskeletal
condition which was not a direct result of a traumatic event occurring in the performance
of duty shall be deemed an ordinary disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (1) For purposes of this
subsection: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Qualifying condition or
impairment of health&quot; includes:</p>
