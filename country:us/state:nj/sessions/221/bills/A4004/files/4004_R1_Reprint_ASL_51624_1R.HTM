Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 7 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7. a. (1) Upon the written application by a member in service, by one acting in his behalf or by his employer any member may be retired on an accidental disability retirement allowance; provided, that the medical board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that the member is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties and that such disability was not the result of the member's willful negligence and that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of his usual duty and of any other available duty in the department which his employer is willing to assign to him.  The application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability is due to the accident and the filing was not accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of the disability or to other circumstances beyond the control of the member. (2)  Upon retirement for accidental disability, a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a)   An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his aggregate contributions and (b)  A pension in the amount which, when added to the member's annuity, will provide a total retirement allowance of 2/3 of the member's actual annual compensation for which contributions were being made at the time of the occurrence of the accident or at the time of the member's retirement, whichever provides the largest possible benefit to the member. (3)  Upon receipt of proper proofs of the death of a member who has retired on accidental disability retirement allowance, there shall be paid to such member's beneficiary, an amount equal to 3 1/2 times the compensation upon which contributions by the member to the annuity savings fund were based in the last year of creditable service; provided, however, that if such death shall occur after the member shall have attained 55 years of age the amount payable shall equal 1/2 of such compensation instead of 3 1/2 times such compensation.

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 7 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7. a. (1) Upon the written application by a member in service, by one acting in his behalf or by his employer any member may be retired on an accidental disability retirement allowance; provided, that the medical board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that the member is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties and that such disability was not the result of the member's willful negligence and that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of his usual duty and of any other available duty in the department which his employer is willing to assign to him.  The application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic event, but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the five-year period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees that the disability is due to the accident and the filing was not accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of the disability or to other circumstances beyond the control of the member. (2)  Upon retirement for accidental disability, a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance which shall consist of: (a)   An annuity which shall be the actuarial equivalent of his aggregate contributions and (b)  A pension in the amount which, when added to the member's annuity, will provide a total retirement allowance of 2/3 of the member's actual annual compensation for which contributions were being made at the time of the occurrence of the accident or at the time of the member's retirement, whichever provides the largest possible benefit to the member. (3)  Upon receipt of proper proofs of the death of a member who has retired on accidental disability retirement allowance, there shall be paid to such member's beneficiary, an amount equal to 3 1/2 times the compensation upon which contributions by the member to the annuity savings fund were based in the last year of creditable service; provided, however, that if such death shall occur after the member shall have attained 55 years of age the amount payable shall equal 1/2 of such compensation instead of 3 1/2 times such compensation. (4)  Permanent and total disability resulting from a cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculoskeletal condition which was not a direct result of a traumatic event occurring in the performance of duty shall be deemed an ordinary disability. b.

A member who did not participate in such operations for a minimum of eight hours shall be eligible for the presumption provided that: the member participated in the rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001; the member sustained a documented physical injury at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001 that is a qualifying condition or impairment of health resulting in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours; and the documented physical injury that resulted in a disability to the member that prevented the member from continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for a minimum of eight hours is the qualifying condition or impairment of health for which the member seeks a presumption under this subsection.

(2)  A surviving spouse who received the pension in accordance with section 25 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-25), but whose eligibility for that pension was terminated because the surviving spouse no longer met the definition of "surviving spouse" as set forth in section 3 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-3), shall be eligible to apply to the board of trustees and, upon approval of the application by the board, shall receive the accidental death benefits set forth in section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14) under the same terms and conditions and pursuant to the same requirements as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.  If the former spouse receives the accidental death benefits as set forth in section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14), a surviving child or children who are receiving benefits pursuant to section 25 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-25) shall no longer be eligible to receive those benefits. (3)  If there is no surviving spouse or no former surviving spouse because the spouse has died or has declined in writing to apply pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the surviving child or surviving children who are receiving benefits in accordance with section 25 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-25) on the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.75 (C.53:5A-14.5), or the effective date of P.L.      , c.         (pending before the Legislature as this bill), as applicable, or any legal guardian of the child or children, may submit the application and receive the benefits set forth in section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14) under the same terms and conditions and pursuant to the same requirements as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection. (4)  The board of trustees shall provide written notification to each surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, and surviving child, and any legal guardian of a surviving child, of the provisions of this subsection, within 30 days after the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.75 (C.53:5A-14.5), or within 30 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.         (pending before the Legislature as this bill) by letter sent via certified mail.

(6)  The board of trustees shall require the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, to submit such information as the deceased member or retiree would have been required to submit in accordance with subsection e. of section 10 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-10) and such other information as the board of trustees may deem necessary to review the application and make a determination.  Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection shall apply only if the retiree's death was the result of a qualifying condition or impairment of health as defined in subsection e. of section 10 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-10) which the medical board determines to be caused by participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations [and if the deceased member or retiree died before July 8, 2019]. (7)  Upon approval of an application, the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child or children, or any legal guardian of the surviving child or children, shall receive the annual payments of the accidental death benefit, and the lump sum death benefit payment, as set forth in section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14).  The annual benefit payments shall apply only for payments made after the effective date of this act , P.L.2021, c.75 (C.53:5A-14.5), or the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), as applicable.  No surviving spouse or former surviving spouse or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, shall be granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit pursuant to this subsection had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the effective date of this act.  The lump sum benefit paid to a beneficiary shall be and shall not exceed 3 1/2 times the retiree's final compensation in total regardless of the provision of law under which the lump sum death benefit was paid. (8)  The health care benefit premiums to be paid by the State in accordance with subsection h. of section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14) shall apply if the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child or children are still receiving coverage from the employer-sponsored health insurance program or, if that coverage was terminated, can again become eligible for such coverage.  If such coverage is no longer available, the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child or children shall be eligible to enroll in the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), notwithstanding any provision thereof to the contrary. c.    This act, P.L.2021, c.75 (C.53:5A-14.5), shall be known and may be cited as the Trooper I Robert Nagle and Staff Sergeant Bryan McCoy 911 First Responders Act.1 (cf: P.L.2021, c.75, s.1) 1[4.] 5.1  This act shall take effect immediately.
