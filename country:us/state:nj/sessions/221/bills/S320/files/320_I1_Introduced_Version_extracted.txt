(cf: P.L.1955, c.124, s.6) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows members of religious corporations to hold meetings solely or in part by means of remote communication during a state of emergency. Pursuant to current law, meetings of members are required to be held at a physical location, with no provision for members to participate by alternative means during a state of emergency. Under this bill, remote communication of meetings will be permitted if a state of emergency is declared by the Governor. During the state of emergency, a meeting of members may be held by means of remote communication to the extent that the board of trustees authorize and adopt guidelines and procedures governing such a meeting. The bill also provides that members are deemed present if participating in a meeting by means of remote communication, regardless of whether the meeting is held solely by means of remote communication or in part. In times of crisis, remote meetings can offer broader accessibility to members and increase member participation. It also provides religious corporations with the flexibility that they may need to respond to any challenges that may occur because of a state of emergency declaration.
