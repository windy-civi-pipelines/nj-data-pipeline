Whereas, On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack to deliberately target Israeli civilians, including the killing and abduction of men, women, children, and the elderly; and Whereas, Hamas and Hezbollah, both recognized by the United States Department of State as Foreign Terrorist Organizations, have sought the destruction of the State of Israel and the murder of its Jewish citizens; and Whereas, A disturbing number of student organizations at institutions of higher education placed blame solely upon the State of Israel for the attack, and expressed support for the terrorist actions of Hamas through the glorification of violence and the use of anti-Semitic rhetoric; and Whereas, In response to the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict, students at institutions of higher education across the country established encampments to protest the conflict; and Whereas, Student protestors at Rutgers University-New Brunswick established an encampment on the lawns of Voorhees Mall on April 29, 2024, disturbing the operations of the institution, glorifying the violence Hamas has inflicted on the Israeli people, and utilizing anti-Semitic rhetoric; and Whereas, The student protestors demanded 10 actions from Rutgers, including: a divestment of funds from any corporation materially participating in, benefitting from, or otherwise supporting the State of Israel; the termination of the institutions partnership with Tel Aviv University; the establishment of a memorandum of understanding with Birzeit University; the acceptance of, and scholarships for, 10 Gazan students; a statement from President Jonathan Holloway referring to the conflict as a genocide and advocating for a ceasefire; hiring based on cultural competency; and full amnesty for those participating in the encampment; and Whereas, Rutgers University accepted eight out of 10 of the demands of the anti-Semitic protestors in return for an end to the encampment; and Whereas, The administration of Rutgers University, in acquiescing to the demands of the protestors, displayed a blatant disregard for its Jewish and pro-Israel students; and Whereas, The glorification of violence and use of anti-Semitic rhetoric, a form of hate speech, creates a hostile learning and working environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff; and Whereas, Due to the anti-Semitic practices of the administration of the institution, it is altogether fitting and proper for the Legislature of the State of New Jersey to condemn the actions of Rutgers, The State University; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House condemns the actions of Rutgers, The State University, in acquiescing to the demands of the anti-Semitic protestors, which served the short-term goal of disbanding the encampment, but failed to enforce the institutional rules and policies designed to protect all students from a toxic campus environment. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate to the president of Rutgers University, each member of the Board of Governors of Rutgers University, and each member of the Board of Trustees of Rutgers University. STATEMENT This resolution condemns Rutgers, The State Universitys acquiescence to anti-Semitic protests. In response to the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict, students at institutions of higher education across the country established protests and encampments to protest the conflict, including Rutgers University-New Brunswick. On April 29, 2024 student protestors at Rutgers established an encampment on the lawns of Voorhees mall, disturbing the operations of the institution, glorifying the violence Hamas has inflicted on the Israeli people, and utilizing anti-Semitic rhetoric. The student protestors demanded 10 actions from Rutgers, including: a divestment of funds from any corporation materially participating in, benefitting from, or otherwise supporting the State of Israel; the termination of the institutions partnership with Tel Aviv University; the establishment of a memorandum of understanding with Birzeit University; the acceptance of, and scholarships for, 10 Gazan students; a statement from President Jonathan Holloway referring to the conflict as a genocide and advocating for a ceasefire; hiring based on cultural competency; and full amnesty for those participating in the encampment. Rutgers accepted eight out of 10 of the demands in return for an end to the encampment. In acquiescing to eight of the 10 demands, the administration of Rutgers displayed a blatant disregard for its Jewish and pro-Israel students. The glorification of violence and use of anti-Semitic rhetoric, a form of hate speech, and the acceptance of this hate speech by the administration, creates a hostile learning and working environment for Jewish students, faculty, and staff. Therefore, due to the anti-Semitic practices of the administration of the institution, it is altogether fitting and proper for the Legislature to condemn the institutions acquiescence to the demands of the anti-Semitic protestors.
