<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  The recycling tax imposed
by this section shall not be imposed on a solid waste collector or the owner or
operator of a solid waste facility for the collection or acceptance for
disposal or transfer of residue, provided that the residue is generated as a
result of the use of post-consumer waste material in the manufacture of a
recycled product which constitutes at least 75% of total annual sales dollar
volume of the products manufactured by a manufacturer in this State as
determined by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  The registration issued to
any person subject to the recycling tax who violates the provisions of this

P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-12).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  Subsections a. through k.
of this section shall be without effect on and after the tenth day following a
certification by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting in the
Department of the Treasury pursuant to subsection b. of section 6 of P.L.2007,
c.311 (C.13:1E-96.7).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.  (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that the scrap metal recycling industry is a
longstanding vital component of the State's overall recycling efforts that
provides a key service in preventing scrap metal from entering the waste
stream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Legislature further
finds and declares that the burden of primarily regulating facilities that
receive, store, process, and transfer scrap metal, including, but not limited
to, automobiles or other source separated, non-putrescible ferrous and
nonferrous metals has been shouldered by municipalities, with the unintended
effect of inconsistent operational and environmental controls placed on these facilities
throughout the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The Legislature further
finds and declares that this inconsistent regulation has led to instances where
scrap metal facilities may present significant public health and safety
concerns, including, but not limited to, fires, dust and other airborne
contaminants, polluted stormwater discharges, and other potential environmental
and public health impacts associated with facility operations, and also creates
unnecessary barriers to instituting consistent, Statewide requirements to
mitigate these concerns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the public interest to require scrap metal facilities
to be subject to regulation by the Department of Environmental Protection as
recycling centers so that consistent and Statewide oversight may be implemented
to minimize adverse impacts to public health and the environment.</p>

the department in administering the registration of scrap metal facilities

metal by mechanical methods, including but not limited to baling, cutting,
torching, crushing, or shredding, for purposes of recycling, resale, or reuse,

through the registrations to establish appropriate regulatory, operational, and
management requirements for scrap metal facilities and to determine the
appropriate class of recycling center permit, license, or approval that would
be required for scrap metal facility types, except that any scrap metal
facility that operates a shredder would require an individual recycling center
permit of the class determined by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill would
establish minimum operational requirements for scrap metal facilities that
operate shredders, in addition to all other requirements pertaining to
recycling centers. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the
prevention of the accumulation of shredder residue or scrap metal that would
result in a risk of fire, the placement of shredder residue on impervious surfaces
to control stormwater discharges, the enclosure of any shredder residue to
prevent dust migration, and the implementation of fire suppression systems and
associated training programs and inspection requirements.  </p>

annual budget request to the Governor for funding to implement the bills
provisions.</p>
