(cf: P.L.2008, c.6, s.1) 9.  (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that the scrap metal recycling industry is a longstanding vital component of the State's overall recycling efforts that provides a key service in preventing scrap metal from entering the waste stream. b.  The Legislature further finds and declares that the burden of primarily regulating facilities that receive, store, process, and transfer scrap metal, including, but not limited to, automobiles or other source separated, non-putrescible ferrous and nonferrous metals has been shouldered by municipalities, with the unintended effect of inconsistent operational and environmental controls placed on these facilities throughout the State. c.  The Legislature further finds and declares that this inconsistent regulation has led to instances where scrap metal facilities may present significant public health and safety concerns, including, but not limited to, fires, dust and other airborne contaminants, polluted stormwater discharges, and other potential environmental and public health impacts associated with facility operations, and also creates unnecessary barriers to instituting consistent, Statewide requirements to mitigate these concerns. d.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to require scrap metal facilities to be subject to regulation by the Department of Environmental Protection as recycling centers so that consistent and Statewide oversight may be implemented to minimize adverse impacts to public health and the environment. 10.  (New section)  As used in sections 11 through 15 of  P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Department means the Department of Environmental Protection. Recycling center means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). Scrap metal means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). Scrap metal facility means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). 11.  (New section)  a.  No later than one year after the effective date of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the owner or operator of each scrap metal facility shall register with the department.  The registration shall be submitted in a form and manner to be determined by the department and shall contain: (1) the name, ownership, contact information, and address of the scrap metal facility; (2) documentation of any local, State, or federal approvals obtained by the scrap metal facility; (3) the average weight and volume of scrap metal received at the scrap metal facility on a daily basis; (4) information concerning whether any processing, such as bailing, cutting, torching, crushing, or shredding is conducted at the scrap metal facility; and (5) a description on the types of materials that are processed at the scrap metal facility. b.  In submitting the registration required pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the operator of a scrap metal facility shall: (1) certify to the accuracy of the information submitted as a part of the registration process; and (2) pay a registration fee of $700 to the department. c.  The registration required pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be renewed annually, except that the department may extend the renewal deadline if the department determines that there is good cause to provide an extension. d.  The department may modify the amount of the registration fee to be imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section through the adoption of rules and regulations, provided that the registration fee only accounts for the reasonable costs of the department in administering the registration of scrap metal facilities pursuant to this section. e.  The department shall use the information received through the registrations required pursuant to subsection a. of this section to establish appropriate regulatory, operational, and management requirements for scrap metal facilities and to determine the appropriate class of recycling center permit, license, or approval that shall be required for scrap metal facility types, except that any scrap metal facility that operates a shredder shall require an individual recycling center permit of the class determined by the department. 12.  (New section)  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a scrap metal facility shall be subject to the same requirements as a recycling center, as established under applicable State and federal law. b.  In addition to all requirements pertaining to recycling centers, scrap metal facilities that operate shredders to process scrap metal shall: (1) prevent the accumulation of shredder residue, regardless of source, or scrap material within the confines of the facility of such volumes that would constitute a risk of fire; (2) put in place sufficient operational controls as necessary to ensure that no ignition sources, including spent batteries and spent or unspent lithium-ion batteries, or other electrical energy storage devices, consisting of one or more individual battery modules or cells, are shredded or otherwise processed; (3) ensure that any shredder residue on site is situated on an impervious surface, enclosed within a structure, or otherwise covered to prevent liquid runoff or stormwater discharges, and is subject to dust control technologies to limit the dispersal of fugitive dust; (4) install, maintain, and regularly test an approved fire suppression system, including measures specifically designed to suppress fires that may occur in or around stockpiles or other areas of accumulated scrap metal, or in the vicinity of processing equipment, including shredders.  An approved fire suppression system may include alarm systems, infrared heat sensors, fire retardant dispersal systems, fire breaks, as well as sufficient buffer spacing of at least 25 feet in width to facilitate emergency response and vehicle access throughout the facility.  The system shall meet the requirements of applicable fire codes and standards, and shall include automatic fire detection and suppression capabilities; and (5) train staff in the use of the fire suppression system, implemented pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this subsection at least annually and shall certify that installed fire suppression systems have been inspected by local fire officials as part of the facilitys annual reporting requirements, as established by the department. 13.  (New section)  a.  No later than 18 months after the effective date of P.L.       , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall establish a program to regulate each scrap metal facility in the State as a recycling center, in compliance with the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  The department shall hire a sufficient number of new employees as may be deemed necessary by the department to implement the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  All employees hired pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes. c.  The department shall include in its annual budget a request to the Governor the moneys necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The Legislature shall appropriate the necessary funds to the department for this purpose. 14.  (New section) a.  A violation of the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be considered a violation of the Solid Waste Management Act, P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), and the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall have recourse to any of the actions or penalties provided for in section 9 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-9), in order to address the violation. b.  The department shall have the right to enter, at any time during normal business hours and upon presentation of appropriate credentials, the premises of a scrap metal facility in order to determine compliance with the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.  Any person who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement to the department on any registration or other application, record or other document required to be filed or maintained by P.L.       , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and be subject to a civil administrative penalty of not more than $10,000. 15.  (New section) The department shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations, as necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 16.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would replace the term scrap processing facility with scrap metal facility under applicable State laws and would require scrap metal facilities to register with Department of Environmental Protection (department) and comply with certain requirements established under the bill. The bill would amend existing law to remove the exemption to regulation of scrap processing facilities as recycling centers.  As defined in the bill, scrap metal facility means any facility that receives, stores, transfers, or processes scrap metal, including those that alter or reduce the volume or physical characteristics of scrap metal by mechanical methods, including but not limited to baling, cutting, torching, crushing, or shredding, for purposes of recycling, resale, or reuse, including for remelting, refining, smelting, or remanufacturing into raw materials or products, and includes what is commonly known as a scrapyard or junkyard. The bill would require, no later than one year after the bills effective date, the owner or operator of each scrap metal facility in the State to register with the department and pay a registration fee of $700 to the department.  The registration would be required to be renewed annually unless an extension is granted by the department.  The department would be required to use the information received through the registrations to establish appropriate regulatory, operational, and management requirements for scrap metal facilities and to determine the appropriate class of recycling center permit, license, or approval that would be required for scrap metal facility types, except that any scrap metal facility that operates a shredder would require an individual recycling center permit of the class determined by the department. In addition, the bill would establish minimum operational requirements for scrap metal facilities that operate shredders, in addition to all other requirements pertaining to recycling centers. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the prevention of the accumulation of shredder residue or scrap metal that would result in a risk of fire, the placement of shredder residue on impervious surfaces to control stormwater discharges, the enclosure of any shredder residue to prevent dust migration, and the implementation of fire suppression systems and associated training programs and inspection requirements. No later than 18 months after the bills effective date, the department would be required to establish a program to regulate each scrap metal facility in the State as a recycling center, in compliance with the bills provisions.  The bill would direct the department to hire a sufficient number of new staff to implement the bills provisions and provide that the department would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor for funding to implement the bills provisions. The bill would provide that a violation of the bills provisions would be considered a violation of the Solid Waste Management Act, P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), provide that the department would have the right to enter and inspect the premises of a scrap metal facility to determine compliance, and establish that an person who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement to the department on any registration or other application, record, or other document required to be filed or maintained by this bill would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and be subject to a civil administrative penalty of  up to $10,000.

(cf: P.L.2008, c.6, s.1) 9.  (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that the scrap metal recycling industry is a longstanding vital component of the State's overall recycling efforts that provides a key service in preventing scrap metal from entering the waste stream. b.  The Legislature further finds and declares that the burden of primarily regulating facilities that receive, store, process, and transfer scrap metal, including, but not limited to, automobiles or other source separated, non-putrescible ferrous and nonferrous metals has been shouldered by municipalities, with the unintended effect of inconsistent operational and environmental controls placed on these facilities throughout the State. c.  The Legislature further finds and declares that this inconsistent regulation has led to instances where scrap metal facilities may present significant public health and safety concerns, including, but not limited to, fires, dust and other airborne contaminants, polluted stormwater discharges, and other potential environmental and public health impacts associated with facility operations, and also creates unnecessary barriers to instituting consistent, Statewide requirements to mitigate these concerns. d.  The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest to require scrap metal facilities to be subject to regulation by the Department of Environmental Protection as recycling centers so that consistent and Statewide oversight may be implemented to minimize adverse impacts to public health and the environment. 10.  (New section)  As used in sections 11 through 15 of  P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Department means the Department of Environmental Protection. Recycling center means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). Scrap metal means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). Scrap metal facility means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.102 (C.13:1E-99.12). 11.  (New section)  a.  No later than one year after the effective date of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the owner or operator of each scrap metal facility shall register with the department.  The registration shall be submitted in a form and manner to be determined by the department and shall contain: (1) the name, ownership, contact information, and address of the scrap metal facility; (2) documentation of any local, State, or federal approvals obtained by the scrap metal facility; (3) the average weight and volume of scrap metal received at the scrap metal facility on a daily basis; (4) information concerning whether any processing, such as bailing, cutting, torching, crushing, or shredding is conducted at the scrap metal facility; and (5) a description on the types of materials that are processed at the scrap metal facility. b.  In submitting the registration required pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the operator of a scrap metal facility shall: (1) certify to the accuracy of the information submitted as a part of the registration process; and (2) pay a registration fee of $700 to the department. c.  The registration required pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be renewed annually, except that the department may extend the renewal deadline if the department determines that there is good cause to provide an extension. d.  The department may modify the amount of the registration fee to be imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section through the adoption of rules and regulations, provided that the registration fee only accounts for the reasonable costs of the department in administering the registration of scrap metal facilities pursuant to this section. e.  The department shall use the information received through the registrations required pursuant to subsection a. of this section to establish appropriate regulatory, operational, and management requirements for scrap metal facilities and to determine the appropriate class of recycling center permit, license, or approval that shall be required for scrap metal facility types, except that any scrap metal facility that operates a shredder shall require an individual recycling center permit of the class determined by the department. 12.  (New section)  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a scrap metal facility shall be subject to the same requirements as a recycling center, as established under applicable State and federal law. b.  In addition to all requirements pertaining to recycling centers, scrap metal facilities that operate shredders to process scrap metal shall: (1) prevent the accumulation of shredder residue, regardless of source, or scrap material within the confines of the facility of such volumes that would constitute a risk of fire; (2) put in place sufficient operational controls as necessary to ensure that no ignition sources, including spent batteries and spent or unspent lithium-ion batteries, or other electrical energy storage devices, consisting of one or more individual battery modules or cells, are shredded or otherwise processed; (3) ensure that any shredder residue on site is situated on an impervious surface, enclosed within a structure, or otherwise covered to prevent liquid runoff or stormwater discharges, and is subject to dust control technologies to limit the dispersal of fugitive dust; (4) install, maintain, and regularly test an approved fire suppression system, including measures specifically designed to suppress fires that may occur in or around stockpiles or other areas of accumulated scrap metal, or in the vicinity of processing equipment, including shredders.  An approved fire suppression system may include alarm systems, infrared heat sensors, fire retardant dispersal systems, fire breaks, as well as sufficient buffer spacing of at least 25 feet in width to facilitate emergency response and vehicle access throughout the facility.  The system shall meet the requirements of applicable fire codes and standards, and shall include automatic fire detection and suppression capabilities; and (5) train staff in the use of the fire suppression system, implemented pursuant to subparagraph (3) of this subsection at least annually and shall certify that installed fire suppression systems have been inspected by local fire officials as part of the facilitys annual reporting requirements, as established by the department. 13.  (New section)  a.  No later than 18 months after the effective date of P.L.       , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the department shall establish a program to regulate each scrap metal facility in the State as a recycling center, in compliance with the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.  The department shall hire a sufficient number of new employees as may be deemed necessary by the department to implement the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  All employees hired pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes. c.  The department shall include in its annual budget a request to the Governor the moneys necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The Legislature shall appropriate the necessary funds to the department for this purpose. 14.  (New section) a.  A violation of the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be considered a violation of the Solid Waste Management Act, P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), and the Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall have recourse to any of the actions or penalties provided for in section 9 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-9), in order to address the violation. b.  The department shall have the right to enter, at any time during normal business hours and upon presentation of appropriate credentials, the premises of a scrap metal facility in order to determine compliance with the provisions of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.  Any person who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement to the department on any registration or other application, record or other document required to be filed or maintained by P.L.       , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and be subject to a civil administrative penalty of not more than $10,000. 15.  (New section) The department shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations, as necessary to effectuate the purposes of P.L.       , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 16.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would replace the term scrap processing facility with scrap metal facility under applicable State laws and would require scrap metal facilities to register with Department of Environmental Protection (department) and comply with certain requirements established under the bill. The bill would amend existing law to remove the exemption to regulation of scrap processing facilities as recycling centers.  As defined in the bill, scrap metal facility means any facility that receives, stores, transfers, or processes scrap metal, including those that alter or reduce the volume or physical characteristics of scrap metal by mechanical methods, including but not limited to baling, cutting, torching, crushing, or shredding, for purposes of recycling, resale, or reuse, including for remelting, refining, smelting, or remanufacturing into raw materials or products, and includes what is commonly known as a scrapyard or junkyard. The bill would require, no later than one year after the bills effective date, the owner or operator of each scrap metal facility in the State to register with the department and pay a registration fee of $700 to the department.  The registration would be required to be renewed annually unless an extension is granted by the department.  The department would be required to use the information received through the registrations to establish appropriate regulatory, operational, and management requirements for scrap metal facilities and to determine the appropriate class of recycling center permit, license, or approval that would be required for scrap metal facility types, except that any scrap metal facility that operates a shredder would require an individual recycling center permit of the class determined by the department. In addition, the bill would establish minimum operational requirements for scrap metal facilities that operate shredders, in addition to all other requirements pertaining to recycling centers. These requirements include, but are not limited to, the prevention of the accumulation of shredder residue or scrap metal that would result in a risk of fire, the placement of shredder residue on impervious surfaces to control stormwater discharges, the enclosure of any shredder residue to prevent dust migration, and the implementation of fire suppression systems and associated training programs and inspection requirements. No later than 18 months after the bills effective date, the department would be required to establish a program to regulate each scrap metal facility in the State as a recycling center, in compliance with the bills provisions.  The bill would direct the department to hire a sufficient number of new staff to implement the bills provisions and provide that the department would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor for funding to implement the bills provisions. The bill would provide that a violation of the bills provisions would be considered a violation of the Solid Waste Management Act, P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), provide that the department would have the right to enter and inspect the premises of a scrap metal facility to determine compliance, and establish that an person who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement to the department on any registration or other application, record, or other document required to be filed or maintained by this bill would be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and be subject to a civil administrative penalty of  up to $10,000.
