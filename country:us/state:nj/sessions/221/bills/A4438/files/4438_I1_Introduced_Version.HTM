Section 1:
A4438 ASSEMBLY, No. 4438 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 20, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Assemblywoman  CLEOPATRA G. TUCKER District 28 (Essex and Union) Assemblyman  WILLIAM B. SAMPSON, IV District 31 (Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Matsikoudis SYNOPSIS Revises out-of-State reciprocity for elevator, escalator, and moving walkway mechanic's licenses. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning reciprocity for elevator, escalator, and moving walkway mechanic's licenses and amending P.L.2012, c.71. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 8 of P.L.2012, c.71 (C.45:14H-8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    The board may in its discretion grant licenses without examination to applicants so licensed by other states; provided that [equal reciprocity is provided for New Jersey licensed mechanics by the law of the applicant's domiciliary state and provided further that] the domiciliary state's standards are equal to or comparable to those of this State. (cf: P.L.2012, c.71, s.8) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill revises the rules concerning out-of-State reciprocity for elevator, escalator, and moving walkway mechanic's licenses. Current law provides that the Elevator, Escalator, and Moving Walkway Mechanics Licensing Board may in its discretion grant licenses without examination to applicants so licensed by other states; provided that equal reciprocity is provided for New Jersey licensed mechanics by the law of the applicant's domiciliary state and that the domiciliary state's standards are equal to or comparable to those of this State. This bill removes the requirement of equal reciprocity, thereby allowing the board to grant licenses without examination to applicants with comparable licenses in other states, provided that the domiciliary state's standards are equal to or comparable to those of this State, even if the domiciliary state does not provide reciprocity to New Jersey licensees.
