STANLEY District 18 (Middlesex) Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Requires contractors compliance with federal requirement regarding lead-based paint. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning contractors compliance with the federal requirement regarding lead-based paint and supplementing P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-136 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    A contractor business required to register under the Contractors Business Registration Act, P.L.2004, c.16 (C.56:8-136 et seq.) shall demonstrate compliance with 40 C.F.R. 745, Subpart E, as adopted as of the date this act is signed into law, at the time of initial business registration with the State and when filing a registration renewal or reinstatement if the contractor business employs contractors who perform renovations, repairs, or painting that disturb lead-based paint in homes built before 1978. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the twelfth month next following enactment. STATEMENT Currently, the federal government requires contractors to be certified through a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) program or an EPA-approved state program to perform renovations, repairs, and painting which may disturb lead-based paint in homes built before 1978.  This bill codifies that requirement for New Jersey-registered contractor businesses if the business employs contractors who perform that type of work.  The bill requires those contractors businesses to demonstrate compliance with the certification requirement when applying for initial registration and for registration renewal or reinstatement.  The requirement was developed as a result of the Toxic Substance Control Act, 15 U.S.C. 2682 and 2686, addressing lead-based paint and lead abatement. According to medical research, children are able to absorb lead more easily than adults, particularly through lead-contaminated dust or paint, which can cause serious health issues in both childhood and adulthood.
