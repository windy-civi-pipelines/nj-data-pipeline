The bill defines a densely or highly populated municipality as a municipality with a population density of at least 5,000 persons per square mile or a population of at least 35,000 persons; a densely populated county as a county with a population density of at least 5,000 persons per square mile; and a highly populated county as a county with a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile. The projects listed in the bill have been approved by the DEP and the Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT). To the extent that there are funds remaining after the local government unit projects listed in this bill are offered funding, the bill also authorizes the DEP, with the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee (JBOC), to use those funds to provide additional funding for local government unit projects listed in this bill, as well as for local government unit projects previously approved for funding pursuant to various other laws.

There is reappropriated to the Department of Environmental Protection the unexpended balances, due to project withdrawals, cancellations, or cost savings, of the amounts appropriated or reappropriated from any Green Acres bond act, any annual appropriations act, or the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund to assist local government units to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes, for the purposes of providing: (1)   grants or loans, or both, to assist local government units to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes, for projects approved as eligible for such funding pursuant to this act; and (2)   additional funding, as determined by the Department of Environmental Protection, to any project of a local government unit that previously received funding appropriated or reappropriated from any Green Acres bond act, any annual appropriations act, or the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund for recreation and conservation purposes or that receives funding approved pursuant to this act, subject to the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee or its successor.  Any such additional funding provided from a Green Acres bond act may include administrative costs. b.    There is appropriated to the Department of Environmental Protection such sums as may be, or may become, available on or before June 30, 2024, due to interest earnings or loan repayments in any "Green Trust Fund" established pursuant to a Green Acres bond act or in the "Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund," for the purpose of providing: (1)   grants or loans, or both, to assist local government units to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes, for projects approved as eligible for such funding pursuant to this act; and (2)   additional funding, as determined by the Department of Environmental Protection, to any project of a local government unit that previously received funding appropriated or reappropriated from any Green Acres bond act, any annual appropriations act, or the Garden State Green Acres Preservation Trust Fund for recreation and conservation purposes or that receives funding approved pursuant to this act, subject to the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee or its successor.

STATEMENT This bill appropriates $101,696,535 from constitutionally dedicated corporation business tax (CBT) revenues, and various Green Acres funds to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Of the total amount appropriated by the bill, $99,286,535 would be used by the DEP to provide grants or loans, or both, to assist local government units in the State to acquire or develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes, and $2,410,000 would be used for the DEPs associated administrative costs.  Of the total amount appropriated by the bill, $24,321,885 is allocated for projects to acquire lands for recreation and conservation purposes, as identified in section 4 of the bill, and $74,964,650 is allocated for projects to develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes, as identified in section 5 of the bill. Of the $24,321,885 sum being appropriated for projects to acquire lands for recreation and conservation purposes:  $20,766,435 is allocated for planning incentive open space acquisition projects (i.e., projects located in municipalities and counties that have an open space tax and an approved open space plan); $1,437,500 is allocated for standard open space acquisition projects (i.e., projects located in municipalities that do not have an open space tax); $459,950 is allocated for site-specific incentive acquisition projects (i.e., projects located in municipalities that have an open space tax, but do not have an open space plan); and $1,658,000 is allocated for urban aid acquisition projects. Of the $74,964,650 sum being appropriated for projects to develop lands for recreation and conservation purposes:  $29,429,150 is allocated for local park development projects in urban aid municipalities or sponsored by densely populated counties; $7,556,770 is allocated for local park development projects in densely or highly populated municipalities or sponsored by highly populated counties; $3,072,700 is allocated for standard local park development projects (i.e., projects located in municipalities that do not meet the criteria of the prior two categories); $1,758,610 is allocated for stewardship activity projects; and $33,147,420 is allocated for completely inclusive playground projects, pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2018, c.104 (C.13:8C-27.1), otherwise known as Jakes Law.  While Green Acres funding for Jakes Law purposes has, in prior funding rounds, been made available only to eligible counties, in the current funding round, both counties and municipalities are eligible for non-competitive grant awards for completely inclusive playground projects thereunder. The bill defines a densely or highly populated municipality as a municipality with a population density of at least 5,000 persons per square mile or a population of at least 35,000 persons; a densely populated county as a county with a population density of at least 5,000 persons per square mile; and a highly populated county as a county with a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile. The projects listed in the bill have been approved by the DEP and the Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT). To the extent that there are funds remaining after the local government unit projects listed in this bill are offered funding, the bill also authorizes the DEP, with the approval of the Joint Budget Oversight Committee (JBOC), to use those funds to provide additional funding for local government unit projects listed in this bill, as well as for local government unit projects previously approved for funding pursuant to various other laws.
