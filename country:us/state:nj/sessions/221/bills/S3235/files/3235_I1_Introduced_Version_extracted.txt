STATEMENT This bill regulates the production and sale of intoxicating hemp products. Agency Responsibilities Under current law, three entities within the State maintain jurisdiction over the cannabis plant.  The Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission) regulates adult-use and medical cannabis, the Department of Agriculture (department) regulates hemp, and the Attorney General (AG) enforces criminal penalties against illegal marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The bill synchronizes the definitions of hemp, hemp products, and THC in order to regulate the sale of intoxicating hemp products.  By means of updating the definitions of hemp, hemp products, and THC, and adding a definition of intoxicating hemp products, the bill clarifies the role of each agency.  The commission would be responsible for regulating the sale of all legally produced intoxicating cannabis items, whether hemp or cannabis; the department would continue to regulate the cultivation and processing of hemp as an agricultural commodity; and the AG would maintain the jurisdiction over illegally produced marijuana and THC, including any businesses or individuals who fail to sell cannabis items through a licensed retailer. Licensing and Compliance Pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35, and through the amended definition of cannabis item to include intoxicating hemp product, the commission is required to promulgate regulations related to the sale and purchase of cannabis items.  Further, pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-42, an entity is required to be licensed as a Class 5 Cannabis Retailer in order to operate a business in which cannabis items are retailed.  Thus, in order to sell an intoxicating hemp product, the business is required to be a Class 5 licensee and is subject to product testing, labeling requirements, and limitations on the sale of products to persons of a certain age as established by the commission. Intoxicating hemp product is defined as any product cultivated, derived, or manufactured from hemp regulated pursuant to the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, Pub.L.115-334 or the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (N.J.S.A.4:28-6 et al.) that is sold in this State that has a concentration of total THC greater than 0.5 milligrams per serving or 2.5 milligrams per package.  Intoxicating hemp product does not include a cannabinoid product that is not derived from naturally occurring biologically active chemical constituents and shall not include hemp products as newly defined under this bill in the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.). Legal Framework Amendments Further, the bill amends the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.), to set limits on the amount of THC that can be sold in hemp or hemp products.  This limit is set at a total THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis and additionally, for a hemp product, not more than 0.5 milligrams of total THC per serving, and 2.5 milligrams of total THC per package.  Total THC is defined as the total concentration of all tetrahydrocannabinols in a cannabis item, including delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and any other chemically similar compound, substance, derivative, or isomer of tetrahydrocannabinol, regardless of how derived or manufactured, and any other cannabinoid, other than cannabidiol, identified by the commission, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and the Attorney General, as causing intoxication.  This definitional change clarifies the departments role in the regulation of hemp, and limits it to hemp or hemp products that meet the limitations established in the bill. The bill also clarifies the definition of THC in the Schedule I controlled dangerous substance statute, N.J.S.A.24:21-5, to ensure THC produced by way of manufacture, and which is not produced or sold in accordance with the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.), or the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, (CREAMMA) P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) is included on the Schedule I list.  N.J.S.A.24:21-2 defines manufacture to mean the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion, or processing of a controlled dangerous substance, either directly or by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of the substance or labeling or relabeling of its container, except that this term does not include the preparation or compounding of a controlled dangerous substance by an individual for the individual's own use or the preparation, compounding, packaging, or labeling of a controlled dangerous substance: (1) by a practitioner as an incident to the practitioner's administering or dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance in the course of the practitioner's professional practice, or (2) by a practitioner, or under the practitioner's supervision, for the purpose of, or as an incident to, research, teaching, or chemical analysis and not for sale. Unlicensed Sale and Penalties Under the bill, a person is prohibited from selling or distributing a hemp product unless the person is licensed by the commission and the product complies with CREAMMA and any commission regulations.  Further, it is unlawful to sell or distribute a hemp product or cannabis item that is not derived from naturally occurring biologically active chemical constituents. Under the bill, it is unlawful, except as otherwise provided by law, to sell or distribute a product that contains THC to any person under the age of 21. The bill establishes the penalties for an owner or operator of a business who sells an intoxicating hemp product in violation of the bill.  The penalties are as follows: (1) for a first offense, a fine of not less than $100; (2)   for a second offense, a fine of not less than $1,000; and (3) for a third offense, a fine of not less than $10,000. Each product sold in violation of this bill constituents an additional separate and distinct offense. Enforcement and Education The bill also permits an official authorized by statute or ordinance, or State or local health codes or consumer protection laws, or a law enforcement office having enforcement authority in that municipality to issue the summons for any alleged violation of the bill. Finally, the bill requires the commission, in consultation with the Division of Consumer Affairs, and the Business Action Center in the Department of State, to develop and implement a public education program for businesses across the State on the bill.

STATEMENT This bill regulates the production and sale of intoxicating hemp products. Agency Responsibilities Under current law, three entities within the State maintain jurisdiction over the cannabis plant.  The Cannabis Regulatory Commission (commission) regulates adult-use and medical cannabis, the Department of Agriculture (department) regulates hemp, and the Attorney General (AG) enforces criminal penalties against illegal marijuana and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The bill synchronizes the definitions of hemp, hemp products, and THC in order to regulate the sale of intoxicating hemp products.  By means of updating the definitions of hemp, hemp products, and THC, and adding a definition of intoxicating hemp products, the bill clarifies the role of each agency.  The commission would be responsible for regulating the sale of all legally produced intoxicating cannabis items, whether hemp or cannabis; the department would continue to regulate the cultivation and processing of hemp as an agricultural commodity; and the AG would maintain the jurisdiction over illegally produced marijuana and THC, including any businesses or individuals who fail to sell cannabis items through a licensed retailer. Licensing and Compliance Pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-35, and through the amended definition of cannabis item to include intoxicating hemp product, the commission is required to promulgate regulations related to the sale and purchase of cannabis items.  Further, pursuant to N.J.S.A.24:6I-42, an entity is required to be licensed as a Class 5 Cannabis Retailer in order to operate a business in which cannabis items are retailed.  Thus, in order to sell an intoxicating hemp product, the business is required to be a Class 5 licensee and is subject to product testing, labeling requirements, and limitations on the sale of products to persons of a certain age as established by the commission. Intoxicating hemp product is defined as any product cultivated, derived, or manufactured from hemp regulated pursuant to the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, Pub.L.115-334 or the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (N.J.S.A.4:28-6 et al.) that is sold in this State that has a concentration of total THC greater than 0.5 milligrams per serving or 2.5 milligrams per package.  Intoxicating hemp product does not include a cannabinoid product that is not derived from naturally occurring biologically active chemical constituents and shall not include hemp products as newly defined under this bill in the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.). Legal Framework Amendments Further, the bill amends the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.), to set limits on the amount of THC that can be sold in hemp or hemp products.  This limit is set at a total THC concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis and additionally, for a hemp product, not more than 0.5 milligrams of total THC per serving, and 2.5 milligrams of total THC per package.  Total THC is defined as the total concentration of all tetrahydrocannabinols in a cannabis item, including delta-8, delta-9, delta-10, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid and any other chemically similar compound, substance, derivative, or isomer of tetrahydrocannabinol, regardless of how derived or manufactured, and any other cannabinoid, other than cannabidiol, identified by the commission, in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and the Attorney General, as causing intoxication.  This definitional change clarifies the departments role in the regulation of hemp, and limits it to hemp or hemp products that meet the limitations established in the bill. The bill also clarifies the definition of THC in the Schedule I controlled dangerous substance statute, N.J.S.A.24:21-5, to ensure THC produced by way of manufacture, and which is not produced or sold in accordance with the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act, P.L.2019, c.238 (C.4:28-6 et seq.), or the Cannabis Regulatory, Enforcement Assistance, and Marketplace Modernization Act, (CREAMMA) P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.) is included on the Schedule I list.  N.J.S.A.24:21-2 defines manufacture to mean the production, preparation, propagation, compounding, conversion, or processing of a controlled dangerous substance, either directly or by extraction from substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical synthesis, or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis, and includes any packaging or repackaging of the substance or labeling or relabeling of its container, except that this term does not include the preparation or compounding of a controlled dangerous substance by an individual for the individual's own use or the preparation, compounding, packaging, or labeling of a controlled dangerous substance: (1) by a practitioner as an incident to the practitioner's administering or dispensing of a controlled dangerous substance in the course of the practitioner's professional practice, or (2) by a practitioner, or under the practitioner's supervision, for the purpose of, or as an incident to, research, teaching, or chemical analysis and not for sale. Unlicensed Sale and Penalties Under the bill, a person is prohibited from selling or distributing a hemp product unless the person is licensed by the commission and the product complies with CREAMMA and any commission regulations.  Further, it is unlawful to sell or distribute a hemp product or cannabis item that is not derived from naturally occurring biologically active chemical constituents. Under the bill, it is unlawful, except as otherwise provided by law, to sell or distribute a product that contains THC to any person under the age of 21. The bill establishes the penalties for an owner or operator of a business who sells an intoxicating hemp product in violation of the bill.  The penalties are as follows: (1) for a first offense, a fine of not less than $100; (2)   for a second offense, a fine of not less than $1,000; and (3) for a third offense, a fine of not less than $10,000. Each product sold in violation of this bill constituents an additional separate and distinct offense. Enforcement and Education The bill also permits an official authorized by statute or ordinance, or State or local health codes or consumer protection laws, or a law enforcement office having enforcement authority in that municipality to issue the summons for any alleged violation of the bill. Finally, the bill requires the commission, in consultation with the Division of Consumer Affairs, and the Business Action Center in the Department of State, to develop and implement a public education program for businesses across the State on the bill.
