(8)   Not more than 50 milligrams of morphine or any of its salts per 100 milliliters or per 100 grams with one or more active, nonnarcotic ingredients in recognized therapeutic amounts. g.    The director may by regulation except any compound, mixture, or preparation containing any stimulant or depressant substance listed in subsections c. and d. of this schedule from the application of all or any part of this act if the compound, mixture, or preparation contains one or more active medicinal ingredients not having a stimulant or depressant effect on the central nervous system; provided, that such admixtures shall be included therein in such combinations, quantity, proportion, or concentration as to vitiate the potential for abuse of the substances which do have a stimulant or depressant effect on the central nervous system. (cf: P.L.2007, c.244, s.5) 2.    (New section) The Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to implement the provisions of this act. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill classifies xylazine as a Schedule III controlled dangerous substance (CDS), except when it is acquired, prescribed, administered, or dispensed by a veterinarian in the course of the professional practice of veterinary medicine. Drugs listed as Schedule III CDS that do not otherwise carry a specific criminal penalty are subject to certain standard criminal penalties related to the illegal manufacturing, distribution, dispensing, possession, and use of the drug. Accordingly, a person convicted of the illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, use, or being under the influence of xylazine would be guilty of a crime of the third degree, which is punishable by imprisonment for three to five years, as well as a fine of up to $25,000 in the case of manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing offenses, and a fine of up to $35,000 for possession, use, or intoxication offenses.  Certain enhanced penalties would apply for offenses committed within 1,000 feet of school property, for offenses committed within 500 feet of certain public spaces, and for distributing xylaxine to a person under 18 years of age or who is pregnant. Xylazine, which is also known by the street names tranq, tranq dope, and zombie drug, has been approved for use as an animal sedative and is commonly used in veterinary practice, but has not been approved for use in humans.  However, it has been reported that xylazine has been increasingly detected in illegal street drugs, and particularly in opioid drugs, as it can enhance and prolong the euphoric effects of opioids.  However, xylazine is not itself an opioid, and it does not respond to opioid antidotes like naloxone.  Accordingly, a person who consumes an opioid drug that includes xylazine may die of an overdose notwithstanding the prompt administration of an opioid antidote.  Furthermore, xylazine is highly addictive, results in severe withdrawal symptoms, and can cause severe skin ulcers and abscesses.  Although some drug users seek out xylazine for its effects in enhancing opioid intoxication, others may not be aware they are consuming it or that they are at enhanced risk of overdose and other drug-related injuries. It is the sponsors belief that listing xylazine as a Schedule III CDS, except when it is being used in the course of practicing veterinary medicine, will help protect the lives of New Jersey citizens and prevent unnecessary deaths.
