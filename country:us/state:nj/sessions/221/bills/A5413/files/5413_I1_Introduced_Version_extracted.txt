(5)   Fees established pursuant to this subsection shall be dedicated to meeting the costs of implementing and enforcing this subsection and shall not be used for any other purpose. c.     Notwithstanding subsection b. of this section to the contrary, a dwelling unit shall not be subject to inspection and evaluation for the presence of lead-based paint hazards if the unit: (1)   has been certified to be free of lead-based paint; (2)   was constructed during or after 1978; (3)   is in a multiple-family building that has been registered with the Department of Community Affairs as a multiple family building for at least 10 years, either under the current or a previous owner, and has no outstanding lead-based paint violations from the two most recent cyclical inspections performed under the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.); (4)   is a single-family or two-family seasonal rental dwelling which is rented for less than six months duration each year by tenants that do not have consecutive lease renewals; or (5)   has a valid lead-safe certification issued in accordance with this section. d.  (1)  If a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency finds that a lead-based paint hazard exists in a dwelling unit upon conducting an inspection pursuant to this section, then the owner of the dwelling unit shall remediate the lead-based paint hazard by using abatement or lead-based paint hazard control methods, approved in accordance with the provisions of the "Lead Hazard Control Assistance Act," P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.1 et al.).  Upon the remediation of the lead-based paint hazard, the lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency shall conduct an additional inspection of the unit to certify that the hazard no longer exists. (2)   If a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency finds that no lead-based paint hazards exist in a dwelling unit upon conducting an inspection pursuant to this section or following remediation of a lead-based paint hazard pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency shall certify the dwelling unit as lead-safe on a form prescribed by the Department of Community Affairs, as provided for in regulations or guidance promulgated pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.20), and no future inspection of the dwelling unit shall be required.  [The lead-safe certification provided to the property owner by the lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid for three years.] e.     Beginning on the effective date of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.16 et al.), property owners shall: (1)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2024, c.74) (2)   provide evidence of a valid lead-safe certification obtained pursuant to this section to new tenants of the property at the time of tenant turnover unless not required to have had an inspection by a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection c. of this section and shall affix a copy of such certification as an exhibit to the tenant's or tenants' lease; and (3)   maintain a record of the lead-safe certification which shall include the name or names of the unit's tenant or tenants, if the inspection was conducted during a period of tenancy, unless not required to have had an inspection by a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection c. of this section. f.     Each municipality shall deliver to the Department of Community Affairs a list identifying each dwelling unit inspected pursuant to this section and each dwelling unit determined to contain a lead-based paint hazard.  The department shall, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), submit an annual report to the Legislature indicating the number of inspected dwelling units identified to have lead-based paint hazards.  The report shall list the number of inspected dwellings and dwelling units identified to have lead-based paint hazards within each county. g.    (1)  If a dwelling is located in a municipality in which less than three percent of children tested, six years of age or younger, have a blood lead reference value greater than or equal to five ug/dL or any other blood lead level adopted by the Department of Health, according to the central lead screening database maintained by the Department of Health pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1995, c.328 (C.26:2-137.6), or according to other data deemed appropriate by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, then a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency may inspect for lead-based paint hazards through visual assessment.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs may determine an appropriate blood lead reference value on the basis of multiple years of data. (2)   If a dwelling unit is located in a municipality in which at least three percent of children tested, six years of age or younger, have a blood lead reference value greater than or equal to five ug/dL or any other blood lead level adopted by the Department of Health, according to the central lead screening database maintained by the Department of Health pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1995, c.328 (C.26:2-137.6), or according to other data deemed appropriate by the  Commissioner of Community Affairs, then a lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency shall inspect for lead-based paint hazards through dust wipe sampling.  The Commissioner of Community Affairs may determine an appropriate blood lead reference value on the basis of multiple years of data.  The disclosure of this data for the purposes of this section shall not constitute the disclosure of the identity of a child pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1995, c.328 (C.26:2-137.6). (3)   If a lead hazard is identified in an inspection of one of the dwelling units in a building consisting of two- or three-dwelling units, then the lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency shall inspect the remainder of the building's dwelling units for lead hazards, with the exception of dwelling units that have been certified to be lead-safe.  The lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency may charge fees in accordance with this section for such additional inspections. (4)   If a dwelling owner or landlord directly hires a lead evaluation contractor who is certified to provide lead paint inspection services by the Department of Community Affairs to complete the inspection required under paragraph (1) of this subsection, then the owner may elect to have the inspection performed through dust wipes in lieu of visual examination. h.    In addition to the fees permitted to be charged for inspection of rental housing pursuant to this section, each municipality shall assess an additional fee of $20 per unit inspected by a certified lead evaluation contractor or permanent local agency for the purposes of the "Lead Hazard Control Assistance Act," P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.1 et al.) concerning lead hazard control work, unless the unit owner demonstrates that the Department of Community Affairs has already assessed an additional inspection fee of $20 pursuant to the provisions of section 10 of P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.10).  In a planned real estate development, any inspection fee charged pursuant to this subsection shall be the responsibility of the unit owner and not the homeowners' association, unless the association is the owner of the unit.  The fees collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited into the "Lead Hazard Control Assistance Fund" established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.4). (cf: P.L.2024, c.74, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill limits the frequency of lead inspections of certain apartments subject to the requirements of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.16 et al.). Current law requires a municipality to cause the inspection of rental dwelling units and, in a building consisting of two or three dwelling units, common areas, for lead-based paint hazards at tenant turnover or within three years of the effective date of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.16 et al.).  Thereafter, the municipality is to cause the inspection at tenant turnover or every three years, whichever is earlier, except that an inspection upon tenant turnover is not required if the owner has received a valid lead-safe certification pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.16). This bill provides that no future inspection is required if the owner has received a valid lead-safe certification pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection d. of P.L.2021, c.182 (C.52:27D-437.16).  Further, the bill provides that if the initial inspection locates a lead-based paint hazard, the reinspection and associated costs are to be limited to the duration and scope of the previous inspection, which located the lead-based paint hazard.
