of any supervision or control by the department or any board or officer
thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The purpose of the board

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The public members shall
serve for three-year terms.  Of the public members first appointed, four shall
serve for a period of two years, and three shall serve for a term of three
years.  Vacancies in the membership of the board shall be filled in the same
manner as the original appointments were made.  The public members shall serve
without compensation but may be reimbursed for necessary and reasonable
expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The board shall organize
as soon as may be practicable after the appointment of its members and shall
select a chairperson from among the members.  The members shall select a
secretary, who need not be a member of the board.</p>

the assistance and services of the employees of any State department, board,
bureau, commission, or agency as it may require and as may be available for the
purposes of reviewing a case pursuant to this act.  The board may also seek the
advice of experts specializing the in fields of forensic medicine, psychiatry,
psychology, social work, law enforcement, family law, or other fields, if the

identify all overdose fatalities and near fatalities involving controlled
substances or controlled substance analogs that occur in the State of New

teams to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatalities and near
fatalities identified by the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  Each team shall include,
at a minimum, a person experienced in prosecution, a person experienced in law
enforcement investigation, a person experienced in drug addiction and substance
use disorder treatment, a medical examiner, a forensic pathologist, and a
physician.  As necessary to perform its functions, each team may add additional
members or seek the advice of experts in other fields if the facts of a case
warrant additional expertise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Each team shall submit to
the board chairperson a report of its findings and recommendations based upon
its review of each overdose fatality or near fatality.</p>
