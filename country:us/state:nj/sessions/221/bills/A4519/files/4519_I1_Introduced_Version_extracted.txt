CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning adults with developmental disabilities and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  a.  Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, upon the sale of a State-owned property used by a nonprofit agency or organization contracted with the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services for at least 10 years to provide housing for adults with developmental disabilities: (1) the division shall allow the agency or organization to pay off any lien placed against the property at a rate of 50 percent; and (2) the Department of the Treasury shall transfer any revenues or proceeds from the sale of the property to the agency or organization. b.  If any lien placed against the property is paid off by the agency or organization at the rate of 50 percent pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the Department of the Treasury is authorized to file with clerk of the county, register of deeds and mortgages, or clerk of the Superior Court, as appropriate, a duly acknowledged certificate or warrant setting forth the departments request to discharge the remaining portion of the lien. c.  The revenues or proceeds from the sale of a State-owned property transferred by the Department of the Treasury to the nonprofit agency or organization pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section shall be used by the agency or organization to: (1) purchase a new property or renovate an existing property to provide housing for adults with developmental disabilities; or (2) expand or improve the services provided by the agency to adults with developmental disabilities. 2.  The Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Department of Human Services, shall promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill stipulates that upon the sale of a State-owned property used by a nonprofit agency or organization contracted with the Division of Developmental Disabilities (the division) for at least 10 years to provide housing for adults with developmental disabilities: (1) the division is to allow the agency or organization to pay off any lien placed against the property at a rate of 50 percent; and (2) the Department of the Treasury (the department) transfer any revenues or proceeds from the sale of the property to the agency or organization. If any lien placed against the property is paid off by the agency or organization at the rate of 50 percent, the department is authorized to file a duly acknowledged certificate or warrant setting forth the departments request to discharge the remaining portion of the lien. The bill also requires that the revenues or proceeds from the sale of a State-owned property transferred by the department to the nonprofit agency or organization are to be used by the agency or organization to:  (1) purchase a new property or renovate an existing property to provide housing for adults with developmental disabilities; or (2) expand or improve the services provided by the agency or organization to adults with developmental disabilities. Currently, when a non-profit agency or organization contracted with the division to provide housing to adults with developmental disabilities wants to sell the home where such adults reside, the division requires that all proceeds from the sale must be returned to the State because the home is a State-owned property.  In addition, any lien placed on the home must also be paid in full by the agency or organization. This is a significant hurdle for providers who wish to purchase a new property or renovate an existing property to expand residential options for adults with disabilities in need of housing. This bill would remove some of the financial obstacles that would prevent a non-profit agency or organization providing housing to adults with developmental disabilities from selling State-owned property by reducing the pay-off amount of any lien placed against the property and allowing the agency or organization to use the proceeds of the sale to improve the property on which and expand and the services it provides to adults with disabilities.
