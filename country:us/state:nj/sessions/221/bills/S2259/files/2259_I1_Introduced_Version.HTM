c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    As an alternative to the
mandatory coverages provided in sections 3 and 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3
and 39:6A-4), any owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally
garaged in this State may elect a basic automobile insurance policy providing
the following coverage:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Personal injury
protection coverage, for the payment of benefits without regard to negligence,
liability or fault of any kind, to the named insured and members of his family
residing in his household, who sustained bodily injury as a result of an
accident while occupying, entering into, alighting from or using an automobile,
or as a pedestrian, caused by an automobile or by an object propelled by or
from an automobile, and to other persons sustaining bodily injury while
occupying, entering into, alighting from or using the automobile of the named
insured, with the permission of the named insured. &quot;Personal injury
protection coverage&quot; issued pursuant to this section means and includes
payment of medical expense benefits, as provided in the policy and approved by
the commissioner, for the reasonable and necessary treatment of bodily injury
in an amount <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>not
to exceed $15,000<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>of $250,000</u> per person per accident<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>;
except that, medical expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed
$250,000: (1) for all medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant
brain injury, spinal cord injury or disfigurement or (2) for medically necessary
treatment of other permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma
center or acute care hospital immediately following the accident and until the
patient is stable, no longer requires critical care and can be safely
discharged or transferred to another facility in the judgment of the attending
physician<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>. 
In the event benefits paid by an insurer pursuant to this subsection are in
excess of $75,000 on account of personal injury to any one person in any one
accident covered by a policy issued or renewed prior to January 1, 2004, such
excess shall be paid by the insurer and shall be reimbursable to the insurer
from the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1977,
c.310 (C.39:6-73.1). Benefits provided under basic coverage shall be in
accordance with a benefit plan provided in the policy and approved by the
commissioner.  The policy form, which shall be subject to the approval of the
commissioner, shall set forth the benefits provided under the policy, including
eligible medical treatments, diagnostic tests and services as well as such
other benefits as the policy may provide.  The commissioner shall set forth by
regulation a statement of the basic benefits which shall be included in the
policy.  Medical treatments, diagnostic tests, and services provided by the
policy shall be rendered in accordance with commonly accepted protocols and
professional standards and practices which are commonly accepted as being
beneficial for the treatment of the covered injury. Protocols and professional
standards and practices which are deemed to be commonly accepted pursuant to
this section shall be those recognized by national standard setting
organizations, national or state professional organizations of the same
discipline as the treating provider, or those designated or approved by the
commissioner in consultation with the professional licensing boards in the
Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. The
commissioner, in consultation with the Commissioner of <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the Department
of<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
Health <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and
Senior Services<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
and the applicable licensing boards, may reject the use of protocols, standards
and practices or lists of diagnostic tests set by any organization deemed not
to have standing or general recognition by the provider community or the
applicable licensing boards. Protocols shall be deemed to establish guidelines
as to standard appropriate treatment and diagnostic tests for injuries
sustained in automobile accidents, but the establishment of standard treatment
protocols or protocols for the administration of diagnostic tests shall not be
interpreted in such a manner as to preclude variance from the standard when
warranted by reason of medical necessity.  The policy form may provide for the
precertification of certain procedures, treatments, diagnostic tests, or other
services or for the purchase of durable medical goods, as approved by the
commissioner, provided that the requirement for precertification shall not be
unreasonable, and no precertification requirement shall apply within ten days
of the insured event.  The policy may provide that certain benefits provided by
the policy which are in excess of the basic benefits required by the
commissioner to be included in the policy may be subject to reasonable
copayments in addition to the copayments provided for herein, provided that the
copayments shall not be unreasonable and shall be established in such a manner
as not to serve to encourage underutilization of benefits subject to the
copayments, nor encourage overutilization of benefits.  The policy form shall clearly
set forth any limitations on benefits or exclusions, which may include, but
need not be limited to, benefits which are otherwise compensable under workers'
compensation, or benefits for treatments deemed to be experimental or
investigational, or benefits deducted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1972, c.70
(C.39:6A-6).  The commissioner may enlist the services of a benefit consultant
in establishing the basic benefits level provided in this subsection, which
shall be set forth by regulation no later than 120 days following the enactment
date of this amendatory and supplementary act.  The commissioner shall not
