The department may impose and collect fees from applicants for licensure and authorization under this section. (2)  Licensure and authorization of a business entity as a private plan review agency shall include, but not be limited to, consideration of the qualifications of the management and technical personnel of the business entity, the fiscal integrity of the business entity, and the ability of the business entity to perform expedited plan reviews within the requisite time frames in a manner sufficient to ensure that the plan review is performed in accordance with the code and with the requirements of other applicable laws and ordinances.

(cf: P.L.2015, c.146, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect in the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment, however, the commissioner shall immediately commence the process of promulgating rules and regulations. STATEMENT This bill establishes an alternate expedited plan review process under the State Uniform Construction Code Act.  Under the bill, an applicant for a construction permit may opt to pay a premium fee to have review and approval of the plans and specifications submitted together with the application for the permit performed on an expedited basis, within ten calendar days of the date of submission of the permit application.  The premium fee would be $500 for each required plan review subcode area.  The applicant would make this option at the time of submitting a permit application. A municipality may offer expedited plan reviews by its construction code enforcing agency.  If a municipality does not offer in-house expedited plan reviews, a construction permit applicant may retain any properly licensed private plan review agency to perform an expedited plan review. Because the local enforcing agency would retain supervisory control over the construction project, and retain the obligation and authority to issue the certificate of occupancy upon completion of the project, the bill provides for a bifurcation of the construction permit fees.  Under the bill, a local enforcing agency would retain the generally applicable fees and the private plan review agency would receive the expedited plan review premium fee.  The bill requires and empowers the Department of Community Affairs to develop and implement rules and regulations establishing program details, which would include a licensure program for businesses that want to privately perform expedited plan reviews.
