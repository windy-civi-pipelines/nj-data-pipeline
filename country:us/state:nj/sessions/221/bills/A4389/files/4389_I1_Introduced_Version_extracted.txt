STATEMENT This bill expands Megan's Law to require that members of municipal governing bodies be notified when a sex offender moves into a municipality and restricts sex offenders from residing in areas frequented by children. Under the provisions of the bill, when a sex offender listed on the Internet registry maintained by the Superintendent of the State Police registers with the chief law enforcement officer of a municipality, the officer is to forward the name and address of the sex offender to the members of the governing body of the municipality.  If the sex offender is required to register with the Superintendent of State Police because he is moving to a municipality that does not have a police force, then the Superintendent of State Police is to forward the sex offender's name and address to the members of the governing body of the municipality in which the sex offender intends to reside. Under the provisions of the bill, it is unlawful for a person who is subject to the Megan's Law registration requirements for a sex offense against an individual under the age of 18 to reside within 500 feet of an elementary or secondary school, playground or child care center.  The residential ban would not cover a sex offender who: resides at a prison or mental health facility; resides at a residence established before the bill's enactment; has a school, playground or child care center established or built within 500 feet of his or her existing residence; was granted a needs based exception by the parole board; or was discharged from a psychiatric facility by a court and was granted an exemption by a court.
