<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
Behavioral Health Crisis Mobile Response Act, requires the Commissioner of
Human Services (the commissioner), in consultation with the Commissioner of
Health, and the Directors of the Division of Mental Health and Addiction
Services, and the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of
Human Services (DHS), to establish a Statewide mobile crisis response system to
provide immediate crisis response services, and ongoing stabilization
management services, upon request, to adults with disabilities (i.e., with
intellectual or developmental disabilities, or mental illness) who are
experiencing a behavioral health crisis, and their families and attendant
caregivers or other staff.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The mobile crisis response
system would be designed to prevent the hospitalization of adults in crisis to
provide for the stabilization of adults in crisis in the least restrictive
environment, and to allow the mobile crisis response system to access to the
9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis hotline in order to refer
an eligible adult for crisis response services and stabilization management
services in accordance with the provisions of the bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The system would be
implemented on a Statewide basis, with at least one mobile crisis response
agency available to provide crisis response services and stabilization
management services, and at least one temporary stabilization unit available to
provide temporary crisis beds, in each of the northern, central, and southern
regions of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person, group, or entity
wishing to provide initial crisis response services or stabilization management
services, pursuant to this bills provisions, would need to be approved by the
New Jersey Medicaid and FamilyCare programs, and by the DHS, as a mobile
response agency.  Each mobile crisis response agency approved under the bill
would be required to employ one or more mobile crisis response teams, composed
of mental health professionals, to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    provide mobile crisis
response services in the home of a person in crisis, or at another community
location where a person in crisis is located; 2) when deemed to be appropriate,
transport the adult in crisis to a temporary stabilization unit established and
licensed pursuant to the bill; and 3)                provide ongoing stabilization
management services to the adult in crisis, in the adults home, when
authorized to do so by the DHS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Mobile crisis response
services and stabilization management services, which are provided by a mobile
crisis response team under this bills provisions, are to be delivered directly
by, or under the supervision of, a licensed and experienced psychiatrist.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Mobile crisis response
services are to be provided to an eligible adult in crisis for a period of up
to 72 hours per crisis episode, over the course of up to a four-day period,
immediately following the initial referral or dispatch, and are to be designed
to stabilize the presenting behaviors and crisis situation, with the goal of
preventing a disruption of the current living arrangement, and avoiding
inappropriate psychiatric hospitalization or residential placement, of the
adult in crisis.  Each referral to, or dispatch of, a mobile crisis response
team will be registered with the DHS within 24 hours after the team receives
notice thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Mobile crisis response
services provided by a mobile crisis response team are to include, but need not
be limited to: 1)         mobile outreach and face-to-face contact with the
adult in crisis, which face-to-face contact is to occur within 24 hours
following the initial referral or dispatch, except in situations requiring an
immediate response, in which case, face-to-face contact is to occur within one
hour after the initial referral or dispatch, unless a delay is requested by the
family of the adult in crisis, in order to meet the familys needs; 2)      the
immediate assessment and evaluation of the presenting crisis, including an
assessment of the safety of, or danger to, the adult in crisis, other residents
of the home, and members of the community, as well as an assessment of
caregiver culpability and clinical and environmental factors that contributed
to the crisis; 3)        the immediate use of clinical and therapeutic
interventions to stabilize the presenting crisis; 4)         the development of
an individualized crisis stabilization plan (ICSP), as provided by the bill,
which plan is to include, among other things, an indication of appropriate
clinical and therapeutic interventions to be used in addressing and stabilizing
the presenting crisis; and a plan to ensure the stabilization and treatment of
the adult in crisis in the least restrictive environment; and 5) the provision
of relevant information, crisis training, and program and service referrals to
the family members or caregivers of the adult in crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If, at any time during the
initial 72-hour mobile response period, the mobile crisis response team
determines that the presenting crisis can only be stabilized through the
temporary placement of the adult in a temporary stabilization unit, the crisis
response team will be required to transport the adult in crisis to a temporary
stabilization unit, and the adult will be admitted to the unit, for a period
not exceeding seven days, as necessary to facilitate the initial stabilization
of the crisis.  A temporary stabilization unit is to be approved and licensed
by the Department of Health, and is to:  1) provide a calming, non-clinical,
and non-punitive environment for the stabilization of adults in crisis; 2) be
staffed by properly credentialed mental health professionals who are capable
of, and have expertise in, calming and stabilizing crisis situations in adults
with disabilities; 3) have a sufficient number of crisis beds to meet the
behavioral health crisis needs of citizens in the region in which the unit is
situated; and 4) be situated separately and apart from any other clinical or
mental health care unit or facility.  If the temporary stabilization unit is a
part of a separately licensed health care facility or hospital, the temporary
stabilization unit is to be unconnected to, and located separately from, any
emergency department or other department or unit of medicine, and is to utilize
an entrance that is separate from the entrance that is used by patients of, and
visitors to, such other departments or units. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever an adult is placed in
a crisis bed in a temporary stabilization unit, the need for such placement is
to be reviewed and documented by the mobile crisis response team on a daily
basis during such placement, and the adult is to be immediately discharged from
such placement upon a determination by the team that continued placement is no
longer necessary.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a crisis is not
sufficiently stabilized during the initial 72-hour mobile response period, or
during a related stay at a temporary stabilization unit, the mobile crisis
response team will be required to provide the adult in crisis with ongoing
stabilization management services, in the adults home, following the
completion of the initial crisis response period.  Stabilization management
services may not be provided, unless the DHS grants prior approval authorizing
the provision of such services to the adult in crisis.  The DHS may authorize
the mobile crisis response team to provide stabilization management services
for a period of up to eight weeks, as deemed by the department to be
appropriate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Stabilization management
services may include: 1) necessary mental or behavioral health intervention
services to maintain the stabilization of the crisis and minimize or eliminate
the factors that contributed to the crisis, including, but not limited to,
psychiatric or psychological services, medication management services,
community-based mental health rehabilitation services, such as behavioral
assistance services and intensive in-community services, and any other formal
or informal community-based mental health or behavioral health rehabilitation
services; and 2) continued advocacy, networking, and support by the mobile
crisis response team, as may be necessary to provide linkages and referrals to
appropriate community-based services, and to assist the adult in crisis, and
the family members or caregivers thereof, in accessing other benefits or
assistance programs for which they may be eligible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     During the stabilization
management period, the mobile crisis response team will be required to review
the ICSP on a weekly basis, in order to ensure that the services included
therein are effectively addressing the presenting crisis and any factors that
contributed to the crisis.  Any necessary amendments to the ICSP are to be
registered with the division within 24 hours after each review is concluded.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each mobile crisis response
agency will be required, under the bill, to maintain an individual service
record for each adult who is served thereby.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each mobile crisis response
agency and temporary stabilization unit will be eligible for reimbursement, as
described in the bill, for the services provided thereby under the bills
provisions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person seeking to deliver
crisis response services or stabilization management services as a member of a
mobile crisis response team, or as a staff member at a temporary stabilization
unit, will be required to comply with the criminal history record background
check requirements established by P.L.1999, c.358 (C.30:6D-63 et seq.), which
are applicable to community agency employees, as a condition of the persons
employment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires all
direct care staff members providing services at group homes for individuals
with intellectual or developmental disabilities to successfully complete a
course of training on:  1) the de-escalation and stabilization of crisis
episodes in adults with disabilities; 2) behavioral analysis and management;
and 3) behavioral health crisis recognition and identification.  The training
would also be required to inform direct care staff members of the mobile crisis
response system established under the bill, and the procedures that may be used
to obtain assistance from a mobile crisis response team whenever a group home resident
is experiencing a behavioral health crisis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the commissioner
to, on or before July 16, 2022, designate a crisis hotline center or centers to
provide crisis intervention services and crisis care coordination to
individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis
hotline from anywhere within the State 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  A
designated hotline center is to have an active agreement with the administrator
of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) for participation within the
network.  To ensure cohesive and coordinated crisis care, a designated hotline
center is to utilize technology that is interoperable between and across crisis
and emergency response systems used throughout the State and with the
Administrator of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
designated hotline center is to have the authority to deploy crisis and
outgoing services, including mobile crisis teams, and coordinate access to crisis
receiving and stabilization services as appropriate and according to guidelines
and best practices established by the NSPL.  A designated hotline center is to
coordinate access to crisis receiving and stabilization services for
individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis
hotline through appropriate information sharing regarding availability of
services.  A designated hotline center is to be utilized by the mobile crisis
response system to refer an eligible adult for mobile crisis response services
and stabilization management services pursuant to the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is to have
primary oversight of suicide prevention and crisis service activities and
essential coordination with a designated 9-8-8 hotline center.  A designated
hotline center is to meet the requirements set forth by NSPL for serving high
risk and specialized populations as identified by the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, including training requirements and
policies for transferring such callers to an appropriate specialized center or
subnetworks within or outside the NSPL network and for providing linguistically
and culturally competent care.  A designated hotline center is to provide
follow-up services to individuals accessing the 9-8-8 suicide prevention and
behavioral health crisis hotline consistent with guidance and policies
established by the NSPL. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the
commissioner is to provide onsite response services for crisis calls utilizing
State or local mobile crisis teams.  A mobile crisis team is to include a
behavioral health team, licensed behavioral health professionals, and peers, or
a behavioral health team and peers embedded within an emergency medical
services entity.  A mobile crisis team is to collaborate on data and crisis
response protocols with local law enforcement agencies and include police as
co-responders in behavioral health teams, and licensed behavioral health
professionals and peers, only as needed to respond to high-risk situations that
are unmanageable without law enforcement.  A mobile crisis team is to be
designed in partnership with community members, including people with
experience utilizing crisis services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is to
establish and maintain a 9-8-8 trust fund for the purposes of creating and
maintaining a Statewide 9-8-8 suicide prevention and mental health crisis
system pursuant to the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020 and the
Federal Communication Commissions rules adopted July 16, 2020, and national
guidelines for crisis care.  The fund is to consist of: monies from a Statewide
9-8-8 fee assessed on users pursuant to the bills provisions; appropriations,
if any; grants and gifts intended for deposit in the fund; interest, premiums,
gains, or other earnings on the fund; and any other monies that are deposited
in or transferred to the fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, monies in the
fund: do not revert at the end of any fiscal year and remain available for the
purposes of the fund in subsequent fiscal years; are not subject to transfer to
any other fund or to transfer, assignment, or reassignment for any other use or
purpose outside of those specified in the bill; and are continuously dedicated
for the purposes of the fund. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
commissioner, consistent with the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act of
2020, is to establish a monthly Statewide 9-8-8 fee on each resident that is a
subscriber of commercial mobile services or IP-enabled voice services at a
fixed rate that provides for the creation, operation, and maintenance of a
Statewide 9-8-8 suicide prevention and behavioral health crisis system and the
continuum of services provided pursuant to federal guidelines for crisis
services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the 9-8-8 fee
is not to be applied to mobile service users who receive benefits under the
federal Lifeline program as defined in 47 CFR 54.401.</p>
