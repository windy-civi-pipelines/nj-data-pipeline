it administers which: (a) are unusable or in a serious state of disrepair; (b)
can be restored in an economically feasible and sound manner; and (c) can be
retained in a safe, decent, and sanitary manner, upon completion of
rehabilitation or restoration; and</p>

provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, in making
grants or loans under this section, the department shall not require that
tenants be certified as low- or moderate-income or that contractual guarantees
or deed restrictions be in place to ensure continued low- and moderate-income
occupancy as a condition of providing housing assistance from any program
administered by the department, when that assistance is provided for a project
of moderate rehabilitation if the project: (1) contains 30 or fewer rental
units; and (2) is located in a census tract in which the median household
income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the housing region in
which the census tract is located, as determined for a three person household
by the department in accordance with the latest federal decennial census.  A
list of eligible census tracts shall be maintained by the department and shall
be adjusted upon publication of median income figures by census tract after
each federal decennial census.</p>

(C.52:27D-287.3), to fund rental assistance grants under the program created
pursuant to P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.1 et al.).  Such rental assistance
grants shall be deemed necessary and authorized pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222
(C.52:27D-301 et al.), in order to meet the housing needs of certain low-income
households who may not be eligible to occupy other housing produced pursuant to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that
housing constructed prior to April 1, 1980 may be counted toward a municipal
affordable housing obligation.  Before the enactment of P.L.2024, c.2, language
existed in the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et
al.) that could be construed to restrict the ability of a municipality to
obtain credit toward an affordable housing obligation for housing constructed
prior to April 1, 1980.  This bill is intended to clarify that, under the
conditions provided in the bill, municipalities may obtain credit for this type
of housing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill permits
a municipality to obtain credit for low- and moderate-income housing units
constructed prior to April 1, 1980, as part of the municipalitys fair share
plan and housing element, toward the municipalitys:</p>

prior round obligation, provided that the municipality is able to demonstrate
that the housing unit has been reserved for occupancy as low- or
moderate-income housing for a period of 20 years or more in compliance with the
bill, and the municipality has not already obtained credit for the housing
unit;</p>

April 1, 1980, if the housing unit is rehabilitated in compliance with rules
and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs the
commissioner, in addition to other grants or loans awarded through the New
Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to annually allocate the amounts as may
be necessary to fund the repair and rehabilitation of housing units constructed
prior to April 1, 1980, for the purpose of obtaining credit toward an
affordable housing obligation, in accordance with the authorities provided by
this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also directs the
commissioner to <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>adopt rules and regulations as
necessary for the implementation of the bill.  The bill directs the rules and
regulations of the commissioner to permit a municipality to apply to the
affordable housing dispute resolution program to adjust a fair share plan and
housing element to accommodate the allocation of credit for low- and
moderate-income housing created in accordance with this bill, even if the fair
share plan and housing element have already been approved.</span></p>
