and (2) is located in a census tract in which the median household income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the housing region in which the census tract is located, as determined for a three person household by the department in accordance with the latest federal decennial census.  A list of eligible census tracts shall be maintained by the department and shall be adjusted upon publication of median income figures by census tract after each federal decennial census. g.    In addition to other grants or loans awarded pursuant to this section, and without regard to any limitations on such grants or loans for any other purposes herein imposed, the commissioner shall annually allocate such amounts as may be necessary in the commissioner's discretion, and in accordance with section 3 of P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.3), to fund rental assistance grants under the program created pursuant to P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.1 et al.).  Such rental assistance grants shall be deemed necessary and authorized pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in order to meet the housing needs of certain low-income households who may not be eligible to occupy other housing produced pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). h.    The department and the State Treasurer shall submit the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" for an audit annually by the State Auditor or State Comptroller, at the discretion of the Treasurer.  In addition, the department shall prepare an annual report for each fiscal year, and submit it by November 30th of each year to the Governor and the Legislature, and the Joint Committee on Housing Affordability, or its successor, and post the information to its Internet website, of all activity of the fund, including details of the grants and loans by number of units, number and income ranges of recipients of grants or loans, location of the housing renovated or constructed using monies from the fund, the number of units upon which affordability controls were placed, and the length of those controls.  The report also shall include details pertaining to those monies allocated from the fund for use by the State rental assistance program pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.3) and subsection g. of this section. i.     The commissioner may award or grant the amount of any appropriation deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" pursuant to section 41 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-320.1) to municipalities pursuant to the provisions of section 39 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.40:55D-8.8). j.  In addition to other grants or loans awarded pursuant to this section, the commissioner shall annually allocate such amounts as may be necessary in the commissioners discretion to fund the repair and rehabilitation of housing units constructed prior to April 1, 1980, for the purpose of obtaining credit toward an affordable housing obligation, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2024, c.2, s.26) 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides that housing constructed prior to April 1, 1980 may be counted toward a municipal affordable housing obligation.  Before the enactment of P.L.2024, c.2, language existed in the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.) that could be construed to restrict the ability of a municipality to obtain credit toward an affordable housing obligation for housing constructed prior to April 1, 1980.  This bill is intended to clarify that, under the conditions provided in the bill, municipalities may obtain credit for this type of housing. Specifically, the bill permits a municipality to obtain credit for low- and moderate-income housing units constructed prior to April 1, 1980, as part of the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element, toward the municipalitys: (1)     unfulfilled prior round obligation, provided that the municipality is able to demonstrate that the housing unit has been reserved for occupancy as low- or moderate-income housing for a period of 20 years or more in compliance with the bill, and the municipality has not already obtained credit for the housing unit; (2)     prospective obligation, if the housing unit is reserved for occupancy as low- or moderate-income housing, in accordance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls; or (3)     present need obligation for a low- or moderate-income housing unit constructed prior to April 1, 1980, if the housing unit is rehabilitated in compliance with rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner). The bill also directs the commissioner, in addition to other grants or loans awarded through the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to annually allocate the amounts as may be necessary to fund the repair and rehabilitation of housing units constructed prior to April 1, 1980, for the purpose of obtaining credit toward an affordable housing obligation, in accordance with the authorities provided by this bill. The bill also directs the commissioner to adopt rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation of the bill.  The bill directs the rules and regulations of the commissioner to permit a municipality to apply to the affordable housing dispute resolution program to adjust a fair share plan and housing element to accommodate the allocation of credit for low- and moderate-income housing created in accordance with this bill, even if the fair share plan and housing element have already been approved. The bill would take effect immediately.

Specifically, the bill permits a municipality to obtain credit for low- and moderate-income housing units constructed prior to April 1, 1980, as part of the municipalitys fair share plan and housing element, toward the municipalitys: (1)     unfulfilled prior round obligation, provided that the municipality is able to demonstrate that the housing unit has been reserved for occupancy as low- or moderate-income housing for a period of 20 years or more in compliance with the bill, and the municipality has not already obtained credit for the housing unit; (2)     prospective obligation, if the housing unit is reserved for occupancy as low- or moderate-income housing, in accordance with the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls; or (3)     present need obligation for a low- or moderate-income housing unit constructed prior to April 1, 1980, if the housing unit is rehabilitated in compliance with rules and regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner). The bill also directs the commissioner, in addition to other grants or loans awarded through the New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund, to annually allocate the amounts as may be necessary to fund the repair and rehabilitation of housing units constructed prior to April 1, 1980, for the purpose of obtaining credit toward an affordable housing obligation, in accordance with the authorities provided by this bill. The bill also directs the commissioner to adopt rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation of the bill.  The bill directs the rules and regulations of the commissioner to permit a municipality to apply to the affordable housing dispute resolution program to adjust a fair share plan and housing element to accommodate the allocation of credit for low- and moderate-income housing created in accordance with this bill, even if the fair share plan and housing element have already been approved. The bill would take effect immediately.
