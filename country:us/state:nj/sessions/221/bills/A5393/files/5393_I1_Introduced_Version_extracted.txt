STATEMENT This bill reduces the out-of-pocket contribution for any covered person prescribed an asthma inhaler across State-regulated health insurance providers.  Current law limits copayments or coinsurance for a 30-day supply of prescription asthma inhalers to $50.  Under the bill, copayments or coinsurance for a 30-day supply of prescription asthma inhalers are reduced to $35. This coverage standard applies to individual or group hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, and health service corporations as well as individual and group health insurance policies and health maintenance organizations.  Additionally, the bill extends this coverage standard to individual and small employer health benefits plans and requires that the State Health Benefits Commission and the School Employees Health Benefits Commission ensure that their contracts comply with this coverage standard.

STATEMENT This bill reduces the out-of-pocket contribution for any covered person prescribed an asthma inhaler across State-regulated health insurance providers.  Current law limits copayments or coinsurance for a 30-day supply of prescription asthma inhalers to $50.  Under the bill, copayments or coinsurance for a 30-day supply of prescription asthma inhalers are reduced to $35. This coverage standard applies to individual or group hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, and health service corporations as well as individual and group health insurance policies and health maintenance organizations.  Additionally, the bill extends this coverage standard to individual and small employer health benefits plans and requires that the State Health Benefits Commission and the School Employees Health Benefits Commission ensure that their contracts comply with this coverage standard.
