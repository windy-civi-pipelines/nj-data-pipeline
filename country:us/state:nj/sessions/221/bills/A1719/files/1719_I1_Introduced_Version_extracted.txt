An Act concerning workers' compensation and temporary disability benefits, and amending R.S.34:15-36 and P.L.1948, c.110. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    R.S.34:15-36 is amended to read as follows: 34:15-36.  "Willful negligence" within the intent of this chapter shall consist of (1) deliberate act or deliberate failure to act, or (2) such conduct as evidences reckless indifference to safety, or (3) intoxication, operating as the proximate cause of injury, or (4) unlawful use of a controlled dangerous substance as defined in the "New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act," P.L.1970, c.226 (C.24:21-1 et seq.). "Employer" is declared to be synonymous with master, and includes natural persons, partnerships, and corporations; "employee" is synonymous with servant, and includes all natural persons, including officers of corporations, who perform service for an employer for financial consideration, exclusive of (1) employees eligible under the federal "Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act," 44 Stat. 1424 (33 U.S.C. s.901 et seq.), for benefits payable with respect to accidental death or injury, or occupational disease or infection; [and] (2) employees who are aliens unless they were lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the employment was performed, were lawfully present for the purpose of performing the employment, or otherwise were permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the employment was performed (including aliens who were lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 203(a)(7) or section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. s.1153(a)(7) or 8 U.S.C. s.1128(d)(5), respectively); and (3) casual employments, which shall be defined, if in connection with the employer's business, as employment the occasion for which arises by chance or is purely accidental; or if not in connection with any business of the employer, as employment not regular, periodic or recurring; provided, however, that forest fire wardens and forest firefighters employed by the State of New Jersey shall, in no event, be deemed casual employees. Employment shall be deemed to commence when an employee arrives at the employer's place of employment to report for work and shall terminate when the employee leaves the employer's place of employment, excluding areas not under the control of the employer; provided, however, when the employee is required by the employer to be away from the employer's place of employment, the employee shall be deemed to be in the course of employment when the employee is engaged in the direct performance of duties assigned or directed by the employer; but the employment of employee paid travel time by an employer for time spent traveling to and from a job site or of any employee who utilizes an employer authorized vehicle shall commence and terminate with the time spent traveling to and from a job site or the authorized operation of a vehicle on business authorized by the employer. Travel by a policeman, fireman, or a member of a first aid or rescue squad, in responding to and returning from an emergency, shall be deemed to be in the course of employment. Employment shall also be deemed to commence when an employee is traveling in a ridesharing arrangement between his or her place of residence or terminal near such place and his or her place of employment, if one of the following conditions is satisfied:  the vehicle used in the ridesharing arrangement is owned, leased or contracted for by the employer, or the employee is required by the employer to travel in a ridesharing arrangement as a condition of employment.

"Disability permanent in quality and total in character" means a physical or neuropsychiatric total permanent impairment caused by a compensable accident or compensable occupational disease, where no fundamental or marked improvement in such condition can be reasonably expected. Factors other than physical and neuropsychiatric impairments may be considered in the determination of permanent total disability, where such physical and neuropsychiatric impairments constitute at least 75% or higher of total disability. "Ridesharing" means the transportation of persons in a motor vehicle, with a maximum carrying capacity of not more than 15 passengers, including the driver, where such transportation is incidental to the purpose of the driver.  This term shall include such ridesharing arrangements known as carpools and vanpools.

(f)   for any period of disability due to willfully and intentionally self-inflicted injury, or to injury sustained in the perpetration by the claimant of a crime of the first, second, or third degree; (g)  for any period during which the claimant performs any work for remuneration or profit; (h)  in a weekly amount which together with any remuneration the claimant continues to receive from the employer would exceed regular weekly wages immediately prior to disability; (i)   for any period during which a covered individual would be disqualified for unemployment compensation benefits under subsection (d) of R.S.43:21-5, unless the disability commenced prior to such disqualification; and there shall be no other cause of disqualification or ineligibility to receive disability benefits hereunder except as may be specifically provided in this act; (j)   for any period during which the claimant would be ineligible for unemployment compensation benefits under subsection (i) of R.S.43:21-4. (cf: P.L.1989, c.213, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill excludes illegal aliens from workers' compensation coverage unless they were lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time the employment was performed, were lawfully present for the purpose of performing the employment, or otherwise were permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time the employment was performed (including aliens who were lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 203(a)(7) or section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. s.1153(a)(7) or 8 U.S.C. s.1128(d)(5), respectively). The bill also provides that illegal aliens shall not be eligible to receive benefits pursuant to the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25) if they are not eligible for benefits pursuant to the "unemployment compensation law," R.S.43:21-1 et seq.  This bill is in response to the decision of Mateo Coria v. Board of Review and National Fence Systems, No. A-5076-89-T5 (App. Div. 1991).  In that case, the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court held that the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law" does not disqualify individuals for benefits based upon their status as illegal aliens.
