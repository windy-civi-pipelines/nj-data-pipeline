STATEMENT This bill requires the appointment of student-athlete mental health specialists at public school districts and public institutions of higher education. Under the bill, a school district that is a voluntary member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) is required to appoint a student-athlete mental health specialist. A school district may appoint a school guidance counselor, school psychologist, or another individual similarly trained that is already employed by the district if the individual is a State-licensed or State-certified mental health professional. A school district also has an option under the bill to hire a State-licensed or State-certified mental health professional to fill this position. A person appointed to the student-athlete mental health specialist position is required to obtain certification in Mental Health First Aid and complete the Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist Certification every two years. The bill requires the Department of Education to develop the certification program. Similarly, a public institution of higher education is required to appoint two student-athlete mental health specialists with individuals that are State-certified or State-licensed mental health professionals. A student-athlete mental health specialist at a public institution of higher education is also required to obtain certification in Mental Health First Aid and complete the Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist Certification from the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education every two years. The secretary is required to develop the certification program. Under the bill, the student-athlete mental health specialist is required to screen each student-athlete, provide mental health support to student-athletes, and monitor the impact of sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental health.  At public institutions of higher education, the two student-athlete mental health specialists are also required to be easily accessible to student-athletes during the academic year and have on-campus offices. A student-athlete in high school or attending a public institution of higher education has the option to waive the screening requirement by submitting a written statement to the student-athlete mental health specialist. However, if the student-athlete refuses the screening but does not submit a written statement, the student-athlete will be prohibited from participating in the organized sport. Additionally, a student-athlete mental health specialist, at both the high school and college levels, is responsible for the creation of a student-athlete mental health policy that: 1) recognizes the symptoms of mental health disorders that may affect student-athletes; 2) establishes mental health screening tools; 3) provides guidance on techniques for reducing stressors; 4) establishes protocols for non-emergent mental health referrals and emergent mental health situations; 5) creates a plan for transition care for students-athletes that leave the program; and 6) lists additional mental health resources and organizations that a student-athlete can consult for additional services. Under the bill, the department is required to establish a central registry of the aggregated screening data collected by a student-athlete mental health specialist for student-athletes in each school district. The secretary is required to create and maintain a similar registry from the aggregate data collected for student-athletes at public institutions of higher education. The purpose of these registries are to determine the stressors, rates, patterns, and trends of mental health disorders in student-athletes in order to develop evidence-based detection, prevention, and intervention protocols.  The bill stipulates that, in establishing both registries, the department and secretary are required to ensure that any student identifying information remains confidential. Under the bill, student-athlete mental health specialists are not subject to liability for exercising their judgment or discretion in connection with the performance of their duties or for any good faith act or omission related to the requirements set forth in the bill. Finally, the bill makes an appropriation from the General Fund to the department for the costs of implementing the provisions affecting high school student-athletes and to the secretary for the costs associated with implementing the provisions affecting college-aged student-athletes. The student-athlete mental health specialist position is created at the high school and college levels to improve student-athlete mental wellness. It is the intent of this bill to address mental health issues that affect high school and college student-athletes. Studies have indicated that student-athletes are less likely than their non-athlete peers to seek counseling and other professional help services. This bill seeks to remove the stigma of seeking mental health services by requiring the student-athlete mental health specialist to routinely meet with  student-athletes, provide mental health support to student-athletes, and monitor the impact of sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental health.

STATEMENT This bill requires the appointment of student-athlete mental health specialists at public school districts and public institutions of higher education. Under the bill, a school district that is a voluntary member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA) is required to appoint a student-athlete mental health specialist. A school district may appoint a school guidance counselor, school psychologist, or another individual similarly trained that is already employed by the district if the individual is a State-licensed or State-certified mental health professional. A school district also has an option under the bill to hire a State-licensed or State-certified mental health professional to fill this position. A person appointed to the student-athlete mental health specialist position is required to obtain certification in Mental Health First Aid and complete the Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist Certification every two years. The bill requires the Department of Education to develop the certification program. Similarly, a public institution of higher education is required to appoint two student-athlete mental health specialists with individuals that are State-certified or State-licensed mental health professionals. A student-athlete mental health specialist at a public institution of higher education is also required to obtain certification in Mental Health First Aid and complete the Student-Athlete Mental Health Specialist Certification from the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education every two years. The secretary is required to develop the certification program. Under the bill, the student-athlete mental health specialist is required to screen each student-athlete, provide mental health support to student-athletes, and monitor the impact of sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental health.  At public institutions of higher education, the two student-athlete mental health specialists are also required to be easily accessible to student-athletes during the academic year and have on-campus offices. A student-athlete in high school or attending a public institution of higher education has the option to waive the screening requirement by submitting a written statement to the student-athlete mental health specialist. However, if the student-athlete refuses the screening but does not submit a written statement, the student-athlete will be prohibited from participating in the organized sport. Additionally, a student-athlete mental health specialist, at both the high school and college levels, is responsible for the creation of a student-athlete mental health policy that: 1) recognizes the symptoms of mental health disorders that may affect student-athletes; 2) establishes mental health screening tools; 3) provides guidance on techniques for reducing stressors; 4) establishes protocols for non-emergent mental health referrals and emergent mental health situations; 5) creates a plan for transition care for students-athletes that leave the program; and 6) lists additional mental health resources and organizations that a student-athlete can consult for additional services. Under the bill, the department is required to establish a central registry of the aggregated screening data collected by a student-athlete mental health specialist for student-athletes in each school district. The secretary is required to create and maintain a similar registry from the aggregate data collected for student-athletes at public institutions of higher education. The purpose of these registries are to determine the stressors, rates, patterns, and trends of mental health disorders in student-athletes in order to develop evidence-based detection, prevention, and intervention protocols.  The bill stipulates that, in establishing both registries, the department and secretary are required to ensure that any student identifying information remains confidential. Under the bill, student-athlete mental health specialists are not subject to liability for exercising their judgment or discretion in connection with the performance of their duties or for any good faith act or omission related to the requirements set forth in the bill. Finally, the bill makes an appropriation from the General Fund to the department for the costs of implementing the provisions affecting high school student-athletes and to the secretary for the costs associated with implementing the provisions affecting college-aged student-athletes. The student-athlete mental health specialist position is created at the high school and college levels to improve student-athlete mental wellness. It is the intent of this bill to address mental health issues that affect high school and college student-athletes. Studies have indicated that student-athletes are less likely than their non-athlete peers to seek counseling and other professional help services. This bill seeks to remove the stigma of seeking mental health services by requiring the student-athlete mental health specialist to routinely meet with  student-athletes, provide mental health support to student-athletes, and monitor the impact of sports-related injuries on student-athletes mental health.
