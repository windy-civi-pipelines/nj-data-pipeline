The safeguards contained in the program shall be consistent with the safeguards for protection of personal information and information of a similar character set forth in any State or federal regulations by which the person who owns or licenses the information may be regulated. b.    Every comprehensive information security program shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1)   designating one or more employees to maintain the comprehensive information security program; (2)   identifying and assessing reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any electronic, paper or other records containing personal information, and evaluating and improving, where necessary, the effectiveness of the current safeguards for limiting the risks, including but not limited to: (a)   ongoing employee training, including ongoing training for temporary and contract employees; (b)   employee compliance with policies and procedures; and (c)   means for detecting and preventing security system failures; (3)   developing security policies for employees relating to the storage, access and transportation of records containing personal information outside of business premises;

(6)   oversight of service providers by: (a)   taking reasonable steps to select and retain third-party service providers that are capable of maintaining appropriate security measures to protect personal information consistent with this act and any applicable federal regulations; and (b)   requiring third-party service providers by contract to implement and maintain appropriate security measures for personal information; (7)   reasonable restrictions upon physical access to records containing personal information, and storage of records and data in locked facilities, storage areas or containers; (8)   regular monitoring to ensure that the comprehensive information security program is operating in a manner reasonably calculated to prevent unauthorized access to or unauthorized use of personal information, and upgrading information safeguards as necessary to limit risks; (9)   reviewing the scope of the security measures at least annually or whenever there is a material change in business practices that may reasonably implicate the security or integrity of records containing personal information; and (10)  documenting responsive actions taken in connection with any incident involving a breach of security, and mandatory post-incident review of events and actions taken, if any, to make changes in business practices relating to protection of personal information. 3.    Every person that owns or licenses personal information about a resident of this State and electronically stores or transmits the information shall include in its comprehensive information security program the establishment and maintenance of a security system covering its computers, including any wireless system, that, at a minimum, and to the extent technically feasible, shall have the following elements: a.     secure user authentication protocols including: (1)   control of user IDs and other identifiers; (2)   a reasonably secure method of assigning and selecting passwords, or use of unique identifier technologies, such as biometrics or token devices; (3)   control of data security passwords to ensure that passwords are kept in a location or format that does not compromise the security of the data they protect; (4)   restricting access to active users and active user accounts only; and (5)   blocking access to user identification after multiple unsuccessful attempts to gain access or the limitation placed on access for the particular system; b.    secure access control measures that: (1)   restrict access to records and files containing personal information to those who need that information to perform their job duties; and (2)   assign unique identifications and passwords, which are not vendor supplied default passwords, to each person with computer access, that are reasonably designed to maintain the integrity of the security of the access controls; c.     encryption of all transmitted records and files containing personal information that will travel across public networks, and encryption of all data containing personal information to be transmitted wirelessly; d.    reasonable monitoring of systems for unauthorized use of or access to personal information; e.     encryption of all personal information stored on laptops or other portable devices; f.     with respect to files containing personal information on a system that is connected to the Internet, reasonably up-to-date firewall protection and operating system security patches, which are reasonably designed to maintain the integrity of the personal information; g.    reasonably up-to-date versions of system security agent software which shall include malware protection and reasonably up-to-date patches and virus definitions, or a version of that software that can still be supported with up-to-date patches and virus definitions, and is set to receive the most current security updates on a regular basis; and h.    education and training of employees on the proper use of the computer security system and the importance of personal information security. 4.    It shall be an unlawful practice and a violation of P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.) to willfully, knowingly or recklessly violate the provisions of this act. 5.    This act shall take effect on the 120th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill requires any person, corporation, association, partnership or other legal entity that owns or licenses personal information about a resident of this State to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive information security program that is written in one or more readily accessible parts and contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are necessary to protect the personal information. The bill provides that it would be an unlawful practice under the consumer fraud act, P.L.1960, c.39 (C.56:8-1 et seq.), to willfully, knowingly or recklessly violate the provisions of the bill.  An unlawful practice is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense.  Additionally, a violation can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of treble damages and costs to those injured as a result of the violation.
