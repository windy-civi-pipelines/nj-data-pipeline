P.L.1971, c.356 (C.56:10-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Section 1 of P.L.1989,
c.24 (C.56:10-7.2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature hereby
finds and declares the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Notwithstanding the
enactment of the &quot;Franchise Practices Act,&quot; P.L.1971, c.356 (C.
56:10-1 et seq.), and other legislation dealing with the franchisor-franchisee
relationship, including, but not limited to P.L.1982, c.156 (C. 56:10-17 et
seq.), inequality of bargaining power continues to exist between motor vehicle
franchisors and motor vehicle franchisees. This inequality of bargaining power
exists even as to motor vehicle franchisees who have had their franchises for
many years and who have expended large sums of money in the promotion of their
franchises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    This inequality of
bargaining power enables motor vehicle franchisors to compel motor vehicle
franchisees to execute franchises and related leases and agreements which
contain terms and conditions that would not routinely be agreed to by the motor
vehicle franchisees absent the compulsion and duress which arise out of the
inequality of bargaining power. These terms and conditions are detrimental to
the interests of the motor vehicle franchisees in that they require the motor
vehicle franchisees to relinquish their rights which have been established by
the &quot;Franchise Practices Act&quot; and supplemental legislation and other
statutes and laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As a result, motor
vehicle franchisees have been denied the opportunity to have disputes with
their motor vehicle franchisors arising out of the franchisor-franchisee
relationship heard in an appropriate venue, convenient to both parties, by
tribunals established by statute for the resolution of these disputes.  It is
therefore necessary and in the public interest to ensure that motor vehicle
franchisees voluntarily determine whether to agree to certain terms and
conditions contained in franchises and related leases and agreements presented
to them by motor vehicle franchisors and under circumstances unaffected by the
compulsion which arises from the inequality of bargaining power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>d.    The distribution,
sale, and service of new motor vehicles in the State of New Jersey vitally
affects the general economy of this State, and there is a compelling public
interest in providing a system of new motor vehicle franchisees to foster
competition and promote motor vehicle and highway safety by ensuring there are
qualified facilities to provide independently owned and operated sales,
warranty, open recall, and routine service for motor vehicles.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>e.     The new motor
vehicle franchise system encourages local investment in motor vehicle
dealerships, creates jobs and economic activity in virtually every community in
this State, and advances the public interest by fostering an extensive network
of independent new motor vehicle franchisees who compete for motor vehicle
sales and service business, offer ready access to open recall and warranty
service, when needed, and provide routine maintenance to ensure motor vehicle
and highway safety.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>f.     There remains,
however, a vast disparity in bargaining power between motor vehicle franchisors
and their franchisees, which, if left unchecked, would discourage local
investment in the motor vehicle franchise system and result in fewer new motor
vehicle franchisees, less competition in the motor vehicle marketplace, and
diminished consumer access to qualified motor vehicle warranty, open recall,
and routine service facilities.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>g.    Despite prior
enactments, certain motor vehicle franchisors have failed to comply with the
law, and many motor vehicle franchisees have found it either too risky to
oppose their supplier or too burdensome to take on a legal challenge to unfair
or oppressive marketplace behavior carried out by motor vehicle franchisors,
which franchisors control the exclusive supply of motor vehicles, parts, and
special equipment to motor vehicle franchisees.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>h.    As a result, it is
necessary for the Legislature to further revise the laws pertaining to motor
vehicle franchisees to strengthen and clarify certain provisions of existing
law intended to protect the public from marketplace behavior that has the
potential to restrict competition for sales and threaten highway safety by
limiting consumer access to essential warranty and open recall service provided
by neighborhood new car dealers.</u></p>

any of the following practices:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    To utilize an arbitrary
or unreasonable formula or other calculation or process intended to gauge
performance as a basis for making any decision or taking any action governed by
P.L.1971, c.356 (C.56:10-1 et seq.).</p>

which is authorized to perform warranty service on motor vehicles manufactured
or distributed by the motor vehicle franchisor.  The establishment, relocation,
reopening or reactivation of such a facility pursuant to an agreement with a

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     To require an
unconditional release from a motor vehicle franchisee without permitting the

allowance, credit or bonus, and on reasonable, good faith and
non-discriminatory allocation and availability terms.  However, the failure to
deliver any such motor vehicle shall not be considered a violation of this
section if the failure is not arbitrary and is due to a lack of manufacturing
capacity or to a strike or labor difficulty, a shortage of materials, a freight
embargo or other cause over which the franchisor has no control.  A motor
vehicle franchisor shall not require a motor vehicle franchisee to purchase
unreasonable quantities of advertising materials, purchase special tools not

franchise is operated, to restrict the uses to which the facility at which the
motor vehicle franchise is operated may be put during or after the term of the
franchise, or to take or withhold or threaten to take or withhold any action,
impose or threaten to impose any penalty, or deny or threaten to deny any
benefit, as a result of the failure or refusal of a motor vehicle franchisee,
property owner, or landlord to agree to or comply with any such demand or
restriction.  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to bar a voluntary
agreement between a motor vehicle franchisor and a motor vehicle franchisee, or
the owner or landlord of property on which a motor vehicle franchise is
operated, to give the motor vehicle franchisor or the person under the control
of the motor vehicle franchisor an interest in or option with respect to the
real property on which a motor vehicle franchise is operated, or to restrict
the uses to which the facility at which the motor vehicle franchise is operated
is put, provided that separate and valuable consideration is paid for such
interest, option or restriction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     To require or attempt
to require a motor vehicle franchisee to relocate his franchise or to implement
any facility or operational modification or to take or withhold or threaten to

reasonable return on his total investment in such facility or from such
operational modification, and the full return of his total investment in such

modification is required so that the motor vehicle franchisee can effectively
sell and service a motor vehicle offered by the motor vehicle franchisor based
on the specific technology of the motor vehicle.  This subsection shall not be
construed as requiring a motor vehicle franchisor to guarantee that the return
as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection will be realized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration Recall Information</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a motor
vehicle franchisee or dealer to access information on open recalls available on
the Internet website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) prior to selling a used motor vehicle.  If a recall is discovered, a
franchisee or dealer is required to inform a prospective purchaser by providing
a printed copy of the recall information.  A franchisee or dealer is prohibited
from selling a used motor vehicle that is subject to a stop-sale notice,
do-not-drive notice, or similar notice or designation issued by the NHTSA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates an irrebuttable
presumption that a franchisee or dealer had no knowledge of the existence of an
open recall, stop-sale notice, do-not-drive notice, or similar notice or
designation on a used motor vehicle if, at the time of sale: (1) the franchisee
or dealer accessed the Internet website of the NHTSA; and (2) the franchisee or
dealers search using the specific vehicle identification number of the motor
vehicle yielded no indication of an open recall, stop-sale notice, do-not-drive
notice, or similar notice or designation.  The bill does not create a legal
duty or liability upon a franchisee or dealer related to the accuracy, errors,
or omissions of the Internet website.  The bill does not require a franchisee or
dealer to provide a prospective purchaser with recall information added to the
Internet website after providing the printed information on recalls at the time
of sale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any motor vehicle franchisor or
dealer offering motor vehicles for sale in this State is required to provide
the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission)
with a list of motor vehicles registered in this State that are subject to an
open recall for which the necessary repairs remain uncompleted for a period of
six months or longer after the initial notice of recall issued by the
manufacturer.  At a minimum, this list is to identify each motor vehicle by
year, make, model, and vehicle identification number.  A motor vehicle
franchisor or dealer is required to provide an updated list to the commission
every 180 days after submission of the initial list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 30 days of receiving
the lists, the commission is required to direct the motor vehicle franchisor or
dealer to send a notice on official commission letterhead, at the motor vehicle
franchisor or dealers expense, to all registered owners of the listed motor
vehicles.  The bill provides the form to be used for this notice, which is to
inform recipients of an open recall and the options available to resolve the
issue, including contact information for the NHTSA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Compensation for Recall Costs</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a motor
vehicle franchisor is required to compensate a motor vehicle franchisee for all
reasonable costs incurred by the franchisee in complying with the requirements
imposed by the franchisor relating to a product recall.  In addition to these
compensation requirements, the bill also provides guidance on certain costs that
must be remitted to a motor vehicle franchisee in the event of a recall.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that for
certain new motor vehicles, or used motor vehicles of the same line make as the
motor vehicle franchisor and motor vehicle franchisee, and subject to a
stop-sale notice, do-not-drive notice, or similar notice or designation for
which a part or remedy is not reasonably available, which motor vehicles are
held for sale by the motor vehicle franchisee, the costs of the motor vehicle
franchisee are to equal 1.75 percent of the value of each motor vehicle per
month, or per portion of a month.  This requirement applies when not preempted
by federal law or regulation.  For the purposes of this calculation, a motor
vehicles value is to be the motor vehicle franchisors suggested retail price,
or for a used motor vehicle, the value is to be the average trade-in value as
indicated in an independent third-party guide for the year, make, model, and
mileage.  Under the bill, a motor vehicle franchisor may compensate its motor
vehicle franchisees under a national recall compensation program if the
compensation thereby provided is at least the value provided for by this
requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits a motor
vehicle franchisor from reducing the amount of compensation otherwise owed to a
motor vehicle franchisee because the motor vehicle franchisee has submitted a
claim for reimbursement pursuant to the new guidance on compensation for
recalls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Reimbursement for Certain
Expenses</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, certain
requirements are triggered if a motor vehicle franchise requires or permits
motor vehicle franchisees to perform services or provide parts in satisfaction
of a warranty issued by the motor vehicle franchisor.  This bill amends this
requirement to extend to the satisfaction of a warranty, extended warranty,
maintenance, or other service-related plan offered by the motor vehicle
franchisor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, labor services
to be reimbursed include diagnostic work.  In the case of entire engine and
entire transmission assemblies, the bill provides that the motor vehicle
franchisor is required to reimburse the motor vehicle franchisee in the amount
of 30 percent of what the motor vehicle franchisee would have paid the motor
vehicle franchisor for a part if the part had not been supplied by the
franchisor other than by the sale of that part to the motor vehicle franchisee.
 The bill removes franchisor administered service and repair plans from
consideration of reimbursement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends certain
provisions of law concerning the process for calculating average percentage
parts markup.  Specifically, the bill provides that franchisor-administered
service or repair plans covering only routine maintenance service on plans sold
to customers after March 12, 1999 are relevant to this calculation. 
Additionally, the prohibition on a motor vehicle franchisor to require a
franchisee to establish average percentage parts markup and labor rate by an unduly
burdensome or time consuming methodology is amended to prohibit a demand for
part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that adequate
and fair compensation for labor services rendered in a repair requires the
motor vehicle franchisor to pay each motor vehicle franchisee no less than the
amount the retail customer pays for the same labor services with regard to rate
and time.  In calculating this amount, the bill permits the use of a time
guide, entered into by the franchisor and franchisee, in lieu of the actual
time expended on the repair.  In the event that a time guide has not been
agreed to for repairs or the time guide does not specify a time for the
applicable repair, the motor vehicle franchisors time guide is to be used,
except that the motor vehicle franchisors definition of time for an applicable
repair is multiplied by 1.5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
provides that a motor vehicle franchisor is to pay a motor vehicle franchisee
an hourly rate for labor services performed in connection with repairs.  The
hourly rate is to be the greater of: (1) an amount calculated by dividing the
amount of the franchisees total labor sales for retail customer repairs by the
number of total labor hours that generated such sales for the month preceding a
request for reimbursement; or (2) an amount equal to the franchisees markup
over cost that results in the same gross profit percentage for labor hours
performed for retail customer repairs.  For the second of these options, the franchisees
gross profit percentage comes from the franchisees financial statements
provided to the franchisor for the two months preceding the franchisees
written request, and the franchisee is required to provide in the written
request the arithmetic mean of the hourly wage paid to all its technicians
during the preceding two months preceding the request.  The arithmetic mean is
the franchisee cost used in the calculation of an hourly rate for labor
services performed in connection with repairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Restrictions on Reimbursement</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A motor vehicle franchisor is
prohibited under the bill from recovering its costs from a motor vehicle
franchisee, except in certain circumstances.  However, a motor vehicle
franchisors right to increase prices for vehicles or parts in the normal
course of business is preserved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A motor vehicle franchisor is
prohibited under the bill from charging back any claim paid for labor services
and parts provided in the performance of an open recall, warranty, or other
services agreement for an incentive, bonus, sales, performance, or other
program without providing written notice to the franchisee within 30 days from
the on-site audit, which written notice explains in detail the basis for each
of the proposed chargebacks and the methodology by which the franchisee was
selected for audit or review.  After all internal dispute resolution processes
provided through the franchisor have been resolved, the franchisor is required
to provide final notice to the franchisee of the final amount of the proposed
chargeback.  If the franchisee or its representative institutes an
administrative or judicial action for a violation of the act, challenging the
chargeback within 30 days of the receipt of the final notice, the total proposed
chargeback amounts are to be stayed, without bond, until the final judgment has
been rendered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A franchisor is not permitted
to deny or charge back a claim paid for labor services and parts provided in
the performance of an open recall, warranty, or other service agreement or for
an incentive, bonus, sales, performance, or other program unless the franchisor
satisfies its burden of proof that the franchisee did not make a good faith
effort to comply with the reasonable written procedures of the franchisor, that
the franchisee did not actually perform the work, or that the claim was
materially false or fraudulent.  A franchisor is not permitted to deny or
charge back a claim due to an administrative or scriveners error in the
submission of the claim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a motor
vehicle franchisor is not to unilaterally reduce or manipulate the price of
parts required for warranty or open recall services in a manner that unfairly
and unilaterally allows the franchisor to reduce the level of compensation paid
to motor vehicle franchisees for warranty and open recall services within 60 or
fewer days preceding an announcement of an open recall, any time after an open
recall, or after a warranty claim has arisen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Standing of Certain Corporations
or Associations</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that any
corporation or association which is primarily owned by or comprised of motor
vehicle franchises has standing to file an administrative petition, or to bring
an action before any court of competent jurisdiction, for itself or by, for, or
on behalf of any motor vehicle franchisee or group of motor vehicle franchisees
for any alleged violation of the act.</p>
