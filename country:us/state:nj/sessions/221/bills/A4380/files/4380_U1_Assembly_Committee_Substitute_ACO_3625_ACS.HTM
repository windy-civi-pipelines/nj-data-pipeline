repair or modification to a motor vehicle by an authorized motor vehicle

prescribed is for the manufacturer to repurchase the motor vehicle or otherwise
provide financial compensation to the owner of the motor vehicle.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Prior to issuing a motor
vehicle registration or registration renewal notice, the commission shall
review information made available by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration to determine whether a motor vehicle is subject to an open
recall.  For a vehicle that is subject to an open recall, the commission shall
provide the owner of the motor vehicle with written notice of each open recall
applicable to the motor vehicle.  The open recall notice shall be provided at
the time the motor vehicle is registered, except that for registration
renewals, the open recall notice shall be included in the registration renewal
notice.  The open recall notice shall include the following:  </p>

not exceed the actual costs incurred by the commission each year to implement the
provisions of this section.  The amount of the fee shall be determined by the
chief administrator each year based on documentation of the actual costs
incurred by the commission to implement the provisions of this section, which
documentation shall be published annually on the commissions Internet website

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Section 1 of P.L.1989,
c.24 (C.56:10-7.2) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature hereby
finds and declares the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Notwithstanding the
enactment of the &quot;Franchise Practices Act,&quot; P.L.1971, c.356 (C.56:10-1
et seq.), and other legislation dealing with the franchisor-franchisee
relationship, including, but not limited to P.L.1982, c.156 (C.56:10-17 et seq.),
inequality of bargaining power continues to exist between motor vehicle
franchisors and motor vehicle franchisees. This inequality of bargaining power
exists even as to motor vehicle franchisees who have had their franchises for
many years and who have expended large sums of money in the promotion of their
franchises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    This inequality of
bargaining power enables motor vehicle franchisors to compel motor vehicle
franchisees to execute franchises and related leases and agreements which
contain terms and conditions that would not routinely be agreed to by the motor
vehicle franchisees absent the compulsion and duress which arise out of the
inequality of bargaining power. These terms and conditions are detrimental to
the interests of the motor vehicle franchisees in that they require the motor
vehicle franchisees to relinquish their rights which have been established by
the &quot;Franchise Practices Act&quot; and supplemental legislation and other
statutes and laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As a result, motor
vehicle franchisees have been denied the opportunity to have disputes with
their motor vehicle franchisors arising out of the franchisor-franchisee
relationship heard in an appropriate venue, convenient to both parties, by
tribunals established by statute for the resolution of these disputes.  It is
therefore necessary and in the public interest to ensure that motor vehicle
franchisees voluntarily determine whether to agree to certain terms and
conditions contained in franchises and related leases and agreements presented
to them by motor vehicle franchisors and under circumstances unaffected by the
compulsion which arises from the inequality of bargaining power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>d.    The distribution,
sale, and service of new motor vehicles in the State of New Jersey vitally
affects the general economy of this State, and there is a compelling public
interest in providing a system of new motor vehicle franchisees to foster
competition and promote motor vehicle and highway safety by ensuring there are
qualified facilities to provide independently owned and operated sales,
warranty, open recall, and routine service for motor vehicles.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>e.     The new motor
vehicle franchise system encourages local investment in motor vehicle
dealerships, creates jobs and economic activity in virtually every community in
this State, and advances the public interest by fostering an extensive network
of independent new motor vehicle franchisees who compete for motor vehicle
sales and service business, offer ready access to open recall repair service and
warranty service, when needed, and provide routine maintenance to ensure motor
vehicle and highway safety.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>f.     There remains,
however, a vast disparity in bargaining power between motor vehicle franchisors
and their franchisees, which, if left unchecked, will discourage local
investment in the motor vehicle franchise system and result in fewer new motor
vehicle franchisees, less competition in the motor vehicle marketplace, and
diminished consumer access to qualified motor vehicle warranty services, open
recall repair services, and routine service facilities.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>g.    Despite prior
enactments, many motor vehicle franchisees have found it either too risky to
oppose their supplier or too burdensome to take on a legal challenge to their
motor vehicle franchisors, who control the exclusive supply of motor vehicles,
parts, and special equipment to motor vehicle franchisees.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>h.    As a result, it is
necessary for the Legislature to further revise the laws pertaining to motor
vehicle franchisees to strengthen and clarify certain provisions of existing
law intended to protect the public from marketplace behavior that has the
potential to restrict competition for sales and threaten highway safety by
limiting consumer access to essential warranty and open recall service provided
by neighborhood dealers of new motor vehicles.</u></p>

requirement that the motor vehicle franchisor accept the return of the motor
vehicle or make payment to a consumer with respect to the motor vehicle
pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1988, c.123 (C.56:12-29 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For the purposes of this

by the sum of 1.0 and the franchisee's average percentage <u>parts</u> markup
over the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts purchased by the
motor vehicle franchisee from the motor vehicle franchisor and sold at retail. 
The motor vehicle franchisee may establish average percentage <u>parts</u>
markup under this section by submitting to the motor vehicle franchisor 100
sequential customer paid service repair orders or 90 days of customer paid
