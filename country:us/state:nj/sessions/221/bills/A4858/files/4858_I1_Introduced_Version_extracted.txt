CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act establishing tax credits for advanced nuclear energy facilities and supplementing and amending various sections of statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section)   a. A taxpayer that is a manufacturer of equipment and components for advanced nuclear facilities licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount equal to 15 percent of the amount paid during the privilege period for: (1)  new manufacturing equipment installed at a new or existing manufacturing facility located within the State; and (2)  the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation, or erection of improvements or additions that result in the renovation, modernization, or expansion of a manufacturing facility located within the State. b.    If a taxpayer relocates its business operations to this State from another state within six months prior to the taxpayers initial application for the credit, the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this section shall increase to 25 percent of the amount paid for each of the first three privilege periods for which the taxpayer is eligible to receive the credit. A taxpayer that qualifies for an increased credit pursuant to this subsection shall not be eligible for an increased credit pursuant to subsection c. of this section. c.    If a taxpayer is certified by the State as a "minority business" or a "women's business" pursuant to P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.17 et seq.) or qualifies as a "veteran-owned business" pursuant to P.L.2011, c.147 (C.52:32-50 et seq.), the amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this section shall increase to 25 percent of the amount paid during the privilege period.  A taxpayer that qualifies for an increased credit pursuant to this subsection shall not be eligible for an increased credit pursuant to subsection b. of this section. d.    A credit shall not be allowed under P.L.1993, c.170 (C.54:10A-5.4 et seq.), P.L.1993, c.171 (C.54:10A-5.16 et al.), P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24), or P.L.2001, c.321 (C.54:10A-5.31 et seq.) for expenditures for which a credit is allowed pursuant to this section. e.    The order of the application of the credits allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law shall be based on the order in which completed applications are received by the Department of the Treasury.  The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). f.     An unused credit may be carried forward, if necessary, for use in the seven privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit is allowed. g.    As used in this section: "Manufacturing equipment" means machinery, apparatus, or equipment used in the production of equipment and components for advanced nuclear reactors licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission. "Manufacturing facility" means a business location, including, but not limited to, a factory, mill, or plant, at which more than 50 percent of the business personal property that is housed in the facility is manufacturing equipment. 2.  (New section)   a.  The New Jersey Advanced Nuclear Energy Development Program is hereby established as a program under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  The authority, in consultation with the Board of Public Utilities, shall administer the program to encourage the construction of advanced nuclear energy facilities in the State through the provision of incentive tax credit awards to developers for the construction of facilities and production of energy at those facilities upon completion.  The board may approve the award of tax credits to a developer upon application to the authority. b.    A developer shall be eligible to receive an incentive tax credit for a facility project only if the developer demonstrates to the authority at the time of the application that: (1)  without the incentive tax credit, the facility project is not economically feasible; (2)  a project financing gap exists, or the authority determines that the facility project will generate a below market rate of return; (3)  the facility project is located at a current or decommissioned commercial nuclear generating facility in the State with a license that is or was previously issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission; (4)  except for demolition and site remediation activities, the developer has not commenced any construction at the site of the facility project prior to submitting an application, unless the authority determines that the facility project would not be completed otherwise or, in the event the facility project is to be undertaken in phases, the requested incentive tax credit is limited to only phases for which construction has not yet commenced; (5) the facility project shall comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards; (6) the facility project shall comply with the authoritys affirmative action requirements, adopted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1979, c.303 (C.34:1B-5.4); (7) during the eligibility period, each worker employed to perform construction work or building services work at the facility project shall be paid not less than the prevailing wage rate for the workers craft or trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and P.L.2005, c.379 (C.34:11-56.58 et seq.); (8)  the developer intends to initiate the process for acquisition of a license for the construction of an advanced nuclear reactor with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of calendar year 2023 and be issued an operator license for the facility by 2030; and (9)  the developer has complied with all requirements for filing tax and information returns and for paying or remitting required State taxes and fees by submitting, as a part of the application, a tax clearance certificate, as described in section 1 of P.L.2007, c.101 (C.54:50-39). In addition to the requirements set forth in this subsection, for a facility project to qualify for an incentive tax credit the developer shall contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project cost. c.    (1)  For a facility project eligible pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the developer shall submit an application to the authority in a form an manner prescribed in regulations adopted by the authority pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). The authority shall accept applications for incentive tax credits during the grant periods established pursuant to subsection d. of this section. (2)  The authority shall not consider an application for the advanced nuclear facility unless the developer submits a letter evidencing support for the project from the governing body of the municipality in which the commercial project is located with the application. (3)  The authority shall review the project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  In determining whether a project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law, P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act, P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developers State or local tax liability. The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state. The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant. A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developers application for a tax credit that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary. The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed facility project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. (4)  For a facility project subject to the requirement of paragraph 3 of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State equaling an amount determined by the authority through regulation that exceeds the requested tax credit amount. The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this subsection are true and accurate at the time of submission. (5)  If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developers application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit award. (6)  If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. d.    (1)  For the facility project eligible pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the authority shall award the incentive tax credit based on the order in which complete, qualifying applications were received by the authority. (2)  Prior to allocating an incentive tax credit award to the facility project, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or a developer not in substantial good standing with each department has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the developer, and that the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the facility project: (1) is registered as required by The Public Works Contractor Registration Act, P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. Provided that the developer, and all contractors and subcontractors, are in compliance with this subsection, the authority shall allocate incentive tax credit to the facility project according to the facility projects score and until either the available incentive tax credits are exhausted. If insufficient funding exists to fully fund the facility project, the project may be offered partial funding. e.  (1)  Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to subsections c. and d. of this section, the authority shall enter into an incentive tax credit award agreement with the developer. The chief executive officer of the authority shall negotiate the terms and conditions of the incentive tax credit award agreement on behalf of the State.  For a phased project, the incentive tax credit award agreement shall set forth, for each phase of the project and for the total project, the capital investment requirements and the time periods in which each phase of the project shall be commenced and completed. The awarding of tax credits shall be conditioned on the developers compliance with the requirements of the agreement. (2)  An incentive tax credit award agreement shall also specify that the amount of the credit shall be $1 million for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility upon completion and the duration of the eligibility period, which shall not exceed 20 years.  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall provide an estimated date of completion and include a requirement for periodic progress reports, including the submittal of executed financing commitments and documents that evidence site control. If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive tax credit. If the authority rescinds an incentive tax credit in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive tax credit award, then the authority may assign the incentive tax credit to another applicant. The incentive tax credit award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developers projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. Upon completion of construction of the project, the incentive tax credit award agreement shall provide for the distribution of a portion of the incentive tax credit in $1 million increments for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility. (3)  To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis. If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit. At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developers rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval. If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment. The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period. Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developers rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval. If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds. If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund. (4)  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit in any year in which the developer is found by the authority to not be in substantial good standing with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury or has entered into a practical corrective action plan. The incentive tax credit award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. (5)  A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive tax credit agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of project completion that begins during the eligibility period indicated in the incentive tax credit agreement. The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. (6)  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. f.  (1)  A developer approved for an incentive tax credit pursuant to subsections b. and c. of this section and that enters an incentive tax credit award agreement pursuant to subsection e. of this section shall submit annually, commencing in the year in which the incentive tax credit is issued and for the remainder of the eligibility period, a report indicating whether the developer is aware of any condition, event, or act that would cause the developer not to be in compliance with the incentive tax credit award agreement or the provisions of this section and any additional reporting requirements contained in the incentive tax credit award agreement or tax credit certificate. The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. (2)  Upon receipt and review of each report submitted during the eligibility period, the authority shall provide to the developer and the director a certificate of compliance indicating the amount of tax credits that the developer may apply against the developers tax liability.  Upon receipt by the director of the certificate of compliance, the director shall allow the developer a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). A developer shall apply the credit awarded against the developers liability under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 for the privilege period during which the director allows the developer a tax credit pursuant to this subsection. A developer shall not carry forward an unused credit unless the developer was unable to use the credit because the developers facility project was directly impacted due to a natural disaster, state emergency, national emergency, or a situation that was out of the developers control that impacted the developers use of the credit that year, in which case the developer is permitted to carry forward an unused credit for up to two years upon submitting evidence of the developers facility project being directly impacted by such a circumstance and receiving approval from the authority. Credits granted to a partnership shall be passed through to the partners, members, or owners, respectively, pro-rata, or pursuant to an executed agreement among the partners, members, or owners documenting an alternate distribution method provided to the director accompanied by any additional information as the director may prescribe. The director shall prescribe the order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law against the tax imposed under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). g.    (1)  A developer may apply to the director and the chief executive officer of the authority for an incentive tax credit transfer certificate, covering one or more years, in lieu of the developer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the developer. The incentive tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part in an amount not less than $25,000, in the privilege period during which the developer receives the incentive tax credit transfer certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit against a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5. The certificate provided to the developer shall include a statement waiving the developers right to claim the amount of the credit that the developer has elected to sell or assign against the developers tax liability. (2)  The developer shall not sell or assign, including a collateral assignment, an incentive tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section for consideration received by the developer of less than 85 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted. (3)  A purchaser or assignee of an incentive tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to this section shall not make any subsequent transfers, assignments, or sales of the tax credit transfer certificate. (4)  The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each incentive tax credit transfer certificate approved by the authority and the director pursuant to this section: the name of the transferrer; the name of the transferee; the value of the tax credit transfer certificate; and the consideration received by the transferrer. h.  (1)  A developer who has entered into an incentive tax credit agreement pursuant to subsection e. of this section may, upon notice to and written consent of the authority and State Treasurer, pledge, assign, transfer, or sell any or all of its right, title, and interest in and to the incentive tax credit agreement and in the incentive tax credits under the incentive tax credit agreement, and the right to receive the incentive tax credits, along with the rights and remedies provided to the developer under the incentive tax credit agreement. Any assignment shall be an absolute assignment for all purposes, including the federal bankruptcy code. (2)  Any pledge of an incentive tax credit made by the developer shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made and filed in the records of the authority. The incentive tax credit pledged and thereafter received by the developer shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the developer irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. As a condition of any incentive tax credit, the recipient, assignee, pledgee or subsequent holder of the incentive tax credit shall immediately file notice of the same with the clerk of the county in which the project is located. (3)  The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale approved by the authority pursuant to this section: the name of the person or entity offering the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of a right, title, or interest in an incentive tax credit agreement; the name of the person or entity receiving the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of a right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement; the value of the right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement; and the consideration received by the person or entity offering the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of the right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement. i.     Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the chief executive officer of the authority may adopt, immediately, upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, regulations that the chief executive officer deems necessary to implement the provisions of this section which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of the filing. The chief executive officer shall thereafter amend, adopt, or readopt the regulations in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 3.    Section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.): Advanced nuclear energy credit means the financial credit provided by the board to the first advanced nuclear energy facility operating in the State, on an annual basis for the first 25 years of facility operations, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.

STATEMENT This bill establishes two tax credits and a financial grant related to the construction and operation of advanced nuclear energy facilities. The bill allows a taxpayer that is a manufacturer of equipment and components for advanced nuclear facilities licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to apply for a corporation business tax credit equal to 15 percent of the amount paid during the privilege period for: (1) new manufacturing equipment installed at a new or existing manufacturing facility located within the State; and (2) the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation, or erection of improvements or additions that result in the renovation, modernization, or expansion of a manufacturing facility located within the State. The bill also creates the New Jersey Advanced Nuclear Energy Development Program within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to encourage the construction of advanced nuclear energy facilities in the State through the provision of incentive tax credits to a developer for the construction and production of energy at the facility.  The program would be administered by the authority in consultation with the Board of Public Utilities.  In order to qualify for the incentive tax credit established pursuant to this bill, a developer would be required to demonstrate that: · there is a need for project financing; · the project is located at a current or decommissioned commercial nuclear generating facility in the State with a license that is or was previously issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission; · the developer intends to initiate the process for acquisition of a license for the construction of an advanced nuclear reactor with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of calendar year 2023 and be issued an operator license for the facility by 2030; · the project will comply with various environmental, affirmative action, and wage standards; and · the developer will commit at least 20 percent of the total project cost. In addition to assisting with financing construction of an advanced nuclear energy facility, an incentive tax credit provided under the program would provide $1 million for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility upon completion. Finally, this bill establishes a financial grant to facilitate the construction and operation of the first advanced nuclear energy facility in the State.  The bill provides that commencing on January 1 next following the bills enactment, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) will be required to provide a financial grant (known as an advanced nuclear energy grant) to the first advanced nuclear energy facility operating in the State.  The grant is to equal $50 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated by the advanced nuclear energy facility in the preceding calendar year.  The first advanced nuclear energy facility in the State would be entitled to receive such a grant in each of the first 25 years of the facilitys operations.

"Manufacturing facility" means a business location, including, but not limited to, a factory, mill, or plant, at which more than 50 percent of the business personal property that is housed in the facility is manufacturing equipment. 2.  (New section)   a.  The New Jersey Advanced Nuclear Energy Development Program is hereby established as a program under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  The authority, in consultation with the Board of Public Utilities, shall administer the program to encourage the construction of advanced nuclear energy facilities in the State through the provision of incentive tax credit awards to developers for the construction of facilities and production of energy at those facilities upon completion.  The board may approve the award of tax credits to a developer upon application to the authority. b.    A developer shall be eligible to receive an incentive tax credit for a facility project only if the developer demonstrates to the authority at the time of the application that: (1)  without the incentive tax credit, the facility project is not economically feasible; (2)  a project financing gap exists, or the authority determines that the facility project will generate a below market rate of return; (3)  the facility project is located at a current or decommissioned commercial nuclear generating facility in the State with a license that is or was previously issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission; (4)  except for demolition and site remediation activities, the developer has not commenced any construction at the site of the facility project prior to submitting an application, unless the authority determines that the facility project would not be completed otherwise or, in the event the facility project is to be undertaken in phases, the requested incentive tax credit is limited to only phases for which construction has not yet commenced; (5) the facility project shall comply with minimum environmental and sustainability standards; (6) the facility project shall comply with the authoritys affirmative action requirements, adopted pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1979, c.303 (C.34:1B-5.4); (7) during the eligibility period, each worker employed to perform construction work or building services work at the facility project shall be paid not less than the prevailing wage rate for the workers craft or trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development pursuant to P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) and P.L.2005, c.379 (C.34:11-56.58 et seq.); (8)  the developer intends to initiate the process for acquisition of a license for the construction of an advanced nuclear reactor with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of calendar year 2023 and be issued an operator license for the facility by 2030; and (9)  the developer has complied with all requirements for filing tax and information returns and for paying or remitting required State taxes and fees by submitting, as a part of the application, a tax clearance certificate, as described in section 1 of P.L.2007, c.101 (C.54:50-39). In addition to the requirements set forth in this subsection, for a facility project to qualify for an incentive tax credit the developer shall contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project cost. c.    (1)  For a facility project eligible pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the developer shall submit an application to the authority in a form an manner prescribed in regulations adopted by the authority pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). The authority shall accept applications for incentive tax credits during the grant periods established pursuant to subsection d. of this section. (2)  The authority shall not consider an application for the advanced nuclear facility unless the developer submits a letter evidencing support for the project from the governing body of the municipality in which the commercial project is located with the application. (3)  The authority shall review the project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  In determining whether a project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law, P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act, P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developers State or local tax liability. The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state. The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant. A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developers application for a tax credit that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary. The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed facility project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. (4)  For a facility project subject to the requirement of paragraph 3 of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State equaling an amount determined by the authority through regulation that exceeds the requested tax credit amount. The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this subsection are true and accurate at the time of submission. (5)  If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developers application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit award. (6)  If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. d.    (1)  For the facility project eligible pursuant to subsection b. of this section, the authority shall award the incentive tax credit based on the order in which complete, qualifying applications were received by the authority. (2)  Prior to allocating an incentive tax credit award to the facility project, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or a developer not in substantial good standing with each department has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the developer, and that the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the facility project: (1) is registered as required by The Public Works Contractor Registration Act, P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. Provided that the developer, and all contractors and subcontractors, are in compliance with this subsection, the authority shall allocate incentive tax credit to the facility project according to the facility projects score and until either the available incentive tax credits are exhausted. If insufficient funding exists to fully fund the facility project, the project may be offered partial funding. e.  (1)  Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to subsections c. and d. of this section, the authority shall enter into an incentive tax credit award agreement with the developer. The chief executive officer of the authority shall negotiate the terms and conditions of the incentive tax credit award agreement on behalf of the State.  For a phased project, the incentive tax credit award agreement shall set forth, for each phase of the project and for the total project, the capital investment requirements and the time periods in which each phase of the project shall be commenced and completed. The awarding of tax credits shall be conditioned on the developers compliance with the requirements of the agreement. (2)  An incentive tax credit award agreement shall also specify that the amount of the credit shall be $1 million for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility upon completion and the duration of the eligibility period, which shall not exceed 20 years.  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall provide an estimated date of completion and include a requirement for periodic progress reports, including the submittal of executed financing commitments and documents that evidence site control. If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive tax credit. If the authority rescinds an incentive tax credit in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive tax credit award, then the authority may assign the incentive tax credit to another applicant. The incentive tax credit award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developers projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. Upon completion of construction of the project, the incentive tax credit award agreement shall provide for the distribution of a portion of the incentive tax credit in $1 million increments for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility. (3)  To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis. If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit. At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developers rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval. If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment. The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period. Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developers rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval. If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds. If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund. (4)  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive tax credit in any year in which the developer is found by the authority to not be in substantial good standing with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury or has entered into a practical corrective action plan. The incentive tax credit award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. (5)  A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive tax credit agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of project completion that begins during the eligibility period indicated in the incentive tax credit agreement. The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. (6)  The incentive tax credit award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. f.  (1)  A developer approved for an incentive tax credit pursuant to subsections b. and c. of this section and that enters an incentive tax credit award agreement pursuant to subsection e. of this section shall submit annually, commencing in the year in which the incentive tax credit is issued and for the remainder of the eligibility period, a report indicating whether the developer is aware of any condition, event, or act that would cause the developer not to be in compliance with the incentive tax credit award agreement or the provisions of this section and any additional reporting requirements contained in the incentive tax credit award agreement or tax credit certificate. The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. (2)  Upon receipt and review of each report submitted during the eligibility period, the authority shall provide to the developer and the director a certificate of compliance indicating the amount of tax credits that the developer may apply against the developers tax liability.  Upon receipt by the director of the certificate of compliance, the director shall allow the developer a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). A developer shall apply the credit awarded against the developers liability under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 for the privilege period during which the director allows the developer a tax credit pursuant to this subsection. A developer shall not carry forward an unused credit unless the developer was unable to use the credit because the developers facility project was directly impacted due to a natural disaster, state emergency, national emergency, or a situation that was out of the developers control that impacted the developers use of the credit that year, in which case the developer is permitted to carry forward an unused credit for up to two years upon submitting evidence of the developers facility project being directly impacted by such a circumstance and receiving approval from the authority. Credits granted to a partnership shall be passed through to the partners, members, or owners, respectively, pro-rata, or pursuant to an executed agreement among the partners, members, or owners documenting an alternate distribution method provided to the director accompanied by any additional information as the director may prescribe. The director shall prescribe the order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law against the tax imposed under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). g.    (1)  A developer may apply to the director and the chief executive officer of the authority for an incentive tax credit transfer certificate, covering one or more years, in lieu of the developer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the developer. The incentive tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part in an amount not less than $25,000, in the privilege period during which the developer receives the incentive tax credit transfer certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit against a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5. The certificate provided to the developer shall include a statement waiving the developers right to claim the amount of the credit that the developer has elected to sell or assign against the developers tax liability. (2)  The developer shall not sell or assign, including a collateral assignment, an incentive tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section for consideration received by the developer of less than 85 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted. (3)  A purchaser or assignee of an incentive tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to this section shall not make any subsequent transfers, assignments, or sales of the tax credit transfer certificate. (4)  The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each incentive tax credit transfer certificate approved by the authority and the director pursuant to this section: the name of the transferrer; the name of the transferee; the value of the tax credit transfer certificate; and the consideration received by the transferrer. h.  (1)  A developer who has entered into an incentive tax credit agreement pursuant to subsection e. of this section may, upon notice to and written consent of the authority and State Treasurer, pledge, assign, transfer, or sell any or all of its right, title, and interest in and to the incentive tax credit agreement and in the incentive tax credits under the incentive tax credit agreement, and the right to receive the incentive tax credits, along with the rights and remedies provided to the developer under the incentive tax credit agreement. Any assignment shall be an absolute assignment for all purposes, including the federal bankruptcy code. (2)  Any pledge of an incentive tax credit made by the developer shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge is made and filed in the records of the authority. The incentive tax credit pledged and thereafter received by the developer shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be valid and binding against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the developer irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. As a condition of any incentive tax credit, the recipient, assignee, pledgee or subsequent holder of the incentive tax credit shall immediately file notice of the same with the clerk of the county in which the project is located. (3)  The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale approved by the authority pursuant to this section: the name of the person or entity offering the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of a right, title, or interest in an incentive tax credit agreement; the name of the person or entity receiving the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of a right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement; the value of the right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement; and the consideration received by the person or entity offering the pledge, assignment, transfer, or sale of the right, title, or interest in the incentive tax credit agreement. i.     Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the chief executive officer of the authority may adopt, immediately, upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, regulations that the chief executive officer deems necessary to implement the provisions of this section which regulations shall be effective for a period not to exceed 180 days from the date of the filing. The chief executive officer shall thereafter amend, adopt, or readopt the regulations in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 3.    Section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51) is amended to read as follows: 3.    As used in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.): Advanced nuclear energy credit means the financial credit provided by the board to the first advanced nuclear energy facility operating in the State, on an annual basis for the first 25 years of facility operations, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.

STATEMENT This bill establishes two tax credits and a financial grant related to the construction and operation of advanced nuclear energy facilities. The bill allows a taxpayer that is a manufacturer of equipment and components for advanced nuclear facilities licensed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission to apply for a corporation business tax credit equal to 15 percent of the amount paid during the privilege period for: (1) new manufacturing equipment installed at a new or existing manufacturing facility located within the State; and (2) the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, installation, or erection of improvements or additions that result in the renovation, modernization, or expansion of a manufacturing facility located within the State. The bill also creates the New Jersey Advanced Nuclear Energy Development Program within the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to encourage the construction of advanced nuclear energy facilities in the State through the provision of incentive tax credits to a developer for the construction and production of energy at the facility.  The program would be administered by the authority in consultation with the Board of Public Utilities.  In order to qualify for the incentive tax credit established pursuant to this bill, a developer would be required to demonstrate that: · there is a need for project financing; · the project is located at a current or decommissioned commercial nuclear generating facility in the State with a license that is or was previously issued by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission; · the developer intends to initiate the process for acquisition of a license for the construction of an advanced nuclear reactor with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the end of calendar year 2023 and be issued an operator license for the facility by 2030; · the project will comply with various environmental, affirmative action, and wage standards; and · the developer will commit at least 20 percent of the total project cost. In addition to assisting with financing construction of an advanced nuclear energy facility, an incentive tax credit provided under the program would provide $1 million for each megawatt of energy produced by the facility upon completion. Finally, this bill establishes a financial grant to facilitate the construction and operation of the first advanced nuclear energy facility in the State.  The bill provides that commencing on January 1 next following the bills enactment, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) will be required to provide a financial grant (known as an advanced nuclear energy grant) to the first advanced nuclear energy facility operating in the State.  The grant is to equal $50 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated by the advanced nuclear energy facility in the preceding calendar year.  The first advanced nuclear energy facility in the State would be entitled to receive such a grant in each of the first 25 years of the facilitys operations.
