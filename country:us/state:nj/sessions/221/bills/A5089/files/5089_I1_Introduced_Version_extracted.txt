(2)   Eligible claimants shall include individuals within any of the filing categories set forth in N.J.S.54A:2-1 and any individual or individuals not required to file a gross income tax return because their gross income was below the minimum taxable income threshold established in N.J.S.54A:2-4 and N.J.S.54A:8-3.1.  In the case of a married individual filing a separate New Jersey gross income tax return, if the spouse of the claimant maintains the same homestead as the claimant and also files a separate gross income tax return in this State the homestead rebate or credit claimed under this subsection shall be equal to one-half of the amount of the homestead rebate or credit allowable had the spouses filed a joint return and homestead rebate or credit application. (3)   An application for a homestead rebate or credit shall be allowed for a homestead the title to which is held by a partnership, to the extent of the applicant's interest as a partner therein, and by a guardian, trustee, committee, conservator or other fiduciary for any individual who would otherwise be eligible for a rebate or credit.  An application for a homestead rebate or credit shall not be allowed for a homestead, the title to which is held partially or entirely by a corporate entity of any type, except as otherwise specifically allowed for an application from a resident of a property owned by a continuing care retirement community, or a cooperative or mutual housing corporation. d.    If the homestead of a claimant is a residential property consisting of more than one unit, that claimant shall be allowed a homestead rebate or credit pursuant to this section only in relation to the proportionate share of the property taxes assessed and levied against the residential unit occupied by that claimant, as determined by the local tax assessor. e.     Nothing in this section shall preclude a co-owner, who is other than a husband or wife claiming a homestead rebate or credit on the same homestead, from receiving a homestead rebate or credit determined pursuant to this section if another co-owner claims a homestead rebate or credit pursuant to this section, provided however, that each claim for a homestead rebate or credit determined pursuant to  this section shall be separately subject to the provisions of subsections c. and d. of this section. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2004, c.40.) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2004, c.40.) h.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.62.) i.  No claimant shall be able to receive a homestead rebate or credit, or a property tax benefit under the ANCHOR Property Tax Relief Program, issued pursuant to this section or section 4 of P.L.1990, c.61 (C.54:4-8.60), if the claimant is not a resident of this State in the calendar year in which the property tax rebate, credit, or benefit is to be paid. (cf: P.L.2007, c.62, s.23) 2.  This act shall take effect on January 1 next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit a person from receiving a homestead rebate or credit, or a property tax benefit under the ANCHOR Property Tax Relief Program, during any calendar year in which the person is not a resident of the State. Currently, the property tax benefits authorized under the Homestead Property Tax Credit Act are issued through the ANCHOR Property Tax Relief Program.  Under this program, property tax rebates are issued to eligible claimants based on property taxes paid in a previous calendar year.  To receive an ANCHOR property tax rebate, a person is only required to be a State resident during the calendar year for which the rebate is issued, provided that the person also meets all other eligibility requirements. This bill requires the recipient of a ANCHOR property tax rebate to be a State resident during the calendar year in which the rebate is paid, as well as the calendar year for which the rebate is issued.  This requirement would apply to any homestead rebate or credit authorized under the Homestead Property Tax Credit Act, including benefits issued under the ANCHOR Property Tax Relief Program.
