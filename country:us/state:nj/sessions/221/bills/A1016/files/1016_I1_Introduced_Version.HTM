<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.2017,
c.117 (C.45:1-62) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Unless specifically
prohibited or limited by federal or State law, a health care provider who
establishes a proper provider-patient relationship with a patient may remotely
provide health care services to a patient through the use of telemedicine.  A
health care provider may also engage in telehealth as may be necessary to
support and facilitate the provision of health care services to patients. 
Nothing in P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-61 et al.) shall be construed to allow a
provider to require a patient to use telemedicine or telehealth in lieu of
receiving services from an in-network provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Any health care provider
who uses telemedicine or engages in telehealth while providing health care
services to a patient, shall:  (1) be validly licensed, certified, or registered,
pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes, to provide such services in the
State of New Jersey; (2) remain subject to regulation by the appropriate New
Jersey State licensing board or other New Jersey State professional regulatory
entity; (3) act in compliance with existing requirements regarding the
maintenance of liability insurance; and (4) remain subject to New Jersey
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) Telemedicine
services may be provided using interactive, real-time, two-way communication
technologies or, subject to the requirements of paragraph (2) of this
paragraph, asynchronous store-and-forward technology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth may use asynchronous store-and-forward
technology to provide services with or without the use of interactive,
real-time, two-way audio if, after accessing and reviewing the patient's
medical records, the provider determines that the provider is able to meet the
same standard of care as if the health care services were being provided in
person and informs the patient of this determination at the outset of the
telemedicine or telehealth encounter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) (a) At the time the
patient requests health care services to be provided using telemedicine or
telehealth, the patient shall be clearly advised that the telemedicine or
telehealth encounter may be with a health care provider who is not a physician,
and that the patient may specifically request that the telemedicine or
telehealth encounter be scheduled with a physician.  If the patient requests
that the telemedicine or telehealth encounter be with a physician, the
encounter shall be scheduled with a physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) The identity, professional
credentials, and contact information of a health care provider providing
telemedicine or telehealth services shall be made available to the patient at
the time the patient schedules services to be provided using telemedicine or
telehealth, if available, or upon confirmation of the scheduled telemedicine or
telehealth encounter, and shall be made available to the patient during and
after the provision of services.  The contact information shall enable the
patient to contact the health care provider, or a substitute health care
provider authorized to act on behalf of the provider who provided services, for
at least 72 hours following the provision of services.  If the health care
provider is not a physician, and the patient requests that the services be
provided by a physician, the health care provider shall assist the patient with
scheduling a telemedicine or telehealth encounter with a physician.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth shall review the medical history and any
medical records provided by the patient.  For an initial encounter with the
patient, the provider shall review the patient's medical history and medical
records prior to initiating contact with the patient, as required pursuant to
paragraph (3) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.2017, c.117 (C.45:1-63).  In
the case of a subsequent telemedicine or telehealth encounter conducted
pursuant to an ongoing provider-patient relationship, the provider may review
the information prior to initiating contact with the patient or
contemporaneously with the telemedicine or telehealth encounter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   <u>(a)</u><b><sup><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'> </span></sup></b>Following
the provision of services using telemedicine or telehealth, the patient's
medical information shall be entered into the patient's medical record, whether
the medical record is a physical record, an electronic health record, or both,
and, if so requested to by the patient, forwarded directly to the patient's
primary care provider, health care provider of record or any other health care
providers as may be specified by the patient.  For patients without a primary
care provider or other health care provider of record, the health care provider
engaging in telemedicine or telehealth may advise the patient to contact a
primary care provider, and, upon request by the patient, shall assist the
patient with locating a primary care provider or other in-person medical
assistance that, to the extent possible, is located within reasonable proximity
to the patient.  The health care provider engaging in telemedicine or
telehealth shall also refer the patient to appropriate follow up care<u>,
emergency care, or complementary care</u> where necessary <b><span

evaluation in lieu of a psychiatric evaluation performed using telemedicine or
telehealth, the mental health screener, screening service, or screening
psychiatrist may nevertheless perform a psychiatric evaluation using
telemedicine and telehealth if it is determined that the patient cannot be scheduled
for an in-person psychiatric evaluation within the next 24 hours.  Nothing in
this paragraph shall be construed to prevent a patient who receives a
psychiatric evaluation using telemedicine and telehealth as provided in this
