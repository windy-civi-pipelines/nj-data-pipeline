This bill adds brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, and red dye 3 to the conditions that deem food adulterated.  Each of these chemicals is prohibited from use in processed food for sale in the European Union based on scientific studies demonstrating their risk for significant public health harm, particularly to children.
