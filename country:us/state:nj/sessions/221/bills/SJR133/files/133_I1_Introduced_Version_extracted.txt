SJR133 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 133 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS Designates October of each year as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating October of each year as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in New Jersey. Whereas, Spina bifida is a neural tube birth defect in which an area of the spinal column does not form properly, leaving a section of the spinal cord and spinal nerves exposed through an opening in the back; and Whereas, The opening in the back caused by the defect can be repaired through surgery but the nerve damage that sometimes occurs is irreparable; and Whereas, Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord that happen in fetuses within the first month of pregnancy; and Whereas, Neural tube defects are linked to folic acid deficiency before and during pregnancy; and Whereas, Spina bifida is commonly called the snowflake condition because its impact varies uniquely from person to person; and Whereas, Spina bifida occurs in 1 per 2,000 live births and is the most common central nervous system birth defect; and Whereas, Around 1,500 babies are born with spina bifida in the United States each year; and Whereas, The severity of spina bifida can range from mild with no symptoms to severe with nerve damage; and Whereas, Some people diagnosed with spina bifida may experience little to no effects of the medical condition, while others may face challenges with movement and learning development; and Whereas, The mildest and most common form of spina bifida is spina bifida occulta; and Whereas, Spina bifida occulta typically only involves a minimal portion of the spine, generally is asymptomatic, and does not require treatment.  When an infant is born with spina bifida occulta, the skin covers the deformity of the spinal bone; and Whereas, The least common type of spina bifida is known as meningocele; and Whereas, Meningocele is more severe than spina bifida occulta and occurs when the membrane surrounding the spinal cord protrudes through an opening in the spine, forming a lump or sac on the back.  Meningocele can be repaired through surgery with little or no nerve damage; and Whereas, Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida; and Whereas, For infants born with myelomeningocele, the spinal cord does not form properly and a portion of the undeveloped cord protrudes through the back. A sac containing cerebrospinal fluid and blood vessels surrounds the protruding cord, which is usually not covered by skin; and Whereas, The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown; and Whereas, A combination of genetics and environmental factors is thought to be the main cause of spina bifida; and Whereas, Surgery, physiotherapy, and medication are used to treat some of the effects of spina bifida and may be needed throughout a patient's life to prevent and manage certain complications; and Whereas, It is thought that a combination of genetic, nutritional, and environmental risk factors causes the condition. This includes having a family history of neural tube defects and getting too little folate, also known as vitamin B-9, during pregnancy; and Whereas, In New Jersey, 1.97 babies are born with spina bifida per 10,000 births; and Whereas, The most recent New Jersey State Health Assessment Data on spina bifida reported that there are 152 New Jerseyans living with the medical condition; and Whereas, Designating October of each year as Spina Bifida Awareness Month would provide New Jerseyans with an annual reminder on the effects that spina bifida has on New Jerseyans diagnosed with the birth defect; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  October of each year shall be designated as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in New Jersey to bring awareness to spina bifida and its effect on New Jerseyans diagnosed with the birth defect. 2. The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing October as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in New Jersey, and calling upon public officials and the citizens of this State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. 3. This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates October of each year as Spina Bifida Awareness Month in New Jersey.  Spina bifida is a neural tube birth defect in which an area of the spinal column does not form properly, leaving a section of the spinal cord and spinal nerves exposed through an opening in the back.  Neural tube defects are birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord that happen in fetuses within the first month of pregnancy.  Neural tube defects are linked to folic acid deficiency before and during pregnancy.  Around 1,500 babies are born with spina bifida in the United States each year.  The most recent New Jersey State Health Assessment Data on spina bifida reported that there are 152 New Jerseyans living with the medical condition.  The severity of spina bifida can range from mild with no symptoms to severe with nerve damage.  The exact cause of spina bifida is unknown.  A combination of genetics and environmental factors is thought to be the main cause of the birth defect.  Designating October of each year as Spina Bifida Awareness Month would provide New Jerseyans with an annual reminder on the effects that spina bifida has on individuals diagnosed with the birth defect.
