Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  a.  There is established the State Longitudinal Data System (SLDS).  The SLDS shall serve as the States centralized longitudinal data system for education, workforce, and related data collected by State departments, agencies, and other entities.  The system shall provide policymakers and other stakeholders with data analysis that improves individual outcomes and informs policy and program decisions. The SLDS shall be owned by the State, with oversight provided by the SLDS Governing Board established pursuant to section 2 of this act.  The SLDS shall be maintained and operated by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers, the State University. b. The purpose of the SLDS shall be to utilize existing administrative data for evidence-based policymaking that, among other public purposes: (1)  enables New Jerseyans to secure and retain employment and receive greater compensation after completing training or postsecondary degrees; (2) enables New Jerseyans to meet the education and job skill demands of business and industry; (3) identifies areas of potential workforce gaps, as presented in the annual Teacher Workforce Report; (4) identifies the effectiveness of support programs that help New Jerseyans enter or return to employment; and (5) encourages the sharing of data and learning across government entities. c.  The SLDS shall include data provided for the system by: (1) the Department of Education; (2) the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education; (3) the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority; (4) the Department of Labor and Workforce Development; and (5) any other State department, agency, or entity that enters into the SLDS as a formal partner or through a pilot project, subject to the approval by the SLDS Governing Board established pursuant to section 2 of this act and the submission of any agreements that may be necessary. d.  The Motor Vehicle Commission shall serve as an intermediary to support confirmation of education and employment data. 2.  a.  There shall be established a State Longitudinal Data System Governing Board (SLDS Governing Board), which shall be comprised of, at a minimum: (1)  the Commissioner of Education, or a designee; (2)  the Secretary of Higher Education, or a designee; (3)  the Executive Director of the Higher Education Student Assistance Authority, or a designee; (4)  the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or a designee; and (5)  the Executive Director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers, the State University, who shall serve as a non-voting, ex-officio member. b.  Members representing additional State departments, agencies, or entities that elect to participate in the SLDS as a formal partner or through a pilot program may be appointed to the governing board, subject to the approval of the board and the submission of all necessary agreements. 3.  It shall be the responsibility of the governing board to: a.  identify critical research and policy questions that need to be addressed by the States education and workforce programs; b.  identify reports and other information that should be available to education and workforce entities and other public stakeholders; c.  develop a data sharing agreement to be entered into by all partner departments, agencies, or entities of the SLDS.  The data sharing agreement shall determine the terms under which the departments, agencies, and entities share their data while adhering to all applicable federal and State laws.  The agreement shall require the environments and databases housing SLDS data be separated appropriately and structured to ensure security and compliance with the "Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974," (20 U.S.C. s.1232g), and other federal laws and guidelines, along with State requirements related to the storage of sensitive data elements and any shared data.   The agreement shall require certification by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST); d.  adopt a data access and use policy that establishes the rules for governing access, use, and re-disclosure of de-identified data collected, stored, and maintained by the SLDS.

The sponsor notes that the SLDS will be based on an existing system and continue to be housed and maintained by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. The agencies participating in the current system have worked collaboratively to establish the operational system and secure funding from several federal opportunities to expand and enhance the capacity of the States existing technology infrastructure for the purposes of developing the data system. The system will continue to be NIST-certified and follow rigorous data security guidelines, with only aggregate-level data released from the secure environment.
