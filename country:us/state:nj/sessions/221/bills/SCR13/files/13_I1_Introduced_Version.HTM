(cf: Art. V. Sec.

Certain emergency orders issued pursuant to federal law or those that only apply to the executive branch of State government would not be limited to 14 days.  The Governor could also issue orders concerning the New Jersey National Guard without a time limit. The Legislature may approve a longer period of time that emergency orders, rules, or regulations be in effect. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This constitutional amendment would limit to 14 days certain orders, rules, or regulations issued by the Governor for an emergency. Currently, State law allows the Governor to issue orders, rules, or regulations in response to an emergency.  There is no time limit on such orders, rules, or regulations. This amendment would require certain emergency orders, rules, or regulations issued by the Governor to end after 14 days. Emergency orders, rules, or regulations that apply only to the executive branch, are required by federal law, or are issued under the Governors power as head of the New Jersey National Guard are not subject to a time limit. The Legislature may approve a longer period of time that emergency orders, rules, or regulations be in effect. A yes vote would change the Constitution to limit to 14 days certain emergency orders, rules, or regulations issued by the Governor. A no vote would leave the Constitution unchanged. The Governor would continue to decide how long an emergency order, rule, or regulation will last when State law does not provide a limit. STATEMENT This constitutional amendment provides that certain emergency orders, rules, or regulations issued by the Governor during a period of a state of emergency will terminate on the 15th day following the date of issuance, unless the Legislature approves a greater period of time by way of a concurrent resolution.  The constitutional amendment prohibits the Governor from issuing an order, rule, or regulation to the same or substantially the same effect as the one terminated pursuant to the amendment for the same emergency. The constitutional amendment does not apply to orders, rules, or regulations: (1)   rescinding an order, rule, or regulation issued pursuant to the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Act, or a successor State statute; (2)   issued pursuant to direction by or agreement with the federal government, in compliance with federal law, or to the extent that application of the bill would jeopardize the receipt of federal funds by the State; (3)   applying exclusively to the executive branch; (4)   issued under the Governors authority as the Commander-in-Chief of the military and naval forces of the State; or (5)   issued pursuant to a provision of law providing for a greater period, notwithstanding that the order, rule, or regulation may also cite to an authority provided under the Civil Defense and Disaster Control Act, or a successor State statute.
