(2)   The director may also elect to purchase goods or services through a contract awarded pursuant to a nationally-recognized and accepted cooperative purchasing agreement that has been developed utilizing a competitive bidding process, in which other states participate, whenever the director determines this to be the most cost-effective method of procurement.  Prior to entering into any contract to be awarded through a nationally-recognized and accepted cooperative purchasing agreement that has been developed utilizing a competitive bidding process, the director shall review and approve the specifications and proposed terms and conditions of the contract.

(4)  A contracting unit shall purchase and contract for construction services for a public works project through a cooperative purchasing agreement only if the contract is awarded by a contracting unit in the State of New Jersey and is competitively bid in compliance with all requirements regarding public bidding, bid security, performance guarantees, insurance, and other public contracting requirements that are applicable to public works contracts.  Public works projects undertaken by a contracting unit through a cooperative purchasing agreement shall be subject to the Public Works Contractor Registration Act, P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.), and the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act, P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.). (5)  Contracting units shall not utilize time-and-materials contracts available through a cooperative purchasing agreement to undertake a public works project subject to the Public Works Contractor Registration Act, P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.), and the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act, P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.).

For purposes of this [paragraph] subsection, "contracting unit" means any county, municipality, special district, school district, fire district, State college or university, public research university, county college, or any board, commission, committee, authority or agency, which is not a State board, commission, committee, authority or agency, and which has administrative jurisdiction over any district, included or operating in whole or in part, within the territorial boundaries of any county or municipality which exercises functions which are appropriate for the exercise by one or more units of local government, and which has statutory power to make purchases and enter into contracts awarded by a contracting agent for the provision or performance of goods or services, and the New Jersey Transit Corporation created pursuant to P.L.1979, c.150 (C.27:25-1 et seq.). c.     The director may solicit bids and award contracts on behalf of this State and other jurisdictions which are parties to a cooperative purchasing agreement provided that the agreement specifies that each jurisdiction participating in a contract is solely responsible for the payment of the purchase price and cost of purchases made by it under the terms of any contract awarded pursuant to the agreement. d.    The director may promulgate rules and regulations pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), which are necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

STATEMENT This bill modifies cooperative purchasing requirements for construction services used by certain contracting units. Under current law, any contracting unit can make purchases and contract for services through the use of a nationally-recognized and accepted cooperative purchasing agreement when available and determined to have a cost savings. This bill requires that, for construction services for a public works project, cooperative purchasing agreements can only be used if the contract is awarded by a contracting unit in the State of New Jersey and is competitively bid in compliance with all requirements regarding public bidding, bid security, performance guarantees, insurance, and other public contracting requirements that are applicable to public works contracts.  Public works projects undertaken by a contracting unit through a cooperative purchasing agreement would be subject to the Public Works Contractor Registration Act and the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. The bill also prohibits the use of time-and-materials contracts that are available through a cooperative purchasing agreement by contracting units to undertake a public works project subject to the Public Works Contractor Registration Act and the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. Additionally, the bill requires contracting units that award a contract for construction services for a public works project through a cooperative purchasing agreement to verify and maintain a copy of certain contractor contact information for prevailing wage enforcement purposes.
