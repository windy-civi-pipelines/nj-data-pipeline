<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety to establish
a process by which a patient may request that the patients prescription
monitoring information include an indication that the patient should not be
prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a significant potential
for abuse or addiction.  The indication would not be included in the patients
prescription monitoring information except at the patients request. The
division would establish a process for removing the indication that a patient
should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a
significant potential for abuse or addiction, at the patients request.  The
division would also establish a method, for persons who indicate that they
should not be prescribed opioid drugs or other controlled substances with a
significant potential for abuse or addiction, to communicate this preference,
in the event that the person is incapacitated or otherwise unable to
communicate this preference prior to or while receiving health care services. 
The division would develop an education and outreach program for health care
providers concerning this process.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors belief
that permitting patients to indicate that they should not be prescribed opiates
and certain other controlled substances will facilitate the recovery process,
help patients maintain sobriety, help avoid the issuance of prescriptions for
drugs that could jeopardize the patients recovery, and assist health care
practitioners to identify patients who are at risk of abusing or diverting
prescription medications.  </p>
