Under current law, qualifying taxpayers with $150,000 or less in gross income who are at least 62 years old or disabled may exclude certain pension and retirement income from taxable gross income, up to a certain amount, depending on filing status.  The bill expands eligibility for the exclusion to qualifying taxpayers with incomes in excess of $150,000, so that all qualifying taxpayers may claim a full or partial exclusion, regardless of income.

Under current law, a qualifying taxpayer with an annual income of $100,000 or less is allowed an exclusion as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly Up to $100,000 Married filing separately Up to $50,000 Single Up to $75,000 For a qualifying taxpayer whose income exceeds $100,000 but is less than or equal to $125,000, current law allows the taxpayer to claim an exclusion from gross income as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly 50 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Married filing separately 25 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Single 37.5 percent of pension payments and other retirement income For a qualifying taxpayer whose income exceeds $125,000 but is less than or equal to $150,000, current law allows the taxpayer to claim an exclusion from gross income as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly 25 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Married filing separately 12.5 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Single 18.75 percent of pension payments and other retirement income

STATEMENT This bill (1) expands eligibility for the partial gross income tax exclusion on pension and retirement income to certain taxpayers with gross incomes exceeding $150,000, and (2) increases the amount of the exclusion that qualifying taxpayers may claim. Under current law, qualifying taxpayers with $150,000 or less in gross income who are at least 62 years old or disabled may exclude certain pension and retirement income from taxable gross income, up to a certain amount, depending on filing status.  The bill expands eligibility for the exclusion to qualifying taxpayers with incomes in excess of $150,000, so that all qualifying taxpayers may claim a full or partial exclusion, regardless of income. The bill also increases the amount of the pension and retirement and income exclusion by allowing qualifying taxpayers to exempt the first $150,000 of pension payments and other retirement income as well as 50 percent of any payments exceeding $150,000 up to $300,000 during a taxable year.  A taxpayer would not be permitted to claim an exemption for any payments exceeding $300,000. Under current law, a qualifying taxpayer with an annual income of $100,000 or less is allowed an exclusion as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly Up to $100,000 Married filing separately Up to $50,000 Single Up to $75,000 For a qualifying taxpayer whose income exceeds $100,000 but is less than or equal to $125,000, current law allows the taxpayer to claim an exclusion from gross income as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly 50 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Married filing separately 25 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Single 37.5 percent of pension payments and other retirement income For a qualifying taxpayer whose income exceeds $125,000 but is less than or equal to $150,000, current law allows the taxpayer to claim an exclusion from gross income as follows: Filer Type Amount of Exclusion Married filing jointly 25 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Married filing separately 12.5 percent of pension payments and other retirement income Single 18.75 percent of pension payments and other retirement income
