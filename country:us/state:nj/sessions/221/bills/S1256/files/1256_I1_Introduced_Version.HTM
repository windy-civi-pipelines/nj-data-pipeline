<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.2019,
c.382 (C.19:31-6.4c) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Notwithstanding any
other provision of law to the contrary, a person who is qualified to register
to vote may submit a voter registration form electronically on a secure
Internet website maintained by the Secretary of State, if the applicant has an
email address and provides a valid New Jersey driver's license number, a valid
New Jersey nondriver identification card number, or the last four digits of the
applicant's Social Security number. The voter registration form shall contain
substantively the same information required to be contained on a paper voter
registration form pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4).  <u>The
voter registration form available electronically shall enable a person who is
qualified to register to vote, and a person who is registered to vote, to apply
for and receive a mail-in ballot as provided under section 3 of P.L.2009, c.79
(C.19:63-3), until the voter requests otherwise. </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The Secretary of State
shall apply the same voter registration deadline applicable under current law
for paper voter registration forms to an online voter registration form
submitted by an applicant pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The applicant completing
the form shall affirmatively attest to the truth of the information provided in
the form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For voter registration
purposes, the applicant shall affirmatively assent to the use of his or her
signature from his or her driver's license or non-driver identification card or
the applicant's digitized or electronic signature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    For each online voter
registration form, the Secretary of State shall obtain either an electronic
copy of the applicant's signature from his or her driver's license or
non-driver identification card directly from the New Jersey Motor Vehicle
Commission, or the applicant's digitized or electronic signature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Upon submission of an
online voter registration form pursuant to this section, the electronic voter
registration system shall automatically acknowledge that the online voter
registration form has been submitted successfully, and provide instructions on
how the person completing the voter registration form may follow-up on the
status of the submission either online or by contacting the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>appropriate county commissioner of
registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The Secretary of State
shall employ security measures to ensure the accuracy and integrity of voter
registration forms submitted electronically pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The New Jersey Motor
Vehicle Commission and the Secretary of State shall jointly develop a process
and the infrastructure to allow the electronic copy of the applicant's
signature and other information required under this section that is in the
possession of the commission to be transferred to the Secretary of State and to
the appropriate county election officials to allow a person who is qualified to
register to vote in New Jersey to register to vote under this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    If an applicant cannot
electronically submit the information required pursuant to this section, the
applicant shall nevertheless be able to complete the online voter registration
form electronically on the Secretary of State's Internet website, print a paper
copy of the completed form, and mail or deliver the paper copy of the completed
form to the Secretary of State or the appropriate county election official. 
For the purposes of this subsection, the applicant shall be required to provide
the same documents required to be provided with a paper voter registration form
pursuant to R.S.19:31-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2019, c.382, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-3) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

shall be entitled to vote using a mail-in ballot:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   in all future elections,
including general elections, held in this State, in which the voter is eligible
to vote; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   in any single election
held in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The qualified voter who
chooses the option to vote using a mail-in ballot in all future elections shall
be furnished with such a ballot by the county clerk without further request on
the part of the voter and until the voter requests in writing that the voter no
longer be sent a mail-in ballot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The mail-in ballot application
form prepared by the Secretary of State shall present the two options in the
order provided above. The mail-in ballot application shall also provide spaces
for the voter's telephone number and email address, including language
informing the voter that this contact information will be used to contact the
voter concerning the acceptance or rejection of the ballot, and how the voter
may cure a defect. A voter's telephone number and email address shall not be
subject to public disclosure and shall not be considered a government record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The additional direct
expenditures required for the implementation of the provisions of this
subsection as amended by section 1 of P.L.2018, c.72 shall be offset pursuant
to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.459 (C.19:63-29).</p>

voter may apply to the person designated in section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79
(C.19:63-5), for a mail-in ballot. The application shall be in writing, shall
be signed by the applicant and shall state the applicant's place of voting
residence and the address to which the ballot shall be sent. The Secretary of
