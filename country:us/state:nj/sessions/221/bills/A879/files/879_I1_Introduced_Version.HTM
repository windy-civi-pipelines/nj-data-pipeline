of each drinking water outlet in each school for the presence of lead.  Each
test for lead shall be conducted by a laboratory certified for this purpose by
the commissioner, in accordance with the sampling and testing methods specified
in the technical guidance.  The initial test for lead shall be conducted no

shall immediately close off access to that outlet and report the test results
to the department.  The school district, charter school, or nonpublic school,
in consultation with the department, shall conduct follow-up testing, as
provided in the technical guidance, to determine the source of the lead, and
take appropriate remedial measures to ensure that students are not exposed to
water with an elevated lead level and have access to free, fresh, and clean
drinking water at the school.  Such remedial measures may include, but need not
be limited to: permanently shutting or closing off access to the drinking water
outlet; providing an alternative source of water; manual or automatic flushing
of the drinking water outlet; installing and maintaining a filter at the
drinking water outlet; and repairing or replacing the drinking water outlet,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require public
and nonpublic schools to test for and remediate lead in drinking water, and
disclose their test results. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, under the bill,
each school district, charter school, and nonpublic school would be required to
undertake periodic testing of each drinking water outlet in each school for the
presence of lead.  The tests would be conducted by a certified laboratory in
accordance with the sampling and testing methods specified in the United States
Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) technical guidance for reducing lead in
drinking water at schools, or more protective guidance issued by the Department
of Environmental Protection (DEP).  The initial tests would be conducted no
later than 90 days after the effective date of the bill, and subsequent tests
would be conducted every five years thereafter, unless the DEP determines, on a
case-by-case basis, that more or less frequent testing is necessary or
sufficient to protect the public health.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A school district, charter school,
or nonpublic school may obtain an exemption from the requirement to conduct
initial testing if it demonstrates to the DEP that it has conducted testing
that substantially complies with the technical guidance within two years prior
to the effective date of the bill, and any drinking water outlet that was found
to have an elevated lead level has either been removed from service or
remediated.  Under the bill, a school district, charter school, or nonpublic
school may seek the assistance of a local health agency or public water system
to help ensure compliance with the bill.  Nothing in the bill would prevent a
school district, charter school, or nonpublic school from conducting more
frequent testing than required by the bill.  The testing requirements would not
apply to a school district, charter school, or nonpublic school that is
considered a public water system under federal law and meets the applicable
standards for lead in drinking water. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If testing conducted pursuant
to the bill reveals an elevated lead level at a drinking water outlet, the
school district, charter school, or nonpublic school would be required to
immediately close off access to that outlet and report the test results to the
DEP.  The school district, charter school, or nonpublic school, in consultation
with the DEP, would be required to conduct follow-up testing to determine the
source of the lead, and take appropriate remedial measures to ensure that
students are not exposed to water with an elevated lead level and have access
to free, fresh, and clean drinking water.  Remedial measures may include
permanently shutting or closing off access to the drinking water outlet,
providing an alternative source of water, manual or automatic flushing,
installing and maintaining a filter, and replacing outlets, plumbing, or
service lines contributing to the elevated lead level. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, each school
district, charter school, and nonpublic school would be required to submit to
the DEP, the Department of Education, and the Department of Health information
on its testing activities, including the date the testing was completed, the
location and type of each drinking water outlet tested, the results of each
test, and any measures being taken to remediate a drinking water outlet found
to have an elevated lead level.  School districts, charter schools, and
nonpublic schools would be required to maintain copies of this information in a
suitable location and on their Internet websites, and notify relevant parent,
teacher, and employee organizations of the availability of the information. 
School districts, charter schools, and nonpublic schools would also be required
to designate a person to serve as the contact person for communications with
the DEP and the public.  If test results reveal an elevated lead level at a
drinking water outlet, the school would be required to immediately notify
teachers, other school personnel, and parents directly.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
DEP, within 30 days after the effective date of the bill, to provide to each school
district, charter school, and nonpublic school with the EPAs technical
guidance for reducing lead in drinking water at schools, a summary of the
sampling and testing methods contained in the technical guidance, a list of
each laboratory in the State certified to conduct lead testing, and any other
information the DEP deems relevant.</p>
