STATEMENT This bill makes it a crime of the fourth degree for registered sex offenders to reside within 1,000 feet of their victims home or workplace. The residential ban established under the bill would not apply to a sex offender who is serving a sentence at a jail, prison, juvenile facility, or other correctional institution or facility that is located within 1,000 feet of the victims home or workplace; is receiving treatment at a mental health facility located within 1,000 feet of the victims home or workplace; or established the residence prior to the bills effective date. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. It is the sponsors intent in introducing this bill to close a loophole in Megans Law which does not explicitly prohibit a sex offender from residing near his or her victim.  At least five other states (Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia) have enacted laws prohibiting sex offenders from residing within a certain distance of their victims, and Oklahoma has introduced similar legislation.
