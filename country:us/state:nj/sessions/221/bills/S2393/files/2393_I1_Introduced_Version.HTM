TURNER District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Mandates that certain personnel critical to certain State finance and revenue generating activities are essential employees during state of emergency or government shutdown. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act mandating that certain personnel critical to preserve and protect the States finances and revenue generating operations are essential employees during certain declared State government emergencies, and supplementing P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A:9-33 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Notwithstanding any provision of law, rule, regulation or order to the contrary, in the event of a state of emergency declaration by the Governor or the failure of the Governor and the Legislature to enact a general appropriation law by the beginning of a State fiscal year, State employees of all departments, agencies and commissions responsible for critical activities necessary to preserve and protect the States financial assets, resources, and revenue generating operations that are licensed by the State shall be determined by the head of each department, agency and commission to be essential employees.  Employees so designated shall report to work and perform such duties and responsibilities as the respective department, agency or commission head shall direct. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill clarifies the authority of the executive branch under the emergency management act to determine that personnel critical to preserving and protecting the States financial assets and resources, and State revenue generating activities that are licensed by the State are essential employees during a state of emergency or when the State fails to meet its constitutional obligation to enact a State budget act for a fiscal year. This bill ensures that, in the event of a state of emergency or a State government shutdown, State personnel that are critical to preserving and protecting the States financial assets, resources, and revenue generating operations that are licensed by the State will continue to work.  This will ensure that all tax liabilities that arise from State licensed activities will be appropriately collected and safeguarded.  This bill will avoid uncertainties concerning the continued operation of such activities and ensure that State revenue collections essential to reestablishing the functioning of State government at the conclusion of a state of emergency or any budget impasse will be fully functioning.
