Four years following the grant programs establishment, the commissioner will submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature on the outcomes of the grant program that includes a recommendation on the establishment of a permanent source of funding for such career and technical education partnership programs. The grant program established pursuant to this bill is modeled on the County Vocational School District Partnership Grant Program established pursuant to P.L.2014, c.73 (C.18A:6-132 et seq.).  Grants were provided pursuant to that four-year grant program in FY 2015 through FY 2018 and were available only to county vocational school districts.  The grant program established under this bill would permit school districts that operate approved career and technical education programs or programs of study to also be eligible to receive the grants.
