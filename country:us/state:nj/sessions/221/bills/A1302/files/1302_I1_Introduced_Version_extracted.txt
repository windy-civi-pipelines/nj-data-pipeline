All codes, rules and regulations heretofore adopted by the Air Pollution Control Commission shall continue in full force and effect subject to the power of the department to amend and repeal such codes, rules and regulations as provided by [this act] P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.). b.    Unless otherwise required by federal law, rule or regulation, no code, regulation, rule or standard may be adopted by the department that diminishes the efficacy of a hospital or medical disinfectant in killing or inactivating agents of infectious diseases, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the volatile organic compound content or emissions caused by the use of such products.  No federal requirement to reduce volatile organic compound content or emissions in general may be construed to permit the department to regulate the volatile organic compounds found in, or released in the use of, a hospital or medical disinfectant, unless the federal law, rule or regulation establishing the federal requirement specifically requires the reduction of volatile organic compounds found in, or released in the use of,  hospital or medical disinfectants. c.  The department shall have the power to regulate air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from activities at regulated warehouses, in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.          ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf:  P.L.1999, c.100, s.2) 3.  (New section) a.  No regulated warehouse in the State shall operate unless the owner or operator of the warehouse possesses a valid permit issued by the department pursuant to the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.). b.  The department shall develop and implement a permit program to effectuate the provisions of this section.  A permit issued to a regulated warehouse pursuant to this section shall require the owner or operator of a regulated warehouse to demonstrate to the department's satisfaction that the activities at the regulated warehouse result in emissions of no more than 100 tons of greenhouse gases annually, measured as carbon dioxide equivalent.  The measurement shall: (1) include emissions from emitting vehicle traffic generated by the warehouse; and (2) factor in, as an offset, any carbon credits purchased by the owner or operator of the warehouse during the measurement year, provided that the department determines that the carbon credits represent genuine carbon sequestration. c.  The department shall possess the same powers to administer and enforce the provisions of this section as it possesses with respect to the other provisions of the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.), including, but not limited to, the power to collect administrative fees pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-9) and the power to enter premises pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1962, c.212 (C.26:2C-9.1). d.  An owner or operator of a regulated warehouse that violates the provisions of this section shall be deemed to have violated the provisions of the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.), and shall be subject to the same penalties as provided in section 19 of P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-19). e.  The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary to implement the provisions of this section. 4.    This act shall take effect 18 months after the date of enactment, except that the Department of Environmental Protection may take any anticipatory administrative action, in advance of the effective date, as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would require certain warehouses to obtain a permit under the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," P.L.1954, c.212 (C.26:2C-1 et seq.) before being allowed to operate in the State. Specifically, the bill would apply to warehouses that are 100,000 square feet or larger and generate 500 or more vehicle trips per working day.  The vehicle trips would include employees commuting to and from work, in addition to truck traffic.  However, the vehicle trips would exclude trips made by zero-emission vehicles. Under the permit program, the owner or operator of a regulated warehouse would be required to demonstrate to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) that the warehouse generates no more than 100 tons of greenhouse gases per year.  The owner or operator could purchase carbon credits to offset the warehouse's emissions, provided that DEP deems the credits to be legitimate.  The requirement to obtain a permit would begin 18 months after the date the bill is enacted into law.  The permit requirement would apply to any existing or newly constructed warehouse that is covered under the bill. The bill would provide that the DEP has the same powers to administer and enforce the permit program as it has under the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)," and a violation of the bill's provisions would constitute a violation of the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)."  Persons who violate the "Air Pollution Control Act (1954)" may be liable to a civil administrative penalty of not more than $10,000 for the first offense, not more than $25,000 for the second offense, and not more than $50,000 for the third and each subsequent offense.
