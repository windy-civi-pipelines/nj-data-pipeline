In the early summer of 2019, the Department of Environmental Protection detected cyanobacteria, a form of harmful algal bloom, in Lake Hopatcong and subsequently advised against making any contact with the water.  Exposure to these harmful algal blooms can cause a range of health effects, including rashes, allergy-like reactions, flu-like symptoms, gastroenteritis, respiratory irritation, skin rashes and eye irritation.  A major contributor to harmful algal blooms is excessive nutrient loading in the water caused by runoff into Lake Hopatcong.  This bill provides funding to the Lake Hopatcong Commission to address the current harmful algal bloom, and to take steps to prevent further harmful algal blooms from occurring in the future.
