CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning smart meters and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  As used in P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Public utility means the same as that term is defined in R.S.48:2-13. Smart meter means a metering device that employs smart meter technology to measure, record, and transmit utility usage data to both a public utility and a customer for billing and other purposes.  Smart meter shall include a basic hourly interval meter, a meter with one-way communication, and a real-time meter with built-in, two-way communication capable of recording and transmitting instantaneous utility usage data. b.    A public utility shall not impose upon or collect a fee from any person for not installing a smart meter in the persons place of residence. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits public utilities in this State from charging or collecting an opt-out fee to persons that have chosen not to have a smart meter installed in their places of residence. Under the bill, a smart meter is defined as a metering device that employs smart meter technology to measure, record, and transmit utility usage data to both a public utility and a customer for billing and other purposes.  Smart meter includes a basic hourly interval meter, a meter with one-way communication, and a real-time meter with built-in, two-way communication capable of recording and transmitting instantaneous utility usage data. It is the sponsors intent to help utility customers control their utility costs by exempting them from the fee charged by utilities for opting out of smart meter installation.  Currently, residential customers are required to either agree to install a smart meter or pay a monthly fee to keep their analog meter.  Utility customers have been experiencing larger and larger bills as companies save money by reducing employee costs.  It is the sponsors intent that that this legislation will promote choice in selecting a meter and save ratepayers money if they choose to keep an analog meter.
