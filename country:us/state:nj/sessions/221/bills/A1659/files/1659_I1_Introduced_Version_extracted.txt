(2)   In any other state or jurisdiction, of conduct which, if committed in New Jersey, would constitute any of the crimes or disorderly persons offenses described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, no person shall be disqualified from certification on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check performed pursuant to sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a) if the person has affirmatively demonstrated to the board clear and convincing evidence of the person's rehabilitation.  In determining whether a person has affirmatively demonstrated rehabilitation, the following factors shall be considered: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted person would hold, has held or currently holds, as the case may be; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the offense occurred; (4)   the date of the offense; (5)   the age of the person when the offense was committed; (6)   whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (7)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the offense; and (8)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the person under their supervision. c.     If a person subject to the provisions of sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a criminal history record background check, the board shall, as applicable: (1)   not issue a nurse aide certification and shall notify the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of section 20 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or the applicant's prospective employer if known, of that denial; or (2)   revoke the person's current nurse aide certification and notify the person, and the person's employer, if known, of that revocation. 20.  (New section)  a.  An applicant for certification, or a certified nurse aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 19 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall submit to the board that individual's name, address, and fingerprints taken on standard fingerprint cards by a State or municipal law enforcement agency.  The board is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Division of State Police for use in making the determinations required by sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Upon receipt of the criminal history record information for a person from the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Division of State Police, the board shall immediately notify, in writing, the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of this section or the applicant's prospective employer if known, or a certified nurse aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and that person's employer, as applicable, of the person's qualification or disqualification for certification under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). If the person is disqualified, the conviction or convictions which constitute the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the notice to the person, but shall not be identified in the notice to the person's employer or prospective employer. c.     The person who is the subject of the background check shall have 30 days from the date of the written notice of disqualification to petition the board for a hearing on the accuracy of the person's criminal history record information or to establish the person's rehabilitation under subsection b. of section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The board shall notify the person's employer or prospective employer of the person's petition for a hearing within five days following the receipt of the petition from the person.  Upon the issuance of a final decision upon a petition to the board pursuant to this subsection, the board shall notify the person and the person's employer or prospective employer as to whether the person remains disqualified from certification under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature). d.    An applicant for certification may be issued conditional certification and may be employed as a nurse aide conditionally for a period not to exceed 60 days, pending completion of a criminal history record background check required under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature) by the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety based upon an examination of its own files in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), and for an additional period not to exceed 60 days pending completion of a criminal history record background check by federal authorities as arranged for by the Division of State Police pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), if the person submits to the board a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A person who submits a false sworn statement shall be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide, as the case may be, and shall not have an opportunity to establish rehabilitation pursuant to subsection b. of section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). A conditionally employed person, or an employed person certified as a nurse aide, who disputes the accuracy of the criminal history record information and who files a petition requesting a hearing pursuant to subsection c. of this section may remain employed by that person's employer until the board rules on the person's petition but, pending the board's ruling, the employer shall not permit the person to have unsupervised contact with patients, residents, or clients, as the case may be, who are 60 years of age or older. e. (1) A licensed health care facility or other entity that has received an application from or conditionally employs an applicant for nurse aide certification, or employs a certified nurse aide, shall be immune from liability for disclosing that disqualification or termination in good faith to another licensed health care facility or other entity that is qualified by statute or regulation to employ the person as a nurse aide, provided that the licensed health care facility or other entity: (a)   receives notice from the board that the applicant or certified nurse aide, as applicable, has been determined by the board to be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide pursuant to sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature); or (b)   terminates its employment of a conditionally employed applicant for nurse aide certification or a certified nurse aide because the person was disqualified from employment at the health care facility or other entity on the basis of a conviction of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) after commencing employment at the health care facility or other entity. (2)   A licensed health care facility or other entity which discloses information pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be presumed to be acting in good faith unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the health care facility or other entity acted with actual malice toward the person who is the subject of the information. f. (1) A licensed health care facility or other entity, upon receiving notice from the board that a person employed by it as a nurse aide, including a conditionally employed person, has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) after commencing employment at the health care facility or other entity, shall: (a)   immediately terminate the person's employment as a nurse aide; and (b)   report information about the termination to the board in a manner prescribed by the board, who shall thereupon deem the person to be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection. (2)   A licensed health care facility or other entity shall be immune from liability for any actions taken in good faith pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and shall be presumed to be acting in good faith unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the health care facility or other entity acted with actual malice toward the employee. (3)   The person terminated from employment pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall have 30 days from the date of the termination to petition the board for a hearing on the accuracy of the information about the conviction reported to the board or to establish why the person should not be terminated from employment, and disqualified from certification, as a nurse aide.

(New section) The Department of Law and Public Safety shall assume the cost of the criminal history record background check conducted on an applicant for nurse aide certification, or a certified nurse aide, as the case may be, pursuant to sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature) and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a). 22.  (New section) Any person submitting a false sworn statement pursuant to section 20 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000, which may be assessed by the board. 23.  (New section) An individual certified as a nurse aide by another state or territory of the United States may apply to have that certification entered on the registry established and maintained by the board pursuant to section 20 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), provided that: a.     the board receives documentation from the other state or territory that the applicant holds a current, valid certification as a nurse aide in the state or territory; b.    the applicant has not been convicted of any crimes and has no documented findings of abuse, neglect, or misappropriation of resident property in the other state or territory; c.     the applicant complies with the criminal history record background check requirements set forth under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and d.

STATEMENT This bill implements certain measures to support nurses and the nursing workforce, and transfers oversight over certified nurse aides (CNAs) from the Department of Health (DOH) to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, effective on the first day of the 19th month next following the enactment of this bill.  Specifically, the bill establishes requirements for the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) to develop new graduate nursing residency programs; increases State funding for the NJCCN; requires hospitals to establish Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Councils; establishes a Nursing School Expansion Grant Program; requires the New Jersey Nursing Emotional Well-Being Institute (NJ-NEW) to establish a program of services and a peer support helpline to promote the mental health and emotional well-being of nurses and their families; establishes annual survey requirements for nurses, homemaker-home health aides (HHAs) and CNAs, as well as for schools that offer nurse training programs and HHA and CNA training programs; and establishes a gross income tax credit for preceptors of certain nursing students. Graduate Nursing Residency Programs This bill establishes a program through which facilities for acute care, long-term care, public health, ambulatory care, home care and hospice providers, and other qualifying facilities or providers may apply to receive financial, material and technical support from the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) to implement a residency program for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses, or one of these professions. To manage the operations of the program, the bill appropriates $500,000 to NJCCN. The NJCCN is to appoint an advisory committee of stakeholders for consultation to effectuate the purposes of the bill. Among the stakeholders to be appointed are two NJCCN representatives; one representative of the New Jersey Board of Nursing who is either a licensed practical nurse or a registered professional nurse; one licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse representing a unionized facility; representatives of various health care facility and provider associations; and two representatives of different academic nursing programs. The bill grants authority to the NJCCN to adjust membership of the advisory committee upon periodic review of the needs of residency programs for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses. The NJCCN is to consult with the advisory committee to 1) establish and update, as necessary, requirements for a residency program and 2) establish criteria for eligibility of facilities and providers to participate in the program created in accordance with the bill. Requirements for a residency program are to include, at a minimum: 1) a 12-month timeline for a residency; 2) a full-time schedule for residents; 3) support for residents by a preceptor or mentor; and 4) collection of data by the facility or provider to send to the NJCCN regarding the number of individuals who completed a residency program with the facility or provider and remained at the facility or with the provider after residency completion for full-time employment. To participate in the NJCCN program, facilities and providers are to file an application that includes information on           1) the number of spots to be offered in the facility or providers residency program; 2) the type of facility or provider seeking approval; and 3) whether the facility or providers residency program is newly established or being updated. Approval of an application will be made on a first-come, first-serve basis, with priority given to long-term care facilities and home care providers. Upon approval of an application, the New Jersey Board of Nursing will provide funding to the NJCCN to offer the financial, material and technical support to the approved facility or provider, in an amount determined based on various criteria, including, but not limited to, the information submitted in the application on the number of spots in a residency program, the type of facility, and if the residency program is new or being updated. The bill directs that at no time is the New Jersey Board of Nursing to allocate an amount exceeding $4 million annually to the NJCCN for the financial, material and technical support to facilities and providers participating in the program created in the bill. Lastly, a biannual report currently required of the NJCCN to submit to the Governor and Legislature is to now include various data on the residency programs established for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses. New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing Funding The bill amends current law to provide that an amount equal to at least $515,000 of the initial and renewal licensing fees charged by the New Jersey Board of Nursing for professional and practical nurses is dedicated to funding, and annually appropriated to, the NJCCN.  Under current law, five percent of the initial and renewal licensing fees charged by the board are dedicated to funding, and annually appropriated to, the NJCCN.  Under this bill, the NJCCN will annually receive five percent, or $515,000, whichever amount is greater. Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Council Program The bill requires the Department of Health to require each hospital in this State, as a condition of licensure, to establish a Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Council, either by establishing a new council or assigning the functions of the council to a similar existing entity within the hospital. Each council will serve the purpose of: (1)  providing nurses with representation on matters concerning the establishment of healthy work environments and human resource allocation; (2)  creating a forum of participatory leadership; and (3)  supporting the equal participation of nurses and hospital management in hospital decisions affecting nurses. The bill requires that at least 51 percent of the members of each council will be registered nurses that spend at least 50 percent of work time in direct patient care.  Each council will contain a sufficient amount of members to provide adequate representation of all the nurses working in the hospital.  Each council will have a Chief Nursing Officer and a direct care nurse who will serve as the co-chairs of the council.  The selection of the registered nurses will be according to the collective bargaining agreement, if there is one in effect at the hospital.  If there is no applicable collective bargaining agreement, the members of the council who are registered nurses will be selected by their peers.  The members of the council who are hospital administrative staff will be appointed by each councils Chief Nursing Officer. Participation in the council by a hospital employee will be on scheduled work time and compensated at the appropriate rate of pay. Council members will be relieved of all other work duties during meetings of the council.  Each council member will be required to complete the curriculum provided by the Organization of Nurse Leaders of New Jersey Nursing Workplace Environment Commission program or a similar process defined in a collective bargaining agreement. Each council will develop an annual plan concerning nurse staffing and the creation of a positive work environment for nurses within the hospital.  The plan will be based on the needs of patients and be used as a primary component of the staffing budget.  Each council will provide the annual plan to the Chief Nursing Officer for budget planning. The plan will: (a)  not diminish other standards contained in State or federal law and rules, or the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, if any, between the hospital and a representative of the  nursing staff; and (b)  provide for exemptions for some or all requirements of the plan during a state of emergency, as defined in section 23 of P.L.2011, c.19 (C.5:12-45.3), if the hospital is requested or expected to provide an exceptional level of emergency or other medical services. The Department of Health will be responsible for ensuring that each council is in compliance and will review the plan as necessary. Nursing Education Program Grants The bill establishes the Nursing School Expansion Grant Program, which will be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Under the bill, the program will provide grants to eligible nursing education programs in the State to increase their capacity and improve the supply of the nursing workforce.  The bill also appropriates $25 million from the General Fund to the authority for the bills purposes. Under the bill, an eligible nursing education program may submit an application for grant funding through the program to the Chief Executive Officer.  An application is required to include information and data, in such form and in such manner as is required by the Chief Executive Officer, on: (1)   the enrollment and graduation rates for the three academic years preceding the date of the application; (2) the projected plan to increase enrollment and graduation targets; (3) the demographic profile of current students, faculty, and staff and specific plans to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce; (4) any plans for faculty expansions in order to meet the needs of an increased student body; (5) any partnerships, connections, or pathways between licensed practical nursing programs, diploma or certificate programs, associates degree programs, baccalaureate degree programs, and graduate level programs in nursing and nursing education; (6) student pass rates for examinations administered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing; and (7) such other information as the Chief Executive Officer may require. The bill directs the Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing, to develop criteria for the evaluation of applications for grants. Based upon the criteria developed, and within the limit of available appropriations, the Chief Executive Officer will award grants to eligible nursing education programs in such amounts as the officer determines. The bill directs the authority to issue grants in the amount of $24,500,000 and provides that no more than $500,000 may be expended by the authority for the administrative costs of the program. Nurse Emotional Well-Being and Mental Health Support The bill requires the New Jersey Nursing Emotional Well-Being Institute (NJ-NEW) in the NJCCN to establish a program of services designed to promote the mental health and emotional well-being of nurses, as well as to provide a nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline. Specifically, NJ-NEW will be required to establish a program of services designed to promote the mental health and well-being of nurses licensed in New Jersey and their families and prevent the psychological and physical sequelae of stress.  At a minimum, the program will: (1)   encourage all health care facilities in the State that employ nurses to access the NJ-NEW Schwartz Rounds program; (2)   work to make virtual Schwartz rounds available to all nurses in the State on at least a monthly basis; (3)   coordinate with nursing associations, mental health associations, and community organizations to facilitate a Statewide NJ-NEW well-being hub, which will comprise learning collaboratives that offer strategies to prevent work-related stress from causing physical and emotional symptoms, provide educational resources, and provide consultation services for health care organizations in New Jersey to promote emotional well-being for nurses and their families; (4)   provide stress first aid training or establish partnerships with stress first aid training providers to support health care organizations in promoting emotional well-being and resiliency for nurses and their families; (5)   establish an online repository of Statewide emotional well-being and mental health resources and referrals for nurses and their families; and (6)   establish any other evidence-based initiatives that meet the ongoing emotional well-being and mental health needs of nurses and their families. The bill additionally requires NJ-NEW and the University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, to provide a toll-free nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline, or a similar helpline.  The helpline is to be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and respond to calls from nurses and their family members.  The staff of the helpline will provide counselling and support to callers, seek to identify the nurses and their family members who should be referred for further support and counseling services, and provide informational resources.  The helpline is to partner with the Statewide NJ-NEW well-being hub established under the bill to provide callers with resources and skill sets to prevent situations that cause stress and the psychological and physical sequelae of stress. The operators of the helpline are to be trained by University Behavioral Healthcare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey and, to the greatest extent possible, be current or former nurses who are: (1)   familiar with post-traumatic stress disorder and the emotional and psychological tensions, depressions, and anxieties unique to nurses and their family members; or (2)   trained to provide counseling services involving marriage and family life, substance abuse, personal stress management, and other emotional or psychological disorders or conditions which may be likely to adversely affect the personal and profession-related well-being of nurses and their family members. NJ-NEW and University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, are to provide for the confidentiality of the names of the callers, the information discussed, and any referrals for further peer support or counseling; provided, however, that NJ-NEW and Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, may establish guidelines providing for the tracking of any person who exhibits a severe emotional or psychological disorder or condition which the operator handling the call reasonably believes might result in harm to the nurse, family member, or any other person. University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, will maintain a list of credentialed resources and behavioral health care providers throughout the State, and provide case management services to ensure that nurses and their family members receive ongoing counseling and a continuum of care in New Jersey.  The continuum of services will be required to utilize applicable State and federal guidelines while providing ongoing peer support. The bill appropriates from the General Fund to NJ-NEW the sum of $1,200,000 for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the bill.  Of this amount, NJ-NEW will be required to use $300,000 to support the nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline.  The bill directs that there be annually appropriated to NJ-NEW from the General Fund such sums as are sufficient to support the operations of NJ-NEW and the initiatives undertaken by NJ-NEW pursuant to the bill. Workforce and Training Program Survey Requirements The bill codifies certain existing surveys for nurses and creates new surveys for homemaker-home health aides (HHAs) and CNAs, as well as for schools that offer nurse training programs and HHA and CNA training programs. Specifically, the survey for nurses, HHAs, and CNAs will solicit information concerning:  1) the persons licensure or certification status; 2) the persons demographic information, including age, race, ethnicity, and gender; 3) the persons educational background; 4) the persons employment status; 5) the persons primary employment setting; 6) the type of position held by the person; and any other information as may be required.  Nurses will additionally be asked whether the nurse is licensed under the multistate Nurse Licensure Compact and whether, during the course of the prior year, the nurse provided professional services in other states under the compact.  The survey is to be completed by the professional in connection with the professionals initial licensure or certification and in connection with the renewal of the professionals license or certification. The survey for schools that offer training programs for nurses will include programs that offer a diploma, an associates degree, a baccalaureate degree, or an advanced degree in nursing, as well as licensed practical nurse training programs. The nurse training program survey and the surveys for HHA and CNA training programs will solicit the following information:  1) the number of applicants rejected by the school or program; 2) the total number of available slots at the school or program; 3) the total number of qualified candidates who applied to the school or program; 4) the total number of current enrollees in the school or program; 5) graduation rates from the school or program; 6) in the case of nursing schools, pass rates for program graduates for the National Council Licensure Examination; 7) demographic information concerning current students and faculty, including data concerning age, race, ethnicity, and gender;  8) faculty vacancy rates; 9) the total number of faculty employed; 10) the educational background of faculty members; and 11)  such other information as may be required.  The survey is to be completed by the school or training program no later than July 1 of each year. The New Jersey Board of Nursing and the DOH will be required to develop and annually review the surveys required under the bill in collaboration with the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) until oversight of CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing pursuant to the bill on the first day of the 19th month next following the enactment of the bill; thereafter, the New Jersey Board of Nursing will develop and review all the surveys required under the bill. The New Jersey Board of Nursing will ensure compliance with the nurse and HHA survey requirements and, following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH, CNAs and CNA training program survey requirements.  Until oversight of CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the DOH will ensure compliance with CNA and CNA training program survey requirements.  The NJCCN and New Jersey Board of Nursing will ensure compliance with the survey requirements for schools with nurse training programs and HHA training programs and, following transfer of oversight over CNAs from the DOH, CNA training programs.  The New Jersey Board of Nursing and DOH will each be required to take appropriate disciplinary action against entities within their respective jurisdictions that fail to complete the survey.  A survey will not be deemed complete unless all survey questions are answered. The New Jersey Board of Nursing will transmit de-identified nurse and HHA survey data, and following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH, CNA survey data, to the NJCCN, which will analyze the data and produce an annual aggregate report.  The NJCCN will additionally analyze and produce an annual aggregate report of nursing school and HHA training program survey data, as well as CNA training program survey data following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH.  Until oversight of CNAs is transferred to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the DOH will be required to analyze CNA and CNA training program survey data and produce an annual aggregate report; however, the department will be authorized to contract with the NJCCN to analyze the data and produce the report, the costs of which will be offset by the department furnishing the NJCCN with five percent of CNA licensure fees collected for the current reporting period. The reports of survey data for nurses, HHAs, schools that offer training programs for nurses, and HHA training programs will be made available on the Internet websites of the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the NJCCN.  The CNA and CNA training program reports will be made available on the Internet websites of the DOH and the NJCCN until transfer of oversight over CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, at which point CNA and CNA training program reports will be made available on the Internet websites of the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the NJCCN. Transferring Oversight of CNAs to New Jersey Board of Nursing This bill modifies current law governing CNAs by transferring the regulation of CNAs from the New Jersey Department of Health to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Under the bill, references to CNAs in the law currently governing the profession and references to CNAs in law attributing the oversight of CNAs to the Department of Health are removed and substantively identical language on the regulation of CNAs is added under the law governing the New Jersey Board of Nursing or is added to provisions attributing CNA oversight to the board. The board is authorized under the bill to promulgate regulations to effectuate the purposes of the bill. Preceptor Tax Credit Program The bill establishes a gross income tax credit for preceptors of advanced practice nursing, certified nurse midwife, or certified registered nurse anesthetist students.  The tax credit would be equal to $1,000 per student primarily supervised by the preceptor. The preceptor is required to supervise the student for at least 100 clinical hours during the taxable year to be eligible for the credit.  The tax credit program is limited to $10 million annually, and the tax credits awarded under the program are non-refundable and may not be carried forward. As defined in the bill, a preceptor is an individual who is an advanced practice nurse, physician, physician assistant, or psychologist, who meets the qualifications for precepting under the rules and regulations of the New Jersey Board of Nursing, and who participates in the instructional training of advanced practice nursing, certified nurse midwife, or certified registered nurse anesthetist students.

(cf: P.L.2002, c.104, s.5) 19.  (New section) a.  The New Jersey Board of Nursing shall not issue a nurse aide certification to any applicant, except on a conditional basis as provided for in subsection d. of section 20 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the board first determines, consistent with the requirements of sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), that no criminal history record information exists on file in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Identification Division, or in the State Bureau of Identification in the Division of State Police, which would disqualify that person from being certified. In addition, a follow-up criminal history record background check of federal records shall be conducted at least once every two years as a condition of recertification for every certified nurse aide; except that the board, in lieu of conducting follow-up criminal history record background checks for purposes of recertification, may provide for an alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, including, but not limited to, a match of a person's Social Security number or other identifying information with records of criminal proceedings in this and other states.  If the board elects to implement this alternative means of determining whether a certified nurse aide has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense which would disqualify that person from certification, the board shall report to the Governor and the Legislature prior to its implementation on the projected costs and procedures to be followed with respect to its implementation and setting forth the rationale therefor. A person shall be disqualified from certification if that person's criminal history record background check reveals a record of conviction of any of the following crimes and offenses: (1)   In New Jersey, any crime or disorderly persons offense: (a)   involving danger to the person, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:11-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:12-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:13-1 et seq., N.J.S.2C:14-1 et seq. or N.J.S.2C:15-1 et seq.; or (b)   against the family, children, or incompetents, meaning those crimes and disorderly persons offenses set forth in N.J.S.2C:24-1 et seq.; or (c)   involving theft as set forth in chapter 20 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; or (d)   involving any controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog as set forth in chapter 35 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes except paragraph (4) of subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-10. (2)   In any other state or jurisdiction, of conduct which, if committed in New Jersey, would constitute any of the crimes or disorderly persons offenses described in paragraph (1) of this subsection. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, no person shall be disqualified from certification on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check performed pursuant to sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a) if the person has affirmatively demonstrated to the board clear and convincing evidence of the person's rehabilitation.  In determining whether a person has affirmatively demonstrated rehabilitation, the following factors shall be considered: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position which the convicted person would hold, has held or currently holds, as the case may be; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the offense occurred; (4)   the date of the offense; (5)   the age of the person when the offense was committed; (6)   whether the offense was an isolated or repeated incident; (7)   any social conditions which may have contributed to the offense; and (8)   any evidence of rehabilitation, including good conduct in prison or in the community, counseling or psychiatric treatment received, acquisition of additional academic or vocational schooling, successful participation in correctional work-release programs, or the recommendation of those who have had the person under their supervision. c.     If a person subject to the provisions of sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) refuses to consent to, or cooperate in, the securing of a criminal history record background check, the board shall, as applicable: (1)   not issue a nurse aide certification and shall notify the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of section 20 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or the applicant's prospective employer if known, of that denial; or (2)   revoke the person's current nurse aide certification and notify the person, and the person's employer, if known, of that revocation. 20.  (New section)  a.  An applicant for certification, or a certified nurse aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 19 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall submit to the board that individual's name, address, and fingerprints taken on standard fingerprint cards by a State or municipal law enforcement agency.  The board is authorized to exchange fingerprint data with and receive criminal history record information from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Division of State Police for use in making the determinations required by sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    Upon receipt of the criminal history record information for a person from the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Division of State Police, the board shall immediately notify, in writing, the applicant, and the applicant's employer if the applicant is conditionally employed as provided in subsection d. of this section or the applicant's prospective employer if known, or a certified nurse aide who is required to undergo a criminal history record background check pursuant to section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and that person's employer, as applicable, of the person's qualification or disqualification for certification under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). If the person is disqualified, the conviction or convictions which constitute the basis for the disqualification shall be identified in the notice to the person, but shall not be identified in the notice to the person's employer or prospective employer. c.     The person who is the subject of the background check shall have 30 days from the date of the written notice of disqualification to petition the board for a hearing on the accuracy of the person's criminal history record information or to establish the person's rehabilitation under subsection b. of section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The board shall notify the person's employer or prospective employer of the person's petition for a hearing within five days following the receipt of the petition from the person.  Upon the issuance of a final decision upon a petition to the board pursuant to this subsection, the board shall notify the person and the person's employer or prospective employer as to whether the person remains disqualified from certification under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature). d.    An applicant for certification may be issued conditional certification and may be employed as a nurse aide conditionally for a period not to exceed 60 days, pending completion of a criminal history record background check required under sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature) by the Division of State Police in the Department of Law and Public Safety based upon an examination of its own files in accordance with section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), and for an additional period not to exceed 60 days pending completion of a criminal history record background check by federal authorities as arranged for by the Division of State Police pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1997, c.100 (C.53:1-20.9a), if the person submits to the board a sworn statement attesting that the person has not been convicted of any crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  A person who submits a false sworn statement shall be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide, as the case may be, and shall not have an opportunity to establish rehabilitation pursuant to subsection b. of section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). A conditionally employed person, or an employed person certified as a nurse aide, who disputes the accuracy of the criminal history record information and who files a petition requesting a hearing pursuant to subsection c. of this section may remain employed by that person's employer until the board rules on the person's petition but, pending the board's ruling, the employer shall not permit the person to have unsupervised contact with patients, residents, or clients, as the case may be, who are 60 years of age or older. e. (1) A licensed health care facility or other entity that has received an application from or conditionally employs an applicant for nurse aide certification, or employs a certified nurse aide, shall be immune from liability for disclosing that disqualification or termination in good faith to another licensed health care facility or other entity that is qualified by statute or regulation to employ the person as a nurse aide, provided that the licensed health care facility or other entity: (a)   receives notice from the board that the applicant or certified nurse aide, as applicable, has been determined by the board to be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide pursuant to sections 19 through 22 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature); or (b)   terminates its employment of a conditionally employed applicant for nurse aide certification or a certified nurse aide because the person was disqualified from employment at the health care facility or other entity on the basis of a conviction of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) after commencing employment at the health care facility or other entity. (2)   A licensed health care facility or other entity which discloses information pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be presumed to be acting in good faith unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the health care facility or other entity acted with actual malice toward the person who is the subject of the information. f. (1) A licensed health care facility or other entity, upon receiving notice from the board that a person employed by it as a nurse aide, including a conditionally employed person, has been convicted of a crime or disorderly persons offense as described in section 19 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) after commencing employment at the health care facility or other entity, shall: (a)   immediately terminate the person's employment as a nurse aide; and (b)   report information about the termination to the board in a manner prescribed by the board, who shall thereupon deem the person to be disqualified from certification as a nurse aide, subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection.

STATEMENT This bill implements certain measures to support nurses and the nursing workforce, and transfers oversight over certified nurse aides (CNAs) from the Department of Health (DOH) to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, effective on the first day of the 19th month next following the enactment of this bill.  Specifically, the bill establishes requirements for the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) to develop new graduate nursing residency programs; increases State funding for the NJCCN; requires hospitals to establish Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Councils; establishes a Nursing School Expansion Grant Program; requires the New Jersey Nursing Emotional Well-Being Institute (NJ-NEW) to establish a program of services and a peer support helpline to promote the mental health and emotional well-being of nurses and their families; establishes annual survey requirements for nurses, homemaker-home health aides (HHAs) and CNAs, as well as for schools that offer nurse training programs and HHA and CNA training programs; and establishes a gross income tax credit for preceptors of certain nursing students. Graduate Nursing Residency Programs This bill establishes a program through which facilities for acute care, long-term care, public health, ambulatory care, home care and hospice providers, and other qualifying facilities or providers may apply to receive financial, material and technical support from the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) to implement a residency program for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses, or one of these professions. To manage the operations of the program, the bill appropriates $500,000 to NJCCN. The NJCCN is to appoint an advisory committee of stakeholders for consultation to effectuate the purposes of the bill. Among the stakeholders to be appointed are two NJCCN representatives; one representative of the New Jersey Board of Nursing who is either a licensed practical nurse or a registered professional nurse; one licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse representing a unionized facility; representatives of various health care facility and provider associations; and two representatives of different academic nursing programs. The bill grants authority to the NJCCN to adjust membership of the advisory committee upon periodic review of the needs of residency programs for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses. The NJCCN is to consult with the advisory committee to 1) establish and update, as necessary, requirements for a residency program and 2) establish criteria for eligibility of facilities and providers to participate in the program created in accordance with the bill. Requirements for a residency program are to include, at a minimum: 1) a 12-month timeline for a residency; 2) a full-time schedule for residents; 3) support for residents by a preceptor or mentor; and 4) collection of data by the facility or provider to send to the NJCCN regarding the number of individuals who completed a residency program with the facility or provider and remained at the facility or with the provider after residency completion for full-time employment. To participate in the NJCCN program, facilities and providers are to file an application that includes information on           1) the number of spots to be offered in the facility or providers residency program; 2) the type of facility or provider seeking approval; and 3) whether the facility or providers residency program is newly established or being updated. Approval of an application will be made on a first-come, first-serve basis, with priority given to long-term care facilities and home care providers. Upon approval of an application, the New Jersey Board of Nursing will provide funding to the NJCCN to offer the financial, material and technical support to the approved facility or provider, in an amount determined based on various criteria, including, but not limited to, the information submitted in the application on the number of spots in a residency program, the type of facility, and if the residency program is new or being updated. The bill directs that at no time is the New Jersey Board of Nursing to allocate an amount exceeding $4 million annually to the NJCCN for the financial, material and technical support to facilities and providers participating in the program created in the bill. Lastly, a biannual report currently required of the NJCCN to submit to the Governor and Legislature is to now include various data on the residency programs established for licensed practical nurses and registered professional nurses. New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing Funding The bill amends current law to provide that an amount equal to at least $515,000 of the initial and renewal licensing fees charged by the New Jersey Board of Nursing for professional and practical nurses is dedicated to funding, and annually appropriated to, the NJCCN.  Under current law, five percent of the initial and renewal licensing fees charged by the board are dedicated to funding, and annually appropriated to, the NJCCN.  Under this bill, the NJCCN will annually receive five percent, or $515,000, whichever amount is greater. Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Council Program The bill requires the Department of Health to require each hospital in this State, as a condition of licensure, to establish a Nurse Workplace Environment and Staffing Council, either by establishing a new council or assigning the functions of the council to a similar existing entity within the hospital. Each council will serve the purpose of: (1)  providing nurses with representation on matters concerning the establishment of healthy work environments and human resource allocation; (2)  creating a forum of participatory leadership; and (3)  supporting the equal participation of nurses and hospital management in hospital decisions affecting nurses. The bill requires that at least 51 percent of the members of each council will be registered nurses that spend at least 50 percent of work time in direct patient care.  Each council will contain a sufficient amount of members to provide adequate representation of all the nurses working in the hospital.  Each council will have a Chief Nursing Officer and a direct care nurse who will serve as the co-chairs of the council.  The selection of the registered nurses will be according to the collective bargaining agreement, if there is one in effect at the hospital.  If there is no applicable collective bargaining agreement, the members of the council who are registered nurses will be selected by their peers.  The members of the council who are hospital administrative staff will be appointed by each councils Chief Nursing Officer. Participation in the council by a hospital employee will be on scheduled work time and compensated at the appropriate rate of pay. Council members will be relieved of all other work duties during meetings of the council.  Each council member will be required to complete the curriculum provided by the Organization of Nurse Leaders of New Jersey Nursing Workplace Environment Commission program or a similar process defined in a collective bargaining agreement. Each council will develop an annual plan concerning nurse staffing and the creation of a positive work environment for nurses within the hospital.  The plan will be based on the needs of patients and be used as a primary component of the staffing budget.  Each council will provide the annual plan to the Chief Nursing Officer for budget planning. The plan will: (a)  not diminish other standards contained in State or federal law and rules, or the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, if any, between the hospital and a representative of the  nursing staff; and (b)  provide for exemptions for some or all requirements of the plan during a state of emergency, as defined in section 23 of P.L.2011, c.19 (C.5:12-45.3), if the hospital is requested or expected to provide an exceptional level of emergency or other medical services. The Department of Health will be responsible for ensuring that each council is in compliance and will review the plan as necessary. Nursing Education Program Grants The bill establishes the Nursing School Expansion Grant Program, which will be administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.  Under the bill, the program will provide grants to eligible nursing education programs in the State to increase their capacity and improve the supply of the nursing workforce.  The bill also appropriates $25 million from the General Fund to the authority for the bills purposes. Under the bill, an eligible nursing education program may submit an application for grant funding through the program to the Chief Executive Officer.  An application is required to include information and data, in such form and in such manner as is required by the Chief Executive Officer, on: (1)   the enrollment and graduation rates for the three academic years preceding the date of the application; (2) the projected plan to increase enrollment and graduation targets; (3) the demographic profile of current students, faculty, and staff and specific plans to increase the diversity of the nursing workforce; (4) any plans for faculty expansions in order to meet the needs of an increased student body; (5) any partnerships, connections, or pathways between licensed practical nursing programs, diploma or certificate programs, associates degree programs, baccalaureate degree programs, and graduate level programs in nursing and nursing education; (6) student pass rates for examinations administered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing; and (7) such other information as the Chief Executive Officer may require. The bill directs the Chief Executive Officer, in consultation with the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing, to develop criteria for the evaluation of applications for grants. Based upon the criteria developed, and within the limit of available appropriations, the Chief Executive Officer will award grants to eligible nursing education programs in such amounts as the officer determines. The bill directs the authority to issue grants in the amount of $24,500,000 and provides that no more than $500,000 may be expended by the authority for the administrative costs of the program. Nurse Emotional Well-Being and Mental Health Support The bill requires the New Jersey Nursing Emotional Well-Being Institute (NJ-NEW) in the NJCCN to establish a program of services designed to promote the mental health and emotional well-being of nurses, as well as to provide a nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline. Specifically, NJ-NEW will be required to establish a program of services designed to promote the mental health and well-being of nurses licensed in New Jersey and their families and prevent the psychological and physical sequelae of stress.  At a minimum, the program will: (1)   encourage all health care facilities in the State that employ nurses to access the NJ-NEW Schwartz Rounds program; (2)   work to make virtual Schwartz rounds available to all nurses in the State on at least a monthly basis; (3)   coordinate with nursing associations, mental health associations, and community organizations to facilitate a Statewide NJ-NEW well-being hub, which will comprise learning collaboratives that offer strategies to prevent work-related stress from causing physical and emotional symptoms, provide educational resources, and provide consultation services for health care organizations in New Jersey to promote emotional well-being for nurses and their families; (4)   provide stress first aid training or establish partnerships with stress first aid training providers to support health care organizations in promoting emotional well-being and resiliency for nurses and their families; (5)   establish an online repository of Statewide emotional well-being and mental health resources and referrals for nurses and their families; and (6)   establish any other evidence-based initiatives that meet the ongoing emotional well-being and mental health needs of nurses and their families. The bill additionally requires NJ-NEW and the University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, to provide a toll-free nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline, or a similar helpline.  The helpline is to be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and respond to calls from nurses and their family members.  The staff of the helpline will provide counselling and support to callers, seek to identify the nurses and their family members who should be referred for further support and counseling services, and provide informational resources.  The helpline is to partner with the Statewide NJ-NEW well-being hub established under the bill to provide callers with resources and skill sets to prevent situations that cause stress and the psychological and physical sequelae of stress. The operators of the helpline are to be trained by University Behavioral Healthcare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey and, to the greatest extent possible, be current or former nurses who are: (1)   familiar with post-traumatic stress disorder and the emotional and psychological tensions, depressions, and anxieties unique to nurses and their family members; or (2)   trained to provide counseling services involving marriage and family life, substance abuse, personal stress management, and other emotional or psychological disorders or conditions which may be likely to adversely affect the personal and profession-related well-being of nurses and their family members. NJ-NEW and University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, are to provide for the confidentiality of the names of the callers, the information discussed, and any referrals for further peer support or counseling; provided, however, that NJ-NEW and Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, may establish guidelines providing for the tracking of any person who exhibits a severe emotional or psychological disorder or condition which the operator handling the call reasonably believes might result in harm to the nurse, family member, or any other person. University Behavioral HealthCare of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, or another entity, will maintain a list of credentialed resources and behavioral health care providers throughout the State, and provide case management services to ensure that nurses and their family members receive ongoing counseling and a continuum of care in New Jersey.  The continuum of services will be required to utilize applicable State and federal guidelines while providing ongoing peer support. The bill appropriates from the General Fund to NJ-NEW the sum of $1,200,000 for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the bill.  Of this amount, NJ-NEW will be required to use $300,000 to support the nurse-to-nurse peer support helpline.  The bill directs that there be annually appropriated to NJ-NEW from the General Fund such sums as are sufficient to support the operations of NJ-NEW and the initiatives undertaken by NJ-NEW pursuant to the bill. Workforce and Training Program Survey Requirements The bill codifies certain existing surveys for nurses and creates new surveys for homemaker-home health aides (HHAs) and CNAs, as well as for schools that offer nurse training programs and HHA and CNA training programs. Specifically, the survey for nurses, HHAs, and CNAs will solicit information concerning:  1) the persons licensure or certification status; 2) the persons demographic information, including age, race, ethnicity, and gender; 3) the persons educational background; 4) the persons employment status; 5) the persons primary employment setting; 6) the type of position held by the person; and any other information as may be required.  Nurses will additionally be asked whether the nurse is licensed under the multistate Nurse Licensure Compact and whether, during the course of the prior year, the nurse provided professional services in other states under the compact.  The survey is to be completed by the professional in connection with the professionals initial licensure or certification and in connection with the renewal of the professionals license or certification. The survey for schools that offer training programs for nurses will include programs that offer a diploma, an associates degree, a baccalaureate degree, or an advanced degree in nursing, as well as licensed practical nurse training programs. The nurse training program survey and the surveys for HHA and CNA training programs will solicit the following information:  1) the number of applicants rejected by the school or program; 2) the total number of available slots at the school or program; 3) the total number of qualified candidates who applied to the school or program; 4) the total number of current enrollees in the school or program; 5) graduation rates from the school or program; 6) in the case of nursing schools, pass rates for program graduates for the National Council Licensure Examination; 7) demographic information concerning current students and faculty, including data concerning age, race, ethnicity, and gender;  8) faculty vacancy rates; 9) the total number of faculty employed; 10) the educational background of faculty members; and 11)  such other information as may be required.  The survey is to be completed by the school or training program no later than July 1 of each year. The New Jersey Board of Nursing and the DOH will be required to develop and annually review the surveys required under the bill in collaboration with the New Jersey Collaborating Center for Nursing (NJCCN) until oversight of CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing pursuant to the bill on the first day of the 19th month next following the enactment of the bill; thereafter, the New Jersey Board of Nursing will develop and review all the surveys required under the bill. The New Jersey Board of Nursing will ensure compliance with the nurse and HHA survey requirements and, following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH, CNAs and CNA training program survey requirements.  Until oversight of CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the DOH will ensure compliance with CNA and CNA training program survey requirements.  The NJCCN and New Jersey Board of Nursing will ensure compliance with the survey requirements for schools with nurse training programs and HHA training programs and, following transfer of oversight over CNAs from the DOH, CNA training programs.  The New Jersey Board of Nursing and DOH will each be required to take appropriate disciplinary action against entities within their respective jurisdictions that fail to complete the survey.  A survey will not be deemed complete unless all survey questions are answered. The New Jersey Board of Nursing will transmit de-identified nurse and HHA survey data, and following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH, CNA survey data, to the NJCCN, which will analyze the data and produce an annual aggregate report.  The NJCCN will additionally analyze and produce an annual aggregate report of nursing school and HHA training program survey data, as well as CNA training program survey data following transfer of oversight of CNAs from the DOH.  Until oversight of CNAs is transferred to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, the DOH will be required to analyze CNA and CNA training program survey data and produce an annual aggregate report; however, the department will be authorized to contract with the NJCCN to analyze the data and produce the report, the costs of which will be offset by the department furnishing the NJCCN with five percent of CNA licensure fees collected for the current reporting period. The reports of survey data for nurses, HHAs, schools that offer training programs for nurses, and HHA training programs will be made available on the Internet websites of the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the NJCCN.  The CNA and CNA training program reports will be made available on the Internet websites of the DOH and the NJCCN until transfer of oversight over CNAs transfers to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, at which point CNA and CNA training program reports will be made available on the Internet websites of the New Jersey Board of Nursing and the NJCCN. Transferring Oversight of CNAs to New Jersey Board of Nursing This bill modifies current law governing CNAs by transferring the regulation of CNAs from the New Jersey Department of Health to the New Jersey Board of Nursing, which is part of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety. Under the bill, references to CNAs in the law currently governing the profession and references to CNAs in law attributing the oversight of CNAs to the Department of Health are removed and substantively identical language on the regulation of CNAs is added under the law governing the New Jersey Board of Nursing or is added to provisions attributing CNA oversight to the board. The board is authorized under the bill to promulgate regulations to effectuate the purposes of the bill. Preceptor Tax Credit Program The bill establishes a gross income tax credit for preceptors of advanced practice nursing, certified nurse midwife, or certified registered nurse anesthetist students.  The tax credit would be equal to $1,000 per student primarily supervised by the preceptor. The preceptor is required to supervise the student for at least 100 clinical hours during the taxable year to be eligible for the credit.  The tax credit program is limited to $10 million annually, and the tax credits awarded under the program are non-refundable and may not be carried forward. As defined in the bill, a preceptor is an individual who is an advanced practice nurse, physician, physician assistant, or psychologist, who meets the qualifications for precepting under the rules and regulations of the New Jersey Board of Nursing, and who participates in the instructional training of advanced practice nursing, certified nurse midwife, or certified registered nurse anesthetist students.
