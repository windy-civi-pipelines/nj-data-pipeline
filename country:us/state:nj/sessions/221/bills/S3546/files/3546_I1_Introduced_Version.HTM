<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning indirect air pollution from certain
facilities and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) Air pollution
disproportionately impacts overburdened communities, and that without concerted
action, air pollution could worsen in overburdened communities, even as Statewide
emissions decline or stay the same;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Air pollution levels vary
greatly within towns and even neighborhoods, and the variation is missed by
standard monitoring techniques;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Truck traffic contributes
disproportionately to air pollution, so targeting high-traffic locations for
emissions reductions would allow for a greater air pollution mitigation and the
concomitant health benefits at a lower cost than Statewide air pollution
reduction measures;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  Facilities that generate high
truck traffic, such as warehouses, are already having significant impacts in
overburdened communities and those impacts are growing rapidly; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  The federal &quot;Clean
Air Act&quot; expressly reserves existing State authority to regulate mobile
sources that congregate at facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the public interest for the State to implement an
indirect source review program, in order to target and mitigate air pollution
from high-traffic locations in the State, particularly those in overburdened
communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Defeat device&quot;
means any part or component intended for use with, or as part of, any motor
vehicle or motor vehicle engine, where a principal effect of the part or
component is to bypass, defeat, or render inoperative any device or element of
design installed on or in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine in compliance
with State or federal air pollution laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Department&quot; means
the Department of Environmental Protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Federal Reference
Method&quot; means an air pollution monitoring technique that has been tested
and approved as a Federal Reference Method by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Hoteling&quot; means the
practice, by drivers of long-haul trucks, of resting while leaving the truck's
engine running.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Minimum Efficiency
Reporting Value,&quot; or &quot;MERV&quot; means a measurement scale used to
rate the effectiveness of air filters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Operator&quot; means the
person who conducts day-to-day operations at a regulated facility, either with
its employees or through the contracting out of services for all or part of the
regulated facility operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Owner&quot; means a
legal, beneficial, or equitable owner of a regulated facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Overburdened community&quot;
means the same as the term is defined in section 2 of P.L.2020, c.92
(C.13:1D-158).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Regulated facility&quot;
means (1) a facility used for the purpose of goods distribution, whether leased
or used as a proprietary facility, which has 100,000 square feet or more of
business area; (2) a facility located in an overburdened community and used for
the purpose of goods distribution, whether leased or used as a proprietary
facility, which has 50,000 square feet or more of business area; or (3) a
facility that generates 50 or more truck trips per day, including a port or any
part of a port.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Truck count&quot; means
an accounting of the number of trucks traveling through a designated
intersection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Truck trip&quot; means a
one-way trip a truck or tractor makes to or from a facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  No later than 12
months after the effective date of this act, the Department of Environmental
Protection shall establish an indirect source review program for regulated
facilities.  The goal of the program shall be to reduce air pollution emissions
from regulated facilities to zero by 2050.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The owner or operator of
each regulated facility shall obtain, and abide by the terms of, an indirect
source air pollution permit issued by the department pursuant to this act.  A
regulated facility shall not operate without possession of an indirect source
air pollution permit issued by the department.  A newly constructed regulated
facility shall not commence operations without first obtaining an indirect
source air pollution permit.  Any time a regulated facility carries out a major
modification of the facility or its operations, as defined in rules and
regulations adopted by the department pursuant to section 9 of this act, the
owner or operator of the regulated facility shall obtain a new indirect source
air pollution permit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  A permit for a regulated
facility located in an overburdened community shall have a duration of three
years.  A permit for a regulated facility not located in an overburdened
community shall have a duration of five years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  No permit or permit renewal
shall be issued to a regulated facility unless the owner or operator thereof
pays the permit fee required by section 6 of this act, and demonstrates to the
department, in a manner and form determined by the department, the facility's
ability to meet its air pollution mitigation compliance obligations, as
determined by the department pursuant to section 4 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The department shall
consider the following factors or information when issuing and renewing
permits, revoking permits, and imposing permit conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the cumulative impact of
air pollution on residents and workers within a half mile of the regulated
facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) whether the facility is
located with one half-mile of an overburdened community;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) air pollution monitoring
data, including Federal Reference Method, fence-line, and satellite data;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the results of any
inspections of the facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) whether the regulated
facility is in compliance with its air pollution reduction plan compliance
obligation, if applicable; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) the modeled emissions
rates for the facility's activities, integrating inputs such as truck counts
and onsite activities such as idling, as calculated by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The department shall
establish a community-prompted permit review protocol for regulated
facilities.  A municipal government, or other community representative
organization, of an overburdened community may petition the department to
review the permit for a regulated facility.  The department shall initiate a
permit review process if the petitioner presents compelling quantitative or
qualitative evidence that the regulated facility is contributing to the
cumulative air pollution burden of the overburdened community.  After the
review, the department may revoke, or impose additional conditions on the
facility's permit, as it deems appropriate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  The provisions of each
permit issued by the department pursuant to this act shall require the regulated
facility to reduce its air pollution emissions to zero by 2050 through truck
electrification, the use of on-site solar power generation, battery storage,
and managed charging systems, or other means. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  The department may revoke
or revise a regulated facility's permit if it finds that the facility is not in
compliance with the provisions of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  The department may, in its
discretion, require that the provisions of a permit issued to a regulated
facility located in, or within a half-mile of, an overburdened community
include more stringent air pollution mitigation requirements that that of an
equivalent facility not in or near an overburdened community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  A permit issued
pursuant to this act shall require the regulated facility to implement an
annual points compliance obligation of air pollution mitigation measures,
determined by the department using a points-based accounting system.  Points
shall be awarded for measures including, but not limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) purchasing
battery-electric trucks;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) purchasing and using
battery-electric forklifts, yard trucks, or other on-site equipment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) using battery-electric
trucks at the regulated facility or in truck trips to or from the regulated
facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) purchasing and using
electric vehicle charging infrastructure;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) using alternatives to
truck trips to or from the regulated facility, such as the use of light duty
electric vehicles or electric ferries;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) installing on-site solar
power generation, electricity storage, or managed charging systems;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) installing and maintaining
MERV 16 or greater filters systems in schools, daycares, hospitals, community
centers, or residences located within one-half mile of the regulated facility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) eliminate cooking,
heating, hot water, or generator combustion emissions by replacing appliances
and equipment at the regulated facility or at buildings located within one-half
mile of a regulated facility; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9) reduce transport emissions
for regulated facilities and their surrounding areas by implementing and maintaining
bicycle- or electric vehicle-share programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The owner or operator of a
regulated facility shall not sell, or otherwise transfer, an annual mitigation
point to a another regulated facility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  If the owner or operator
of regulated facility operator earns more points than is required for the
annual points compliance obligation in a given reporting period, the remaining
points may be used at the same regulated facility to satisfy a points
compliance obligation in any of the following three years, provided that the
owner or operator demonstrates that any improvements or equipment installations
that were used to earn the points being transferred are still operational at
that regulated facility in the year during which the points are used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  Points earned during the three
years prior to a regulated facilitys first compliance period may be banked and
transferred up to three years after the regulated facility operators first
compliance period, provided that the measures taken to earn the points are
documented in an annual report for the year in which the measure was completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  A regulated facility that regularly
causes truck trips to or from a port or an overburdened community, or that is
located at a port, shall have an annual points compliance obligation that is 25
percent higher than that of an equivalent facility that does not meet these
conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  An owner or operator of a
regulated facility that seeks to earn compliance points by using alternatives
to truck trips pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection a. of this section shall
first consult impacted and displaced workers in selecting an alternative to
truck trips and shall only use an alternative upon agreement with a majority of
the impacted and displaced workers.  If employees in a regulated facility have
an exclusive bargaining unit representative and the bargaining unit or the
terms of the collective bargaining agreement would be impacted by the use of an
alternative, then the operator shall consult with and obtain agreement from the
employees who are impacted, displaced, or both, and the representative, in
writing, before using the alternative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.  a.  The department shall
annually conduct truck counting on a representative sample of roads adjacent to
regulated facilities.  Truck counting shall include the class and age of truck
and be conducted in consultation with appropriate community and environmental
justice organizations, if possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The department shall
annually conduct monitoring of idling and hoteling activities at a
representative sample of regulated facilities.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The department shall
annually conduct an inspection of at least 10 percent of the regulated
facilities located in overburdened communities, and at least five percent of
all other regulated facilities, using a randomized selection process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  In addition to the
inspections required by subsection c. of this section, the department shall
annually inspect each regulated facility in a location within one-half mile of which
500 more children under the age of six reside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The municipal government
of, or a community organization representing, an overburdened community may
petition the department to inspect a regulated facility.  The department shall grant
the petition if the petitioner presents compelling evidence that the regulated
facility is violating the provisions of its permit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  An inspection carried out
pursuant to this section shall include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) fence-line monitoring for
at least one month of each season for one year;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) an analysis of satellite
data;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) monitoring of land use,
on-site combustion, truck counts and ages, idling and hoteling duration, and
other emissions sources;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the identification of
defeat devices;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) a determination of the annual

facility at distances of one-half mile and one mile; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) in the case of an inspection
carried out pursuant to subsection e. of this section, any other metrics
identified by the petitioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.  a.  The department shall establish
and charge the owners or operators of regulated facilities an annual permit
fee.  The department may make the amount of the fee proportional to the
regulated facilitys total emissions of all regulated air contaminants
excluding greenhouse gases.  The overall amount of the annual fee shall be
sufficient to cover the departments costs in implementing the provisions of
this act, including air monitoring activities and truck counting activities. 
For the first annual permit fee only, the department shall require an owner or
operator of the regulated facility to pay an additional amount that is
sufficient, in the departments estimation, to fund the cleanup and restoration
of the regulated facility and its land once the regulated facility is no longer
in commercial operation for longer than one year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The department may
establish a grant program to distribute any excess funds collected under this
section to mitigate health impacts on residents caused by regulated facilities,
reimburse residents for health care expenses caused by regulated facilities, or
to fund community health facilities or initiatives to respond to air pollution
caused by regulated facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.  a.  In addition to any

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would establish a
program in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to require certain
high-traffic facilities to obtain a permit from the DEP and annually implement
measures to reduce air pollution caused by the facility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
apply to regulated facilities, defined by the bill as (1) a facility used for
the purpose of goods distribution, whether leased or used as a proprietary
facility, which has 100,000 square feet or more of business area; (2) a
facility located in an overburdened community and used for the purpose of goods
distribution, whether leased or used as a proprietary facility, which has
50,000 square feet or more of business area; or (3) a facility that generates
50 or more truck trips per day, including a port or any part of a port.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require each
owner or operator of a regulated facility to obtain, and abide by the terms of,
an indirect source air pollution permit issued by the DEP.  A newly constructed
regulated facility would not be allowed to commence operations without first
obtaining an indirect source air pollution permit issued by the DEP.  The goal
of the indirect source air pollution permit program would be to reduce air
pollution from regulated facilities to zero by the year 2050.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each permit would require the
regulated facility to implement an annual quota of air pollution mitigation
measures, determined by the DEP using a points-based accounting system.  Points
would be awarded for measures, as enumerated in subsection a. of section 4 of
the bill, including purchasing battery-electric trucks, purchasing and using
battery-electric forklifts, yard trucks, or other on-site equipment and using
battery-electric trucks at the regulated facility or in truck trips to or from
the regulated facility.  Persons who violate the bill's provisions could be
liable for civil administrative penalties of between $10,000 and $20,000 per
violation, and civil penalties of up to $20,000 per violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to monitor compliance
with the bills provisions, the bill would require the DEP to annually conduct
truck counting on a representative sample of roads adjacent to regulated
facilities, and to annually conduct monitoring of idling and hoteling
activities at a representative sample of regulated facilities.  In addition,
the DEP would be required to annually conduct an inspection of at least 10
percent of the regulated facilities located in overburdened communities, and at
least five percent of all other regulated facilities, using a randomized
selection process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require owners
or operators of regulated facilities to pay an annual permit fee, which would
be set at a level sufficient to cover the DEPs administrative costs in
implementing the bills provisions.  The first annual permit fee paid by a
regulated facility would also include an amount sufficient to fund the cleanup
and restoration of the facility and its land once the facility is no longer in
commercial operation for longer than one year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The DEP would be required to
provide certain public notifications under the permit program, including public
notice of the submission of permit applications, renewals, or revisions, and the
