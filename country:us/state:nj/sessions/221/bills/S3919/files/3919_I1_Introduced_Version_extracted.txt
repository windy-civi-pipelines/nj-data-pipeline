STATEMENT This bill requires each municipality to establish a municipal animal control program that provides animal control services in the municipality, implements the provisions and requirements established in the bill, and enforces State laws, rules, and regulations concerning animal control and animal cruelty.  The bill also establishes additional requirements and components for municipal animal control programs and establishes Department of Health (DOH) oversight over municipal animal control programs.  In addition, the bill: (1) requires each municipality to prioritize funding of its municipal animal control program when allocating municipal funds for the purpose of animal control; (2) establishes a grant program administered by the DOH to assist with funding the requirements established by the bill; and (3) makes an initial appropriation of $500,000 for these grants. The bill requires each municipality to appoint a municipal health officer to oversee the municipal animal control program and coordinate services in the municipality between certified animal control officers, contracted animal control services, shelters, pounds, kennels operating as shelters or pounds, foster homes, animal rescue organizations and their animal rescue organization facilities, and the veterinarians who provide care for animals placed in or impounded in these facilities.  The municipal health officer is required to: (1) advise the governing body of the municipality concerning the implementation of the municipal animal control program and its compliance with State laws and regulations concerning animal control; and (2) provide a quarterly report to the governing body of the municipality and the State Office of Veterinary Public Health in the Department of Health concerning the implementation of the municipal animal control program and its compliance with the applicable State laws and regulations. The bill directs the DOH to consult with the municipal health officers and oversee the enforcement of municipal animal control programs through the municipal health officers.  If a complaint concerning animal control is not addressed satisfactorily by the municipality, a complaint may be filed with the State Office of Veterinary Public Health and addressed through a process developed by that office. The bill establishes requirements concerning the municipal response to reports of an animal outside of the control of an owner, creating a threat to public health or safety, or interfering with the enjoyment of property, and provision for compliance with these requirements in any contract of a private animal control service or a certified animal control officer, as enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of the bill. The bill authorizes the State Office of Veterinary Public Health to intervene in the contracting of a private animal control service or certified animal control officer by a municipality, if the municipal health officer or the municipality do not comply with the contract requirements in the bill.  The bill further authorizes the State Office of Veterinary Public Health to revise as necessary, provisions of the contract concerning impoundment of animals and animal control officer response to reports of an animal outside of the control of an owner, animals creating a threat to public health or safety, or interfering with the enjoyment of property, if the revision is required by a lack of funding which the municipality demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department of Health. In addition, the bill requires each municipal animal control program to include implementation of a homeless cat program through the enactment of an ordinance or resolution.  The homeless cat program may implement any humane method of addressing homeless cats in the municipality, but if the municipality chooses to permit cat colonies in the municipality, the bill establishes additional requirements. If a cat colony is permitted, the municipal ordinance or resolution is required to provide for the assignment of care for the cat colony to vetted individuals or representatives of an animal rescue organization contracted by the municipality, or the certified animal control officer or the private animal control services contracted by the municipality, or a combination thereof.  Furthermore, the ordinance or resolution shall provide for the management of veterinary care for the cat colony, oversight of the administration of veterinary care, and the person assigned care of the cat colony is required to maintain records on its care and report annually to the governing body of the municipality and the State Office of Veterinary Public Health concerning the oversight of the cat colony.  The bill also provides that any cat in the cat colony that is not ear-tipped must be captured, spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, vaccinated, and returned to the cat colony. Finally, the bill authorizes the DOH to adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions and coordinate the implementation of municipal animal control programs to ensure uniform enforcement of animal control and concerns related to animal control throughout the State.

The bill requires each municipality to appoint a municipal health officer to oversee the municipal animal control program and coordinate services in the municipality between certified animal control officers, contracted animal control services, shelters, pounds, kennels operating as shelters or pounds, foster homes, animal rescue organizations and their animal rescue organization facilities, and the veterinarians who provide care for animals placed in or impounded in these facilities.  The municipal health officer is required to: (1) advise the governing body of the municipality concerning the implementation of the municipal animal control program and its compliance with State laws and regulations concerning animal control; and (2) provide a quarterly report to the governing body of the municipality and the State Office of Veterinary Public Health in the Department of Health concerning the implementation of the municipal animal control program and its compliance with the applicable State laws and regulations. The bill directs the DOH to consult with the municipal health officers and oversee the enforcement of municipal animal control programs through the municipal health officers.  If a complaint concerning animal control is not addressed satisfactorily by the municipality, a complaint may be filed with the State Office of Veterinary Public Health and addressed through a process developed by that office. The bill establishes requirements concerning the municipal response to reports of an animal outside of the control of an owner, creating a threat to public health or safety, or interfering with the enjoyment of property, and provision for compliance with these requirements in any contract of a private animal control service or a certified animal control officer, as enumerated in sections 2 and 3 of the bill. The bill authorizes the State Office of Veterinary Public Health to intervene in the contracting of a private animal control service or certified animal control officer by a municipality, if the municipal health officer or the municipality do not comply with the contract requirements in the bill.  The bill further authorizes the State Office of Veterinary Public Health to revise as necessary, provisions of the contract concerning impoundment of animals and animal control officer response to reports of an animal outside of the control of an owner, animals creating a threat to public health or safety, or interfering with the enjoyment of property, if the revision is required by a lack of funding which the municipality demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department of Health. In addition, the bill requires each municipal animal control program to include implementation of a homeless cat program through the enactment of an ordinance or resolution.  The homeless cat program may implement any humane method of addressing homeless cats in the municipality, but if the municipality chooses to permit cat colonies in the municipality, the bill establishes additional requirements. If a cat colony is permitted, the municipal ordinance or resolution is required to provide for the assignment of care for the cat colony to vetted individuals or representatives of an animal rescue organization contracted by the municipality, or the certified animal control officer or the private animal control services contracted by the municipality, or a combination thereof.  Furthermore, the ordinance or resolution shall provide for the management of veterinary care for the cat colony, oversight of the administration of veterinary care, and the person assigned care of the cat colony is required to maintain records on its care and report annually to the governing body of the municipality and the State Office of Veterinary Public Health concerning the oversight of the cat colony.  The bill also provides that any cat in the cat colony that is not ear-tipped must be captured, spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, vaccinated, and returned to the cat colony. Finally, the bill authorizes the DOH to adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the bills provisions and coordinate the implementation of municipal animal control programs to ensure uniform enforcement of animal control and concerns related to animal control throughout the State.
