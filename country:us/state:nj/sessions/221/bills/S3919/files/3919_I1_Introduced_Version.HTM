municipality to establish a municipal animal control program that provides
animal control services in the municipality, implements the provisions and
requirements established in the bill, and enforces State laws, rules, and
regulations concerning animal control and animal cruelty.  The bill also establishes
additional requirements and components for municipal animal control programs
and establishes Department of Health (DOH) oversight over municipal animal
control programs.  In addition, the bill:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) requires each municipality
to prioritize funding of its municipal animal control program when allocating
municipal funds for the purpose of animal control;</p>

control officers, contracted animal control services, shelters, pounds, kennels
operating as shelters or pounds, foster homes, animal rescue organizations and
their animal rescue organization facilities, and the veterinarians who provide

Public Health in the Department of Health concerning the implementation of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the DOH to consult
with the municipal health officers and oversee the enforcement of municipal
animal control programs through the municipal health officers.  If a complaint
concerning animal control is not addressed satisfactorily by the municipality,
a complaint may be filed with the State Office of Veterinary Public Health and addressed
through a process developed by that office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes
requirements concerning the municipal response to reports of an animal outside

reports of an animal outside of the control of an owner, animals creating a
threat to public health or safety, or interfering with the enjoyment of
property, if the revision is required by a lack of funding which the
municipality demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department of Health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill requires
each municipal animal control program to include implementation of a homeless
cat program through the enactment of an ordinance or resolution.  The homeless
cat program may implement any humane method of addressing homeless cats in the
municipality, but if the municipality chooses to permit cat colonies in the
municipality, the bill establishes additional requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If a cat colony is permitted,
the municipal ordinance or resolution is required to provide for the assignment
of care for the cat colony to vetted individuals or representatives of an
animal rescue organization contracted by the municipality, or the certified
animal control officer or the private animal control services contracted by the
municipality, or a combination thereof.  Furthermore, the ordinance or
resolution shall provide for the management of veterinary care for the cat
colony, oversight of the administration of veterinary care, and the person
assigned care of the cat colony is required to maintain records on its care and
report annually to the governing body of the municipality and the State Office
of Veterinary Public Health concerning the oversight of the cat colony.  The
bill also provides that any cat in the cat colony that is not ear-tipped must
be captured, spayed or neutered, ear-tipped, vaccinated, and returned to the
cat colony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill authorizes
the DOH to adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement the bills
provisions and coordinate the implementation of municipal animal control
programs to ensure uniform enforcement of animal control and concerns related
to animal control throughout the State.</p>
