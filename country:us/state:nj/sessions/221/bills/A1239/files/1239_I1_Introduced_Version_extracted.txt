A1239 ASSEMBLY, No. 1239 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ALEX SAUICKIE District 12 (Burlington, Middlesex, Monmouth and Ocean) SYNOPSIS Requires generator, shower facilities, and kitchen in newly-constructed clubhouse in age-restricted housing development. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning emergency facilities in age-restricted developments, and supplementing P.L.1977, c.419 (C.45:22A-21 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  a.  A newly-constructed clubhouse in an age-restricted development shall be equipped with a generator, shower facilities, and a kitchen, to be available for use by the residents of the age-restricted development in the event of an emergency.  The requirements of this section shall not apply to the construction of a new clubhouse in an age-restricted development that already contains a clubhouse equipped with a generator, shower facilities, and a kitchen, available for use by the residents of the age-restricted development in the event of an emergency.  If a site plan or subdivision provides for the construction of more than one clubhouse in an age-restricted development, the requirements of this section shall only apply to one of the clubhouses. b.  As used in this section: "Age-restricted development" means a planned real estate development that complies with the "housing for older persons" exception from the federal "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988," Pub.L.100-430 (42 U.S.C. ss.3601 et seq.) for that community as set forth in section 100.301 of Title 24, Code of Federal Regulations. "Clubhouse" means a meeting space or other indoor area, consisting of a floor area of 1,000 square feet or more, that is intended to function primarily for social activities, and is served by plumbing facilities. "Generator" means an emergency power generator that is integrated with the electrical system of the clubhouse, and capable of powering the intended functions of the clubhouse during an emergency. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require a newly-constructed clubhouse in an age-restricted development to be equipped with an emergency power generator, shower facilities, and a kitchen, to be available for use by the residents in the event of an emergency.  The availability of these basic facilities is vital in the event of an emergency.  Without the availability of the facilities required by this bill, many medically frail seniors would have to be transported during or just after an emergency, a time when emergency personnel may be required to respond to demands for services elsewhere.  The provisions of this bill would enable more senior citizens to shelter in place through an emergency. The bill defines an "age-restricted development" as a planned real estate development that complies with the "housing for older persons" exception from the federal "Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988."  The bill defines a "clubhouse" as a meeting space or other indoor area, consisting of a floor area of 1,000 square feet or more, intended to function primarily for social activities, and that is served by plumbing facilities. The requirements of the bill would not apply to the construction of a new clubhouse in an age-restricted development that already contains a clubhouse equipped with a generator, shower facilities, and a kitchen, available for use by the residents in the event of an emergency.  If a site plan or subdivision provides for the construction of more than one clubhouse in an age-restricted development, then the requirements of the bill would only apply to one of the clubhouses.
