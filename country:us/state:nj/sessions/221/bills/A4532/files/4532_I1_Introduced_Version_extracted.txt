"Structure" means any building, room, ship, vessel, car, vehicle or airplane, [and also means any place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons,] or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present. "Utility Company Property" means property; (1) owned by a public utility, as defined in R.S.48:2-13, or by a municipality, county, water district, authority or other public agency, and (2) which is used for the purpose of providing electric, gas or water utility service. "Operational area" means any portion of a public airport, from which access by the public is prohibited by fences or appropriate signs, and includes runways, taxiways, all ramps, cargo ramps and apron areas, aircraft parking and storage areas, fuel storage areas, maintenance areas, and any other area of a public airport used or intended to be used for landing, takeoff or surface maneuvering of aircraft. "Sterile area" means a portion of an airport, as set forth in an airport security program approved by the Transportation Security Administration, that provides passengers access to boarding aircraft and to which the access generally is controlled by the Transportation Security Administration, an aircraft operator pursuant to 49 C.F.R. part 1544, or an air carrier pursuant to 49 C.F.R. part 1546, through the screening of persons and property. (cf: P.L.2013, c.138, s.1) 2.

Otherwise, burglary is a crime of the third degree.  An act shall be deemed in the course of committing an offense if it occurs in an attempt to commit an offense or in immediate flight after the attempt or commission. 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes burglary of a residence as a separate crime from the crime of burglary pursuant to N.J.S.A.2C:18-2, thus facilitating the tracking of the crime of burglary of residential dwellings in this State. Under the bill, residential dwelling is defined as: (1) any building or structure, though movable or temporary, or a portion thereof, which serves primarily as a residence for one or more persons; or (2) any place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons. The penalties for burglary of a residence remain the same as under current law.  It is a crime of the third degree to commit a burglary of a residential dwelling under this bill; except that it is a crime of the second degree if the actor: (1) purposely, knowingly, or recklessly inflicts, attempts to inflict, or threatens to inflict bodily injury on anyone; (2) is armed with or displays what appear to be explosives or a deadly weapon; or (3) enters the residential dwelling while a resident or any other person, other than a person acting in concert with the actor, is present in the residential dwelling.
