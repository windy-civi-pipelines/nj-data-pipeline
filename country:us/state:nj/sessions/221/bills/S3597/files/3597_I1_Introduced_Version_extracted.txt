[A disclosure under this subsection shall be in bold, capital letters in at least 12-point type.] c.     If an Internet dating service conducts criminal background screenings on all of its communicating members as a condition of membership, then the service shall disclose, clearly and conspicuously, to all New Jersey members that the Internet dating service conducts a criminal background screening on each member prior to permitting a New Jersey member to communicate with another member.  The disclosure shall be provided on the website pages used when a New Jersey member signs up.  A disclosure under this subsection shall be in bold, capital letters in at least 12-point type. d.    If an Internet dating service conducts criminal background screenings, then the service shall [disclose] state: (1) whether it has a policy allowing a member who has been identified as having a criminal conviction to have access to its service to communicate with any New Jersey member; [shall] (2) [state] that criminal background screenings are not foolproof; that they may give members a false sense of security; (3) that [they] criminal background screenings are not a perfect safety solution; (4) that criminals may circumvent even the most sophisticated search technology; (5) that not all criminal records are public in all states and not all databases are up to date; (6) that only publicly available convictions are included in the screening; and (7) that screenings do not cover other types of convictions or arrests or any convictions from foreign countries. e.  An Internet dating service that does not conduct criminal background screenings on all of its members as a condition of membership, shall conduct a screening upon the request of a member who is seeking to obtain the information about another member for the purpose of engaging in dating, relationship, compatibility, matrimonial or social referral provided the member who is requested to undergo the screening gives consent to the screening.

Under the Internet Dating Safety Act, Internet dating services that do not require members to submit to a criminal record screening are required to disclose to all New Jersey members that the Internet dating service does not conduct criminal background screenings.  This bill amends current law to require these Internet dating services to conduct criminal record screening upon the request of a member who is seeking criminal record information about another member provided that member gives consent to the screening.
