(cf: P.L.2011, c.179, s.6) 8.    (New section)  a.     A hospitalized terminally ill person who is unable to appear for the licensure of his marriage or civil union may obtain licensure for that marriage or civil union by: (1)   the appearance of an attorney-in-fact, commissioned and empowered in writing for that purpose through a power of attorney, pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section; or (2)   the appearance of attorneys-in-fact for both parties, commissioned and empowered in writing for that purpose through powers of attorney, pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section; or (3)   by telephonic communication with the licensing officer, pursuant to the provisions of subsection c. of this section. b.   Pursuant to subparagraphs (1) or (2) of subsection a. of this section, the attorney-in-fact must personally appear before the licensing officer with the person who is not terminally ill, and present the original power of attorney duly signed by the terminally ill person and acknowledged by a notary, except that the person who is not terminally ill may be excused from appearing before the licensing officer if that person executes a separate power of attorney, acknowledged by a notary, permitting an attorney-in-fact to appear on his behalf as well.  Each power of attorney shall state the legal names of the parties to be married or enter into a civil union, and shall state that the power of attorney is solely for the purpose of authorizing the attorney-in-fact to obtain a marriage or civil union license on behalf of the terminally ill person and, where a power of attorney has also been executed by the person who is not terminally ill, on behalf of that person. Each power of attorney shall be accompanied by a certification by the terminally ill persons treating physician. Each original power of attorney and accompanying certification shall be a part of the marriage or civil union certificate upon registration. c.     Pursuant to subparagraph (3) of subsection a. of this section,  in lieu of the appearance of an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the hospitalized terminally ill patient or attorneys-in-fact for both parties, the licensing officer shall, before issuing a marriage or civil union license, require the contracting parties to communicate by telephone with him and subscribe and swear to an oath attesting the truth of the facts respecting the legality of the proposed marriage or civil union as set forth in the form supplied by the State registrar.  Said testimony shall be verified by a witness of legal age who is in the presence of the contracting parties.  A licensing officer shall issue a license only if it is thus made to appear before him that no legal impediment to the marriage or civil union exists.  Every licensing officer may administer oaths to the contracting parties. Any identifying witness, applicant applying for a marriage or civil union license or attorney-in-fact who shall knowingly make false answers to any of the inquiries asked by the licensing officer shall be guilty of perjury. As used in P.L.    , c. (C.        )  (pending before the Legislature as this bill), terminally ill means having an illness or injury that can reasonably be expected to result in death in 12 months or less as determined by the treating physician. 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the procedures for obtaining a marriage or civil union license when a party is terminally ill. The bill is designated Linnette Lebrons Law. Currently, persons intending to be married or to enter into a civil union in New Jersey must first obtain a marriage or civil union license from a licensing officer and deliver it to the person who is to officiate.  The statutes provide for a mandatory 72-hour waiting period from the time the application is made until the issuance of the license, unless all or part of that time period has been waived by order of the Superior Court. Under the bill, the 72-hour waiting period may be waived in a case involving a hospitalized terminally ill person whose terminal illness is certified to the licensing officer by the persons treating physician.  The licensing officer would attach the certification from the physician to the license application. The bill also allows the terminally ill person, or both parties, to obtain the marriage or civil union license through a power of attorney instead of appearing in person before the licensing officer.  In addition, the parties could obtain the license by a telephone conference with the licensing officer. Specifically, the bill requires the attorney-in-fact to personally appear before the licensing officer with the person who is not terminally ill, and present the original power of attorney duly signed by the terminally ill person and acknowledged by a notary, except that the person who is not terminally ill may also be excused from appearing before the licensing officer if that person executes a separate power of attorney, acknowledged by a notary, permitting an attorney-in-fact to appear on his behalf as well. Each power of attorney would state the legal names of the parties to be married or enter into a civil union, and state that the power of attorney is solely for the purpose of authorizing the attorney-in-fact to obtain a marriage or civil union license on behalf of the terminally ill person and, where a power of attorney has also been executed by the person who is not terminally ill, on behalf of that person.  Each power of attorney would be accompanied by a certification of the terminally ill persons treating physician.  The power of attorney and accompanying certification would be a part of the marriage or civil union certificate upon registration. The bill also provides that, in lieu of the appearance of an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the hospitalized terminally ill patient or attorneys-in-fact for both parties, the parties could obtain a license by telephone.  In this case the licensing officer would require the contracting parties communicating with him by telephone to subscribe and swear to an oath attesting the truth of the facts respecting the legality of the proposed marriage or civil union.  The parties testimony would be verified by a witness of legal age who is in the presence of the contracting parties. Under current law, any identifying witness, license applicant, or attorney-in-fact who knowingly makes false answers to any of the inquiries asked by the licensing officer is guilty of perjury.  The bill specifies that making knowingly false answers to telephone inquiries asked by the licensing officer would constitute perjury as well. This bill is named after a Camden resident who passed away in February, 2015. While Linnette Lebron was dying in the hospital, her husband-to-be was forced to leave her side to go to court to try to obtain a waiver of the 72-hour waiting period.  They were married in the hospital and she died the next day. The bill defines terminally ill as having an illness or injury that can reasonably be expected to result in death in 12 months or less as determined by the treating physician.

Each original power of attorney and accompanying certification shall be a part of the marriage or civil union certificate upon registration. c.     Pursuant to subparagraph (3) of subsection a. of this section,  in lieu of the appearance of an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the hospitalized terminally ill patient or attorneys-in-fact for both parties, the licensing officer shall, before issuing a marriage or civil union license, require the contracting parties to communicate by telephone with him and subscribe and swear to an oath attesting the truth of the facts respecting the legality of the proposed marriage or civil union as set forth in the form supplied by the State registrar.  Said testimony shall be verified by a witness of legal age who is in the presence of the contracting parties.  A licensing officer shall issue a license only if it is thus made to appear before him that no legal impediment to the marriage or civil union exists.  Every licensing officer may administer oaths to the contracting parties. Any identifying witness, applicant applying for a marriage or civil union license or attorney-in-fact who shall knowingly make false answers to any of the inquiries asked by the licensing officer shall be guilty of perjury. As used in P.L.    , c. (C.        )  (pending before the Legislature as this bill), terminally ill means having an illness or injury that can reasonably be expected to result in death in 12 months or less as determined by the treating physician. 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the procedures for obtaining a marriage or civil union license when a party is terminally ill. The bill is designated Linnette Lebrons Law. Currently, persons intending to be married or to enter into a civil union in New Jersey must first obtain a marriage or civil union license from a licensing officer and deliver it to the person who is to officiate.  The statutes provide for a mandatory 72-hour waiting period from the time the application is made until the issuance of the license, unless all or part of that time period has been waived by order of the Superior Court. Under the bill, the 72-hour waiting period may be waived in a case involving a hospitalized terminally ill person whose terminal illness is certified to the licensing officer by the persons treating physician.  The licensing officer would attach the certification from the physician to the license application. The bill also allows the terminally ill person, or both parties, to obtain the marriage or civil union license through a power of attorney instead of appearing in person before the licensing officer.  In addition, the parties could obtain the license by a telephone conference with the licensing officer. Specifically, the bill requires the attorney-in-fact to personally appear before the licensing officer with the person who is not terminally ill, and present the original power of attorney duly signed by the terminally ill person and acknowledged by a notary, except that the person who is not terminally ill may also be excused from appearing before the licensing officer if that person executes a separate power of attorney, acknowledged by a notary, permitting an attorney-in-fact to appear on his behalf as well. Each power of attorney would state the legal names of the parties to be married or enter into a civil union, and state that the power of attorney is solely for the purpose of authorizing the attorney-in-fact to obtain a marriage or civil union license on behalf of the terminally ill person and, where a power of attorney has also been executed by the person who is not terminally ill, on behalf of that person.  Each power of attorney would be accompanied by a certification of the terminally ill persons treating physician.  The power of attorney and accompanying certification would be a part of the marriage or civil union certificate upon registration. The bill also provides that, in lieu of the appearance of an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the hospitalized terminally ill patient or attorneys-in-fact for both parties, the parties could obtain a license by telephone.  In this case the licensing officer would require the contracting parties communicating with him by telephone to subscribe and swear to an oath attesting the truth of the facts respecting the legality of the proposed marriage or civil union.  The parties testimony would be verified by a witness of legal age who is in the presence of the contracting parties. Under current law, any identifying witness, license applicant, or attorney-in-fact who knowingly makes false answers to any of the inquiries asked by the licensing officer is guilty of perjury.  The bill specifies that making knowingly false answers to telephone inquiries asked by the licensing officer would constitute perjury as well. This bill is named after a Camden resident who passed away in February, 2015. While Linnette Lebron was dying in the hospital, her husband-to-be was forced to leave her side to go to court to try to obtain a waiver of the 72-hour waiting period.  They were married in the hospital and she died the next day. The bill defines terminally ill as having an illness or injury that can reasonably be expected to result in death in 12 months or less as determined by the treating physician.
