<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would modify the
procedures for obtaining a marriage or civil union license when a party is
terminally ill. The bill is designated Linnette Lebrons Law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, persons intending
to be married or to enter into a civil union in New Jersey must first obtain a
marriage or civil union license from a licensing officer and deliver it to the
person who is to officiate.  The statutes provide for a mandatory 72-hour
waiting period from the time the application is made until the issuance of the
license, unless all or part of that time period has been waived by order of the
Superior Court.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the 72-hour
waiting period may be waived in a case involving a hospitalized terminally ill
person whose terminal illness is certified to the licensing officer by the
persons treating physician.  The licensing officer would attach the
certification from the physician to the license application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also allows the
terminally ill person, or both parties, to obtain the marriage or civil union
license through a power of attorney instead of appearing in person before the
licensing officer.  In addition, the parties could obtain the license by a
telephone conference with the licensing officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
requires the attorney-in-fact to personally appear before the licensing officer
with the person who is not terminally ill, and present the original power of attorney
duly signed by the terminally ill person and acknowledged by a notary, except
that the person who is not terminally ill may also be excused from appearing
before the licensing officer if that person executes a separate power of
attorney, acknowledged by a notary, permitting an attorney-in-fact to appear on
his behalf as well.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Each power of attorney would
state the legal names of the parties to be married or enter into a civil union,
and state that the power of attorney is solely for the purpose of authorizing
the attorney-in-fact to obtain a marriage or civil union license on behalf of
the terminally ill person and, where a power of attorney has also been executed
by the person who is not terminally ill, on behalf of that person.  Each power
of attorney would be accompanied by a certification of the terminally ill
persons treating physician.  The power of attorney and accompanying
certification would be a part of the marriage or civil union certificate upon
registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that,
in lieu of the appearance of an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the hospitalized
terminally ill patient or attorneys-in-fact for both parties, the parties could
obtain a license by telephone.  In this case the licensing officer would
require the contracting parties communicating with him by telephone to
subscribe and swear to an oath attesting the truth of the facts respecting the
legality of the proposed marriage or civil union.  The parties testimony would
be verified by a witness of legal age who is in the presence of the contracting
parties.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, any
identifying witness, license applicant, or attorney-in-fact who knowingly makes
false answers to any of the inquiries asked by the licensing officer is guilty
of perjury.  The bill specifies that making knowingly false answers to
telephone inquiries asked by the licensing officer would constitute perjury as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is named after a
Camden resident who passed away in February, 2015. While Linnette Lebron was
dying in the hospital, her husband-to-be was forced to leave her side to go to
court to try to obtain a waiver of the 72-hour waiting period.  They were
married in the hospital and she died the next day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines terminally
ill as having an illness or injury that can reasonably be expected to result
in death in 12 months or less as determined by the treating physician.</p>
