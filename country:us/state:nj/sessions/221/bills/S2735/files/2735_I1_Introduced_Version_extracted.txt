This includes physical and laboratory examinations for diagnostic purposes, including, but not limited to, phlebotomy, clinical laboratory tests, speculum examinations, orificial examinations, and physiological function tests.  A naturopathic doctor may also order diagnostic imaging studies consistent with naturopathic training, as determined by the board, but is to refer the studies to an appropriately licensed health care professional to conduct the study and interpret the results.

STATEMENT This bill provides for the licensure of naturopathic doctors and establishes the State Board of Naturopathic Examiners in the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety.  As defined in the bill, "naturopathic medicine" means a distinct and comprehensive system of primary health practiced by a naturopathic doctor for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human health conditions, injuries, and disease.  The board would consist of nine members who are residents of the State, six of whom would be, except for the members first appointed, licensed naturopathic doctors who have been actively engaged in the practice of naturopathic medicine for at least five years immediately preceding their appointment; two of whom would be public members; and one of whom would be a State executive department member. Under the bill, the board is authorized to, among other items, (1) establish criteria and standards for licensure; (2) review the qualification of applicants for licensure; (3) adopt rules and regulations to enforce the provisions of the bill; and (4) establish standards for continuing education.  The bill stipulates that a person can practice or hold themselves out to the public as able to practice naturopathic medicine only if the person possesses a valid license.  The license is to be renewed every two years. The bill delineates the scope of services of a naturopathic doctor. This includes physical and laboratory examinations for diagnostic purposes, including, but not limited to, phlebotomy, clinical laboratory tests, speculum examinations, orificial examinations, and physiological function tests.  A naturopathic doctor may also order diagnostic imaging studies consistent with naturopathic training, as determined by the board, but is to refer the studies to an appropriately licensed health care professional to conduct the study and interpret the results. Lastly, the bill establishes a naturopathic childbirth attendance advisory committee to issue recommendations concerning the medical education and training for the specialty practice of naturopathic childbirth attendance.  A naturopathic doctor may not practice naturopathic childbirth attendance without first obtaining a certificate of special competency in naturopathic childbirth attendance.
