A4964 ASSEMBLY, No. 4964 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 17, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  GABRIEL RODRIGUEZ District 33 (Hudson) Assemblyman  WILLIAM F. MOEN, JR. District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Concerns eviction and homelessness prevention; requires new charge for filing of eviction action. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning eviction filing fees, including permitting use of certain fee revenues for homelessness prevention, supplementing chapter 27D of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.2014, c.31. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  Research indicates that the expense of filing an eviction action has a substantial impact on the likelihood of a landlord to make this filing and initiate the process of forcing a tenant out of their home; b.  When eviction filing fees are low, a landlord is able to, in effect, use the court to help in the collection of rent, as the threat of being removed from a home is an effective means of compelling a tenant to pay; c.  Low eviction filing fees disincentivize landlords from communicating with tenants over rent payments that have passed their due dates, to consider possible payment plans and alternatives to eviction; d.  Even when an eviction filing does not result in the actual removal of the tenant, the record of the filing may nonetheless be attached to the tenant, making it more difficult for the tenant to obtain housing in future years; e.  The average eviction filing fee in the United States is $109, substantially higher than the filing fee of $50 required by courts in New Jersey; and f.  Therefore, it is in the public interest to establish a new charge for the filing of an eviction action, and to apply the monies received through this charge for the purposes of eviction and homelessness prevention services. 2.  (New section)  As used in P.L. , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): "Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Community Affairs.
