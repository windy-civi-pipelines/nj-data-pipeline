SCHEPISI District 39 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Revises factors for determining employment or independent contractor status under certain State labor laws. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning employment status and amending R.S.43:21-19. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a)   (1)  "Annual payroll" means the total amount of wages paid during a calendar year (regardless of when earned) by an employer for employment. (2)   "Average annual payroll" means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no "annual payroll" because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the "average annual payroll" in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an "annual payroll" in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his "average annual payroll" determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that "average annual payroll" solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employer's contribution rate is computed. (b)   "Benefits" means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to his unemployment. (c)   (1)  "Base year" with respect to benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding an individual's benefit year. With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1995, if an individual does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in his base year to qualify for benefits, the individual shall have the option of designating that his base year shall be the "alternative base year," which means the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's benefit year; except that, with respect to a benefit year commencing on or after October 1, 1995, if the individual also does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year to qualify for benefits, "alternative base year" means the last three completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year and, of the calendar quarter in which the benefit year commences, the portion of the quarter which occurs before the commencing of the benefit year. The division shall inform the individual of his options under this section as amended by P.L.1995, c.234.  If information regarding weeks and wages for the calendar quarter or quarters immediately preceding the benefit year is not available to the division from the regular quarterly reports of wage information and the division is not able to obtain the information using other means pursuant to State or federal law, the division may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the affidavit of an individual with respect to weeks and wages for that calendar quarter.  The individual shall furnish payroll documentation, if available, in support of the affidavit.  A determination of benefits based on an alternative base year shall be adjusted when the quarterly report of wage information from the employer is received if that information causes a change in the determination. (2)   With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), "base year" shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's period of disability, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period. For the purposes of this paragraph, "period of disability" means the period defined as a period of disability by section 3 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27).  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (2) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (3)   With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the workers' compensation law (chapter 15 of Title 34 of the Revised Statutes), "base year" shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "period of disability" means the period from the time at which the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to resume work and continue work on a permanent basis.  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (3) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (d)   "Benefit year" with respect to any individual means the 364 consecutive calendar days beginning with the day on, or as of, which he first files a valid claim for benefits, and thereafter beginning with the day on, or as of, which the individual next files a valid claim for benefits after the termination of his last preceding benefit year.  Any claim for benefits made in accordance with subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-6 shall be deemed to be a "valid claim" for the purpose of this subsection if (1) he is unemployed for the week in which, or as of which, he files a claim for benefits; and (2) he has fulfilled the conditions imposed by subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-4. (e)   (1) "Division" means the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and any transaction or exercise of authority by the director of the division thereunder, or under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), shall be deemed to be performed by the division.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.230) 2.    This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises the factors that are used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor under certain State labor laws. The ABC test is widely used under current State labor law for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.  It is used to determine employee and employer obligations and entitlements under the following laws: the unemployment compensation law, the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, the New Jersey wage payment law, and the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law.  It is also used under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, for purposes of determining whether an employer is required to deduct and withhold State income taxes. The ABC test provides that an individual who performs services for remuneration is presumed to be an employee unless the employer can show to the satisfaction of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development that: (A) Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such service, both under his contract of service and in fact; and (B) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed; and (C) Such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. If an employer fails to prove any one of the three criteria for showing a worker is an independent contractor, the worker will be classified as an employee, and will be eligible for benefits pursuant to the labor laws listed above. Additionally, the employer and employee will be required to comply with the contribution and participation obligations of the respective labor laws. This bill revises the factors for showing a worker is an independent contract.  Under the bill, to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and the degree of independence is to be considered.  Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories: (A)  behavioral control; (B)  financial control; and (C)  the type of relationship of the parties. In making an employment determination any guidance on determining a workers employment status provided by the federal Internal Revenue Service in the United States Department of the Treasury is to be considered.  This bill aligns the test for employment status under State law with the test in use by the Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury.

S1338 SENATE, No. 1338 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  MICHAEL L. TESTA, JR. District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) Senator  HOLLY T. SCHEPISI District 39 (Bergen) SYNOPSIS Revises factors for determining employment or independent contractor status under certain State labor laws. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning employment status and amending R.S.43:21-19. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a)   (1)  "Annual payroll" means the total amount of wages paid during a calendar year (regardless of when earned) by an employer for employment. (2)   "Average annual payroll" means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher, except that any year or years throughout which an employer has had no "annual payroll" because of military service shall be deleted from the reckoning; the "average annual payroll" in such case is to be determined on the basis of the prior three or five calendar years in each of which the employer had an "annual payroll" in the operation of his business, if the employer resumes his business within 12 months after separation, discharge or release from such service, under conditions other than dishonorable, and makes application to have his "average annual payroll" determined on the basis of such deletion within 12 months after he resumes his business; provided, however, that "average annual payroll" solely for the purposes of paragraph (3) of subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-7 means the average of the annual payrolls of any employer on which he paid contributions to the State disability benefits fund for the last three or five preceding calendar years, whichever average is higher; provided further that only those wages be included on which employer contributions have been paid on or before January 31 (or the next succeeding day if such January 31 is a Saturday or Sunday) immediately preceding the beginning of the 12-month period for which the employer's contribution rate is computed. (b)   "Benefits" means the money payments payable to an individual, as provided in this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), with respect to his unemployment. (c)   (1)  "Base year" with respect to benefit years commencing on or after July 1, 1986, shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding an individual's benefit year. With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after July 1, 1995, if an individual does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in his base year to qualify for benefits, the individual shall have the option of designating that his base year shall be the "alternative base year," which means the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's benefit year; except that, with respect to a benefit year commencing on or after October 1, 1995, if the individual also does not have sufficient qualifying weeks or wages in the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year to qualify for benefits, "alternative base year" means the last three completed calendar quarters immediately preceding his benefit year and, of the calendar quarter in which the benefit year commences, the portion of the quarter which occurs before the commencing of the benefit year. The division shall inform the individual of his options under this section as amended by P.L.1995, c.234.  If information regarding weeks and wages for the calendar quarter or quarters immediately preceding the benefit year is not available to the division from the regular quarterly reports of wage information and the division is not able to obtain the information using other means pursuant to State or federal law, the division may base the determination of eligibility for benefits on the affidavit of an individual with respect to weeks and wages for that calendar quarter.  The individual shall furnish payroll documentation, if available, in support of the affidavit.  A determination of benefits based on an alternative base year shall be adjusted when the quarterly report of wage information from the employer is received if that information causes a change in the determination. (2)   With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-25 et seq.), "base year" shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's period of disability, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period. For the purposes of this paragraph, "period of disability" means the period defined as a period of disability by section 3 of the "Temporary Disability Benefits Law," P.L.1948, c.110 (C.43:21-27).  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (2) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (3)   With respect to a benefit year commencing on or after June 1, 1990 for an individual who immediately preceding the benefit year was subject to a disability compensable under the provisions of the workers' compensation law (chapter 15 of Title 34 of the Revised Statutes), "base year" shall mean the first four of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the individual's period of disability, if the period of disability was not longer than two years, if the employment held by the individual immediately preceding the period of disability is no longer available at the conclusion of that period and if the individual files a valid claim for unemployment benefits after the conclusion of that period.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "period of disability" means the period from the time at which the individual becomes unable to work because of the compensable disability until the time that the individual becomes able to resume work and continue work on a permanent basis.  An individual who files a claim under the provisions of this paragraph (3) shall not be regarded as having left work voluntarily for the purposes of subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-5. (d)   "Benefit year" with respect to any individual means the 364 consecutive calendar days beginning with the day on, or as of, which he first files a valid claim for benefits, and thereafter beginning with the day on, or as of, which the individual next files a valid claim for benefits after the termination of his last preceding benefit year.  Any claim for benefits made in accordance with subsection (a) of R.S.43:21-6 shall be deemed to be a "valid claim" for the purpose of this subsection if (1) he is unemployed for the week in which, or as of which, he files a claim for benefits; and (2) he has fulfilled the conditions imposed by subsection (e) of R.S.43:21-4. (e)   (1) "Division" means the Division of Unemployment and Temporary Disability Insurance of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and any transaction or exercise of authority by the director of the division thereunder, or under this chapter (R.S.43:21-1 et seq.), shall be deemed to be performed by the division.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.230) 2.    This act shall take effect on the 90th day next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises the factors that are used to determine whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor under certain State labor laws. The ABC test is widely used under current State labor law for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.  It is used to determine employee and employer obligations and entitlements under the following laws: the unemployment compensation law, the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, the New Jersey wage payment law, and the New Jersey State Wage and Hour Law.  It is also used under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, for purposes of determining whether an employer is required to deduct and withhold State income taxes. The ABC test provides that an individual who performs services for remuneration is presumed to be an employee unless the employer can show to the satisfaction of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development that: (A) Such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such service, both under his contract of service and in fact; and (B) Such service is either outside the usual course of the business for which such service is performed, or that such service is performed outside of all the places of business of the enterprise for which such service is performed; and (C) Such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. If an employer fails to prove any one of the three criteria for showing a worker is an independent contractor, the worker will be classified as an employee, and will be eligible for benefits pursuant to the labor laws listed above. Additionally, the employer and employee will be required to comply with the contribution and participation obligations of the respective labor laws. This bill revises the factors for showing a worker is an independent contract.  Under the bill, to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor, all information that provides evidence of the degree of control and the degree of independence is to be considered.  Facts that provide evidence of the degree of control and independence fall into three categories: (A)  behavioral control; (B)  financial control; and (C)  the type of relationship of the parties. In making an employment determination any guidance on determining a workers employment status provided by the federal Internal Revenue Service in the United States Department of the Treasury is to be considered.  This bill aligns the test for employment status under State law with the test in use by the Internal Revenue Service in the Department of the Treasury.
