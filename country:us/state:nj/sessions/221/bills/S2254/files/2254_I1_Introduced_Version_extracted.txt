All motor vehicle liability policies [, except basic automobile insurance policies,] shall also include coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run motor vehicles, because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of such insured, with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any one accident of $5,000.00, and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damages. b.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided [as an option by an insurer] to the named insured [electing a standard automobile insurance policy up to at least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or $500,000.00 single limit] in amounts or limits equal to the insured's motor vehicle liability coverage, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damage to property for each accident[, except that the limits for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively]. Rates for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be uniform on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory. c.     Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits. d.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of coverage, subrogation and arbitration. e.     For the purpose of this section, (1) "underinsured motorist coverage" means insurance for damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle. [Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured motor vehicle.]  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage available to an injured person shall be reduced by the amount he has recovered under all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds; (2)   "uninsured motor vehicle" means: (a)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident; (b)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer denies coverage or is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured because the insurer has become insolvent or bankrupt, or the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has undertaken control of the insurer for the purpose of liquidation; (c)   a hit and run motor vehicle as described in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78); or (d)   an automobile covered by a special automobile insurance policy pursuant to section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3). "Uninsured motor vehicle" shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. (cf: P.L.2007, c.163, s.1) 3.    Section 18 of P.L.1985, c.520 (C.17:28-1.4) is amended to read as follows: 18.  Any insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, or controlling or controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting insurance business in this State, which sells a policy providing automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, or any similar coverage, in any other state or in any province of Canada, shall include in each policy coverage to satisfy at least the [personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or section 19 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.17:28-1.3) for any New Jersey resident who is not required to maintain personal injury protection coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1) and who is not otherwise eligible for such benefits, whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State. In addition, any insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, or controlling or controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, which sells a policy providing automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, or any similar coverage, in any other state or in any province of Canada, shall include in each policy coverage to satisfy at least the] liability insurance requirements of [subsection a. of] section 1 of P.L.1972, c.197 (C.39:6B-1) [or section 3 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3), the uninsured motorist insurance requirements of subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1), and personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or of section 19 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.17:28-1.3),] whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State. Any liability insurance policy subject to this section shall be construed as providing the coverage required herein[, and any named insured, and any immediate family member as defined in section 14.1 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.39:6A-8.1), under that policy, shall be subject to the tort option specified in subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-8)]. Each insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State and subject to the provisions of this section shall file and maintain with the Department of Banking and Insurance written certification of compliance with the provisions of this section. "Automobile" means [an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2)] a private passenger automobile of a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned or hired and is neither used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a driver; and a motor vehicle with a pickup body, a delivery sedan, a van, or a panel truck or a camper type vehicle used for recreational purposes owned by an individual or by husband and wife who are residents of the same household, not customarily used in the occupation, profession or business of the insured other than farming or ranching.  An automobile owned by a farm family copartnership or corporation, which is principally garaged on a farm or ranch and otherwise meets the definitions contained in this section, shall be considered a private passenger automobile owned by two or more relatives resident in the same household. (cf: P.L.1998, c.21, s.72) 4.    Section 12 of P.L.1974, c.17 (C.17:30A-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  Any person having a covered claim which may be recovered from more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall be required to exhaust first his rights under the statute governing the association of the place of residence of the insured at the time of the insured event except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property.  If recovery is denied or deferred by that association, a person may proceed to seek recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent from which recovery may be legally sought. b.    Any person having a claim[, except for a claim for coverage for personal injury protection benefits issued pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1)], under an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, shall be required to exhaust first his right under that other policy. For purposes of this subsection b., a claim under an insurance policy shall include a claim under any kind of insurance, whether it is a first-party or third-party claim, and shall include without limitation, general liability, accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, health benefits plan coverage, primary and excess coverage, if applicable, and all other private, group or governmental coverages [except coverage for personal injury protection benefits issued pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1)].

Additionally, the bill repeals the mandatory arbitration of certain automobile insurance claims in the courts, the take-all-comers law which requires insurers to insure all "good" drivers who apply, and the basic and special automobile insurance policies. Technical amendments to various statutory provisions to conform with these substantive reforms are accomplished by the bill, as well.

All motor vehicle liability policies [, except basic automobile insurance policies,] shall also include coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run motor vehicles, because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of such insured, with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any one accident of $5,000.00, and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damages. b.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided [as an option by an insurer] to the named insured [electing a standard automobile insurance policy up to at least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or $500,000.00 single limit] in amounts or limits equal to the insured's motor vehicle liability coverage, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damage to property for each accident[, except that the limits for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively]. Rates for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be uniform on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory. c.     Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits. d.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of coverage, subrogation and arbitration. e.     For the purpose of this section, (1) "underinsured motorist coverage" means insurance for damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle. [Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured motor vehicle.]  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage available to an injured person shall be reduced by the amount he has recovered under all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds; (2)   "uninsured motor vehicle" means: (a)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident; (b)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer denies coverage or is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured because the insurer has become insolvent or bankrupt, or the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has undertaken control of the insurer for the purpose of liquidation; (c)   a hit and run motor vehicle as described in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78); or (d)   an automobile covered by a special automobile insurance policy pursuant to section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3). "Uninsured motor vehicle" shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. (cf: P.L.2007, c.163, s.1) 3.    Section 18 of P.L.1985, c.520 (C.17:28-1.4) is amended to read as follows: 18.  Any insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, or controlling or controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting insurance business in this State, which sells a policy providing automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, or any similar coverage, in any other state or in any province of Canada, shall include in each policy coverage to satisfy at least the [personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or section 19 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.17:28-1.3) for any New Jersey resident who is not required to maintain personal injury protection coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1) and who is not otherwise eligible for such benefits, whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State. In addition, any insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, or controlling or controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, which sells a policy providing automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, or any similar coverage, in any other state or in any province of Canada, shall include in each policy coverage to satisfy at least the] liability insurance requirements of [subsection a. of] section 1 of P.L.1972, c.197 (C.39:6B-1) [or section 3 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3), the uninsured motorist insurance requirements of subsection a. of section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1), and personal injury protection benefits coverage pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) or of section 19 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.17:28-1.3),] whenever the automobile or motor vehicle insured under the policy is used or operated in this State. Any liability insurance policy subject to this section shall be construed as providing the coverage required herein[, and any named insured, and any immediate family member as defined in section 14.1 of P.L.1983, c.362 (C.39:6A-8.1), under that policy, shall be subject to the tort option specified in subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-8)]. Each insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State and subject to the provisions of this section shall file and maintain with the Department of Banking and Insurance written certification of compliance with the provisions of this section. "Automobile" means [an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2)] a private passenger automobile of a private passenger or station wagon type that is owned or hired and is neither used as a public or livery conveyance for passengers nor rented to others with a driver; and a motor vehicle with a pickup body, a delivery sedan, a van, or a panel truck or a camper type vehicle used for recreational purposes owned by an individual or by husband and wife who are residents of the same household, not customarily used in the occupation, profession or business of the insured other than farming or ranching.  An automobile owned by a farm family copartnership or corporation, which is principally garaged on a farm or ranch and otherwise meets the definitions contained in this section, shall be considered a private passenger automobile owned by two or more relatives resident in the same household. (cf: P.L.1998, c.21, s.72) 4.    Section 12 of P.L.1974, c.17 (C.17:30A-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  Any person having a covered claim which may be recovered from more than one insurance guaranty association or its equivalent shall be required to exhaust first his rights under the statute governing the association of the place of residence of the insured at the time of the insured event except that if it is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, he shall seek recovery first from the association of the location of the property.  If recovery is denied or deferred by that association, a person may proceed to seek recovery from any other insurance guaranty association or its equivalent from which recovery may be legally sought. b.    Any person having a claim[, except for a claim for coverage for personal injury protection benefits issued pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1)], under an insurance policy other than a policy of an insolvent insurer, shall be required to exhaust first his right under that other policy. For purposes of this subsection b., a claim under an insurance policy shall include a claim under any kind of insurance, whether it is a first-party or third-party claim, and shall include without limitation, general liability, accident and health insurance, workers' compensation, health benefits plan coverage, primary and excess coverage, if applicable, and all other private, group or governmental coverages [except coverage for personal injury protection benefits issued pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4) and section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1)].

The [Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles] Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission shall promulgate such rules as may be necessary to set forth those instances where deposit of security is necessary. (b)   The [director] chief administrator may, within 90 days after the receipt of such report of a motor vehicle accident, suspend the license of each operator and all registrations of each owner of a motor vehicle in any manner involved in such accident, and if such operator is a nonresident the privilege of operating a motor vehicle within this State, and if such owner is a nonresident the privilege of the use within this State of any motor vehicle owned by him, unless such operator or owner or both shall deposit security in the sum so determined by the [director] chief administrator; provided, notice of such suspension shall be sent by the [director] chief administrator to such operator and owner not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of such suspension and shall state the amount required as security.  Where erroneous information is given the director with respect to the matters set forth in paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of subsection (c) of this section, he may take appropriate action as hereinbefore provided, within 90 days after receipt by him of correct information with respect to said matters. (c)   This section shall not apply under the conditions stated in section 4 of this act nor: (1)   To such operator or owner, if such owner had in effect, at the time of such accident, a motor vehicle liability policy with respect to the motor vehicle involved in such accident; (2)   To such operator, if not the owner of such motor vehicle, if there was in effect at the time of such accident a motor vehicle liability policy or bond with respect to his operation of motor vehicles not owned by him; (3)   To such operator or owner if the liability of such operator or owner for damages resulting from such accident is, in the judgment of the [director] chief administrator, covered by any other form of liability insurance policy or bond; [nor] or (4)   To any person qualifying as a self-insurer under section 30 of this act, or to any person operating a motor vehicle for such self-insurer.
