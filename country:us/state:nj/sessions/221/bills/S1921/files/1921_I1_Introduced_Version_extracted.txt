Accrued payments to the date of certification shall be paid in one lump sum. Payments pursuant to this section shall be due and payable to an eligible surviving spouse from (1) April 9, 1985 in the event the veteran's death occurred prior to that date, or (2) the date of the veteran's death if the death occurred on or after April 9, 1985, regardless of the date of the surviving spouse's application.  Accrued payments to the date of certification shall be paid in one lump sum.  The Division of Veterans Programs in the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs shall notify all surviving spouses who are certified and receiving annual compensation pursuant to this section on the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), of the provisions of this act, and shall ensure that the accrued payments are paid in one lump sum within 90 days of the effective date. Nothing in P.L.1947, c.263 (C.38:18A-1 et seq.) shall be intended to include paraplegia or hemiplegia resulting from locomotor ataxia or other forms of syphilis of the central nervous system or from chronic alcohol use disorder, or to include other forms of disease resulting from the veteran's own misconduct which may produce signs and symptoms similar to those resulting from paraplegia, osteochondritis, hemiplegia, or multiple sclerosis. (cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.146) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be applicable to surviving spouses receiving payments pursuant to R.S.38:18-1 et seq. and P.L.1947, c.263 (C.38:18A-1 et seq.) on the effective date and thereafter. STATEMENT This bill requires the payment of the $750 annual compensation payable to a surviving spouse of a blind or severely disabled wartime veteran to begin from April 9, 1985 for veterans who died before that date and from the date of the veteran's death, regardless of when the surviving spouse files the application for this benefit, for veterans who died on or after that date. Surviving spouses were first made eligible for this benefit on April 9, 1985 by P.L.1985, c.116. Under current regulations of the Department of Military and Veterans' Affairs, a surviving spouse is eligible for this benefit from the date of application. This lifetime benefit is statutorily available to a veteran who was blinded in service during any war including specifically World War II and the Korean Conflict, or who was severely disabled as a result of service during any war including specifically World War II, the Korean conflict, or Vietnam, although the department has made this benefit available to veterans who served in other wars or military emergencies. A veteran who applied for this benefit within one year of military discharge received payments beginning with that year. A veteran who applied after one year received payments from the date of application. The sponsor states that this same requirement that payments begin from the date of application should not apply to surviving spouses because at the time of the veteran's death it is known that he or she was blind or severely disabled as a result of wartime service.
