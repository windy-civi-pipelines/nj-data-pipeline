The bill provides that State or other public funds may not be used by the MVC for the initial cost to implement the license plate program.  The bill requires the USCG, or an individual or entity designated by the USCG, to contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for any computer programming necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes the USCG to receive funds from private sources to be used to offset the initial costs. The MVC is prohibited from designing, producing, issuing, or publicizing the availability of the license plates, or making any necessary programming changes, until: (1) the USCG, or an individual or entity designated by the USCG, has provided the MVC with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the MVC in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the USCG, or its designee, has provided the MVC with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates, upon the availability for purchase of those license plates.
