(3) If a hospital requests a hearing, the hospital shall pay the amount in full within 60 calendar days after the date of a final and binding decision to uphold, in whole or in part, the civil monetary penalty. (4) If the 60th calendar day is a weekend or a federal or State holiday, then the timeframe shall be extended until the end of the next business day. d.

If a hospital does not request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the issuance of a notice of imposition of a civil monetary penalty, the department may impose the civil monetary penalty indicated in such notice and may impose additional penalties pursuant to continuing violations without the right of appeal.  If the 30th calendar day is a weekend or a federal or State holiday, then the timeframe shall be extended until the end of the next business day. b.

(h) A statement that the hospital's failure to request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the issuance of the notice permits the imposition of the penalty, and any subsequent penalties pursuant to continuing violations, without the right of appeal.  If the civil monetary penalty is upheld, in part, by a final and binding decision, the department shall issue a modified notice of imposition of a civil monetary penalty to conform to the adjudicated finding. c. (1)  The department shall determine the daily dollar amount for a civil monetary penalty for which a hospital may be subject as follows: (a) for each day a hospital is determined by the department to be out of compliance: (i) For a hospital with a number of beds equal to or less than 30, the maximum daily dollar civil monetary penalty amount to which it may be subject shall be $300, even if the hospital is in violation of multiple discrete requirements 1[of this act]1 . (ii) For a hospital with at least 31 and up to and including 550 beds, the maximum daily dollar civil monetary penalty amount to which it may be subject shall be the number of beds times $10, even if the hospital is in violation of multiple discrete requirements 1[of this act]1. (iii) For a hospital with a number of beds greater than 550, the maximum daily dollar civil monetary penalty amount to which it may be subject shall be $5,500, even if the hospital is in violation of multiple discrete requirements 1[of this act]1 .

(v) If the number of beds for the hospital cannot be determined, the department shall request that the hospital provide documentation of its number of beds, in a form and manner and by the deadline prescribed by the department in a written notice provided to the hospital.  If the hospital fails to provide the department with this documentation in the prescribed form and manner, and by the specified deadline, the department shall impose on the hospital the maximum daily dollar civil monetary penalty amount permissible under this section.

(3) If a hospital requests a hearing, the hospital shall pay the amount in full within 60 calendar days after the date of a final and binding decision to uphold, in whole or in part, the civil monetary penalty. (4) If the 60th calendar day is a weekend or a federal or State holiday, then the timeframe shall be extended until the end of the next business day. d. (1)  The department shall post the notice of imposition of a civil monetary penalty on the departments Internet website.
