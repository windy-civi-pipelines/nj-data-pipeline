supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    There is established the
Office of the Child Advocate in the Executive Branch of the State Government. 
For purposes of complying with Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New
Jersey Constitution, the office is allocated within the Department of Children
and Families, but notwithstanding the allocation, the office shall be
independent of any supervision or control by the department, or a division,
office, or officer thereof, in the performance of its duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.     The administrator
and chief executive officer of the office shall be the Child Advocate, who
shall be an attorney admitted to practice law in New Jersey and be qualified by
training and experience to perform the duties of the office.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Child Advocate shall
be appointed by the Governor and shall serve for a term of five years and until
the appointment and qualification of his successor.  The Governor shall have
the power to remove the Child Advocate for cause.  The entire professional time
of the Child Advocate shall be devoted to the duties of the position, and the
Child Advocate shall receive such salary as provided by law.  A vacancy
occurring in the position of child advocate shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment, except that if the child advocate dies, resigns,
becomes ineligible to serve for any reason, or is removed from office, the
Governor shall appoint an acting Child Advocate who shall serve until the
appointment and qualification of the Child Advocate's successor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.     The Child
Advocate shall seek to ensure the provision of effective, appropriate and
timely services for children at risk of abuse and neglect in the State, and
that children under State supervision due to abuse or neglect are served adequately
and appropriately by the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Office of the Child
Advocate shall be deemed a child protective agency for the purposes of section
1 of P.L.1977, c.102 (C.9:6-8.10a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.     The Child
Advocate shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   administer the work of
the Office of the Child Advocate;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   appoint and remove such
officers, investigators, stenographic and clerical assistants, and other
personnel, in the career or unclassified service, as may be required for the
conduct of the office, subject to the provisions 26 of Title 11A of the New
Jersey Statutes, and other applicable statutes, except as provided otherwise
herein;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   formulate and adopt
rules and regulations for the efficient conduct of the work and general
administration of the office, its officers, and employees, in accordance with
the &quot;Administrative Procedure  Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.); and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   institute or cause to be
instituted such legal proceedings or processes consistent with the Rules
Governing the Courts of New Jersey as may be necessary to properly enforce and
give effect to any of the Child Advocate's powers or duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Consistent with the
provisions of federal and State law the Child Advocate shall have:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   access to, and the right
to inspect and copy, any records, including pupil records in accordance with
the provisions of N.J.S.18A:36-19, necessary to carry out the responsibilities
under this act; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   reasonable access to,
and the right to copy any records from the Department of Children and Families
Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System, or its successor,
necessary to carry out its responsibilities under this act, and only with
regard to persons who are or may be the subject of an investigation by the
child advocate, or to assess the status of an individual complaint or inquiry
to determine whether further action by the child advocate is appropriate;
except that, access provided to the Statewide Automated Child Welfare
Information System, or its successor, shall be limited to information available
through the system, unless otherwise agreed to by the child advocate and the
Department of Children and Families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Child Advocate may
issue subpoenas to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the
production of books, papers, and other documents, and administer oaths to
witnesses in any matter under the investigation of the office.  If any person
to whom such subpoena is issued fails to appear or,  having appeared, refuses
to give testimony, or fails to produce the books, papers, or other documents
required, the Child Advocate may apply to the Superior Court, which may order
the person to appear and give testimony or produce the books, papers, or other
documents, as applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Child Advocate shall
disseminate information to the public on the objectives of the office, the
services the office provides, and the methods by which the office may be
contacted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The Child Advocate
