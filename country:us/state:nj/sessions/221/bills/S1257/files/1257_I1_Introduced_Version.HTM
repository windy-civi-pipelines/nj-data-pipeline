forth how and why the same were voted.  The original statement shall be filed
with the county or municipal clerk, as the case may be; a copy of the statement

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill does not change any
other provisions of current law regarding the materials and procedures for the
use of emergency ballots (when voting machines malfunction) or provisional
ballots (when there is a problem with a voters registration record). All of
the same envelopes, affirmation statements, and voting procedures specific to
emergency ballots and provisional ballots would continue to apply. </p>
