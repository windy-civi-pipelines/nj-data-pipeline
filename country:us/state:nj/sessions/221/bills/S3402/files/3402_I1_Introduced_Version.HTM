the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish a program
through which the commissioner is required to certify an architect or engineer
who satisfies certain criteria to be a qualified design professional.  This
certification enables the person to take responsibility for a construction
projects compliance with the State Uniform Construction Code (UCC), and to
self-certify that an application for a construction permit, and the plans and
specifications submitted therewith, comply with the UCC and other applicable
laws. </p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an
enforcing agency to: accept a self-certified permit application and
accompanying documents; conduct a supervisory check acknowledging the enforcing
agencys receipt of all materials required under the UCC; and issue a permit
within one to five calendar days following receipt of a submission, depending
on the scope of the project.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the
commissioner to establish eligibility requirements for a design professional to
qualify to participate in the self-certification program.  The bill also directs
the commissioner to exclude types of projects from the self-certification
program, by reference to certain types of UCC use groups, and by reference to specific
square footage limits.  The bill further requires that a qualified design
professional remain with the project until the project is signed-off or
approved by the enforcing agency; otherwise, the enforcing agency is to require
that the project cease until satisfaction with certain criteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormalCxSpMiddle style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires
the commissioner to establish and promulgate on the Department of Community
Affairs (department) Internet website, a design professional of record
self-certification form, and requires a qualified design professional of record
to complete, sign, and deliver the completed form to the enforcing agency
together with the construction permit application and accompanying documents. 
The bill requires a qualified design professional to submit a design
professional of record self-certification statement, and the qualified design
professionals attestation concerning:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) the veracity and correctness
of information provided in the permit application, accompanying plans, and
other documents submitted in support of the application; </p>

requirements established by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the
commissioner to establish and promulgate on the departments Internet website,
an owner certification statement, and an owner hold harmless letter.  The bill
sets forth the contents of the owner certification statement and owner hold
harmless letter, which pertain to certain authorization, joint compliance responsibility
acknowledgement, and indemnification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill empowers the
department to conduct random audits of qualified design professionals to
determine whether a construction permit application, and plans and other
documents submitted in support of the application comply with the requirements
of UCC and other applicable laws.  The bill enables the commissioner to
exclude, suspend, or sanction a qualified design professional for cause for
actions specified by the bill, including failure to correct violations
identified by the audit and knowingly or negligently submitting a
self-certification, permit application, or construction document that contains
false information.  The bill also requires the commissioner to create and
maintain a searchable database on the departments Internet website of all
qualified design professionals who have been excluded from the program,
suspended, or sanctioned by the department, and requires notice of such actions
to be provided to the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors,

to prepare and submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature regarding
the self-certification program and the results of the study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill is to take effect on
