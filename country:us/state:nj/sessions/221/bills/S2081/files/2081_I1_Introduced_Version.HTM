and declares that:</p>

this State that instruction delivered in-person provides the most educational
benefit for New Jerseys students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires a board of
education to directly employ certain professionals and permits a board of
education to contract for certain personnel. This bill also permits the use of
virtual or remote instruction for public school students in certain
circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a board of
education, generally defined as the board of education of any local school
district, consolidated school district, regional school district, county
vocational school, and any other board of education or other similar body, the
board of directors of an educational services commission, and the
administrative board of a renaissance school project or any other local
education agency, is required to directly employ all persons performing any
duty, function, service, assignment, or job requiring an appropriate
certificate issued by the State Board of Examiners for, or on behalf of, a
board of education. Additionally, the bill permits a board of education to
contract with personnel to ensure required programs and services are provided
and are not required to directly employ the personnel, provided that the
personnel hold an applicable certificate. Under the bill, the personnel
include: (1) a substitute teacher; (2) personnel providing instruction in financial,
economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy to satisfy graduation
requirements; (3) personnel providing educational services to a student who is
enrolled in a school other than a public school; (4) personnel employed by

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill permits
a board of education to contract for additional services provided that the

board contracts with specific entities. Under the bill, these services include
(1) independent child study team evaluations; (2) child study team services to
supplement existing district services; (3) home instruction; (4)
speech-language services in certain circumstances; and (5) related services,
provided that certified occupational therapy assistants, others employed in a
supportive role to licensed certified providers of related services, physical
therapy assistants, and specialists in behavior modification meet additional
requirements, as specified in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also permits an
approved private school for students with disabilities to contract for certain
services, provided that the personnel holds an applicable certificate on a
non-emergency basis and the approved private school for students with disabilities
contracts with specific entities. Under the bill, these services include
speech-language services and related services, provided that certified
occupational therapy assistants, others employed in a supportive role to
licensed certified providers of related services, physical therapy assistants,
and specialists in behavior modification meet additional requirements, as
specified in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires
instructional services provided by a school district, including a charter
school or a renaissance school project, to be delivered through in-person
methods unless otherwise permitted by State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill permits
a school district to utilize individualized virtual or remote instruction for a
student when equivalent instruction cannot be provided through in-person
instruction, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Education and
establishes an application process for a school district to apply for
individualized virtual or remote instruction for a student. Under the bill, the
commissioner is required to establish a process for notifying an individual
currently providing the instructional services which are being sought to be
implemented virtually or remotely, and the majority representative of the
districts employees of the submission of an application and provide them with
a copy of the application and notice of the right to object to, or comment on,
the application prior to the commissioners determination. Additionally, the
bill requires the commissioner to establish a process to notify a school
district, any individual currently providing the instructional services which
are being sought to be implemented virtually or remotely, and the majority
representative of the districts employees regarding a determination on the
request for virtual or remote instruction and a procedure for a school district
to them to appeal the determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also permits a board
of education, as part of the districts implementation of school graduation
requirements for a State-endorsed diploma to provide instruction in financial,
economic, business, and entrepreneurial literacy by virtual or remote
instruction, either in whole or in part.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill specifies
that individualized student learning opportunities that meet or exceed the New
Jersey Student Learning Standards for students in grades nine through 12
include (1) independent study, (2) study abroad programs, (3) student exchange
programs, (4) credit recovery programs; and (5) structured learning
experiences, including, but not limited to, work-based programs, internships,
apprenticeships, and service-learning experiences. Under the bill, the board is
to determine if an individualized student learning opportunity may be completed
by virtual or remote instruction, either in whole or in part. Pursuant to the
bill, individualized student learning opportunities are required to apply
toward the credit requirement for a State-endorsed diploma established under
State Board of Education regulations.</p>
