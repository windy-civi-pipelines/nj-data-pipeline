<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 11 of P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-12) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  It shall be an unlawful
employment practice, or, as the case may be, an unlawful discrimination:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     For an employer,
because of the race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital
status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual
orientation, genetic information, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender
identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood
trait of any individual, or because of the liability for service in the Armed
Forces of the United States or the nationality of any individual, or because of
the refusal to submit to a genetic test or make available the results of a
genetic test to an employer, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to
discharge or require to retire, unless justified by lawful considerations other
than age, from employment such individual or to discriminate against such
individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment;
provided, however, it shall not be an unlawful employment practice to refuse to
accept for employment an applicant who has received a notice of induction or
orders to report for active duty in the armed forces; provided further that
nothing herein contained shall be construed to bar an employer from refusing to
accept for employment any person on the basis of sex in those certain
circumstances where sex is a bona fide occupational qualification, reasonably
necessary to the normal operation of the particular business or enterprise;
provided further that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for a
club exclusively social or fraternal to use club membership as a uniform
qualification for employment, or for a religious association or organization to
utilize religious affiliation as a uniform qualification in the employment of
clergy, religious teachers or other employees engaged in the religious
activities of the association or organization, or in following the tenets of
its religion in establishing and utilizing criteria for employment of an
employee; provided further, that it shall not be an unlawful employment
practice to require the retirement of any employee who, for the two-year period
immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high
policy-making position, if that employee is entitled to an immediate
non-forfeitable annual retirement benefit from a pension, profit sharing,
savings or deferred retirement plan, or any combination of those plans, of the
employer of that employee which equals in the aggregate at least $27,000.00;
and provided further that an employer may restrict employment to citizens of
the United States where such restriction is required by federal law or is
otherwise necessary to protect the national interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The provisions of subsections
a. and b. of section 57 of P.L.2003, c.246 (C.34:11A-20), and the provisions of
section 58 of P.L.2003, c.246 (C.26:8A-11), shall not be deemed to be an
unlawful discrimination under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, a &quot;bona fide executive&quot; is a top level employee who
exercises substantial executive authority over a significant number of
employees and a large volume of business.  A &quot;high policy-making
position&quot; is a position in which a person plays a significant role in
developing policy and in recommending the implementation thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, an unlawful employment practice occurs, with respect to
discrimination in compensation or in the financial terms or conditions of
employment, each occasion that an individual is affected by application of a
discriminatory compensation decision or other practice, including, but not
limited to, each occasion that wages, benefits, or other compensation are paid,
resulting in whole or in part from the decision or other practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any other
relief authorized by the &quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for discrimination in compensation or in the financial
terms or conditions of employment, liability shall accrue and an aggrieved
person may obtain relief for back pay for the entire period of time, except not
more than six years, in which the violation with regard to discrimination in
compensation or in the financial terms or conditions of employment has been
continuous, if the violation continues to occur within the statute of
limitations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this subsection
shall prohibit the application of the doctrine of &quot;continuing
violation&quot; or the &quot;discovery rule&quot; to any appropriate claim as
those doctrines currently exist in New Jersey common law.  It shall be an
unlawful employment practice to require employees or prospective employees to
consent to a shortened statute of limitations or to waive any of the
protections provided by the &quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    For a labor
organization, because of the race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry,
age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status,
affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability,
pregnancy or breastfeeding, or sex of any individual, or because of the
liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality
of any individual, to exclude or to expel from its membership such individual
or to discriminate in any way against any of its members, against any applicant
for, or individual included in, any apprentice or other training program or
against any employer or any individual employed by an employer; provided,
however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed to bar a labor
organization from excluding from its apprentice or other training programs any
person on the basis of sex in those certain circumstances where sex is a bona
fide occupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
the particular apprentice or other training program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     For any employer or
employment agency to print or circulate or cause to be printed or circulated
any statement, advertisement or publication, or to use any form of application
for employment, or to make an inquiry in connection with prospective
employment, which expresses, directly or indirectly, any limitation,
specification or discrimination as to race, creed, color, national origin,
ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status,
affectional or sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability,
nationality, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or sex or liability of any applicant
for employment for service in the Armed Forces of the United States, or any

express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that
providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations
of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in
terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the
accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and
paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or
breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than
accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy
or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This
subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any
employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with
pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section &quot;pregnancy or breastfeeding&quot; means pregnancy, childbirth, and
breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from
childbirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the
employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking
into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business
necessity requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     For an employer to pay
any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of
compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the
employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for
substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and
responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the
characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education
or experience, or the quantity or quality of production;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the factor or
factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   That each of the factors
is applied reasonably;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   That one or more of the
factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   That the factors are
job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate
business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it
is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve
the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Comparisons of wage rates
shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. 
For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;member of a protected class&quot;
means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed,
color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union
status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic
information, pregnancy, <u>breastfeeding</u> sex, gender identity or
expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any
individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection
a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or

against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of
employment.</p>

protections provided in the Law Against Discrimination to working mothers who
are breast feeding.  Specifically, the bill provides that an employer is

entitled to reasonable break time paid at the employees regular rate of
compensation, job restructuring, and a modified work schedule for the purpose
of milk expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, the bill requires an
employer to provide a suitable room or other location with privacy, free from
intrusion of other employees or customers of the employers business, if
