and in the same condition as when it was delivered by the dealer to the
consumer, except for reasonable wear and tear and any defect or mechanical
problem that manifests or becomes evident after delivery that was not caused by

the right to cancel the contract under the terms of the contract cancellation
option agreement, and the last date and time by which the option to cancel may
be exercised, followed by a line for the consumers signature. A particular
form of statement is not required, but the following statement is sufficient:
By signing below, I elect to exercise my right to cancel the contract for the
used motor vehicle described in this agreement.  The consumers delivery of
the contract cancellation agreement to the dealer with the consumers signature
following this statement shall constitute sufficient written notice that the consumer
is exercising the right to cancel a contract pursuant to paragraph (6) of this
subsection.  The dealer shall provide the consumer with the statement required

After the consumer exercises the right to cancel a contract under the contract
cancellation option agreement, the dealer shall cancel the contract and provide
the consumer with a full refund, including the appropriate portion of the sales
tax or other fees paid, within three business days for a used motor vehicle
purchased by cash, credit or debit card, or bank loan, or 10 business days for
a used motor vehicle purchased by check.</span></p>

If the consumer was not charged for the contract cancellation option agreement,
the dealer shall return to the consumer, within three business days after the
consumer exercises the right to cancel the contract, any used motor vehicle the
consumer conveyed to the dealer as a down payment or trade-in.  If the dealer
sold or otherwise transferred title to the used motor vehicle that was conveyed
as a down payment or trade-in, the full refund described in paragraph (1) of
this subsection shall include the fair market value of the used motor vehicle
left as a down payment or trade-in, or its value as stated in the contract,
whichever is greater.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      (3) 
If the consumer was charged for the contract cancellation option agreement, the
dealer shall retain any motor vehicle the consumer conveyed to the dealer as a
down payment or trade-in until the consumer exercises the right to cancel or
the right to cancel expires. If the consumer exercises the right to cancel the
contract, the dealer shall return to the consumer, within three business days after
which the consumer exercises the right to cancel the contract, any motor
vehicle the consumer conveyed to the dealer as a down payment or trade-in.  If
the dealer has inadvertently sold or otherwise transferred title to the motor
vehicle as the result of a bona fide error, despite taking reasonable
procedures to avoid that error, the inadvertent sale or transfer of title shall
not be deemed a violation of this paragraph, and the full refund described in
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include the retail market value of the

been returned pursuant to this section.  This subsection does not abrogate or

option agreement gives the consumer the right to cancel the contract and obtain
a refund.  The bill sets forth the information to be contained in any contract
cancellation option agreement, including the deadline for exercising the
cancellation option and returning the vehicle to the dealer, the maximum
mileage the vehicle may be driven, which could not be less than 250 miles, and
any restocking fee.  A dealer would be required to apply toward the restocking
fee the price paid by the consumer for the contract cancellation option
agreement.  A dealer also is required to give notice at its business location
and in the contract for the used motor vehicle that there is no cancellation
period, sometimes referred to as a cooling-off period, unless a consumer
obtains a contract cancellation option.  Under the bill, the requirement that a
dealer offer a contract cancellation option to a consumer does not apply to
total loss or salvage vehicles.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the fee
for the contract cancellation option agreement is not to exceed the following:
(1) $75 for a used motor vehicle with a cash price of $5,000 or less; (2) $150
for a used motor vehicle with a cash price of between $5,000.01 and $10,000;
(3) $250 for a used motor vehicle with a cash price of between $10,000.01 and
$30,000; or (4) one percent of the purchase price for a used motor vehicle with
a cash price of $30,000.01 to $40,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, after a
consumer exercises the right to cancel a contract under the agreement, no later
than three business days for a used motor vehicle purchased by cash, credit or
debit card, or bank loan, or 10 business days for a used motor vehicle
purchased by check, the dealer is required to cancel the contract and provide
the consumer with a refund, including the appropriate portion of the sales tax
or other fees paid.  In addition, within three business days, a dealer would be
required to return to the consumer any used vehicle the consumer conveyed to
the dealer as a down payment or trade-in.  If the dealer sold or otherwise
transferred title to that used vehicle, the refund would include the fair
market value of that used vehicle or its value as stated in the contract,
whichever is greater.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, P.L.1995, c.373
(C.56:8-67 et seq.) sets forth minimum warranty requirements when a dealer
sells to a consumer a used vehicle.  Under current law, in the event that a
used motor vehicle is sold as is, it is an unlawful practice for a dealer to
fail to provide a clear written explanation, prior to sale, of what is meant by
the term as is.  The bill amends current law to make it an unlawful practice
under the consumer fraud act for a dealer to sell a consumer a used vehicle as
is, i.e., without any warranty.  The bill eliminates the existing ability of a
dealer to sell a consumer a used vehicle as is as a result of negotiating a
lower price in exchange for waiving the dealers obligation to provide a
warranty.  The bill revises the mileage requirements under the dealers
required written warranty.  If the motor vehicle has less than 40,000 miles,
the warranty would be 90 days or 3,750 miles, whichever comes first.  If the
motor vehicle has 40,000 miles or more, but less than 80,000 miles, the
warranty would be 60 days or 2,500 miles, whichever comes first.  If the used
motor vehicle has 80,000 miles or more, but less than 125,000 miles, the
warranty would be 30 days or 1,250 miles, whichever comes first.  If the used
motor vehicle has 125,000 miles or more, a consumer would be entitled to any
implied warranties created by law.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a dealer may
sell a used motor vehicle as is and is not required to provide a written
warranty to a consumer if the used motor vehicle has been issued a salvage
certificate of title by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission or declared a
total loss by an insurance company, of if the used motor vehicle has been
reported as a salvage vehicle or as a total loss in a National Motor Vehicle
Title Information System history report.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An unlawful practice under the
consumer fraud act is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000
for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. 
Additionally, violations may result in cease and desist orders issued by the
Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages, and the awarding of
treble damages and costs to the injured party.</p>
