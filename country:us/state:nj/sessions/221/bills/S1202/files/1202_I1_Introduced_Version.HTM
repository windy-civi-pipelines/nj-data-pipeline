(cf: P.L.2020, c.151, s.2) 6.    (New section) The change to the definition of child made pursuant to the amendment of section 6 of P.L.1954, c.84 (C.43:15A-6) by P.L.     , c.      (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and the adjustment in the benefit to a surviving widow or widower or a surviving child or children made pursuant to section 3 of P.L.   , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall apply to a benefit entitlement initially granted on or after September 11, 2001 when the member was a World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations responder and on or after January 1, 2021 for all other members, and, if granted on or after that date but before the effective date of P.L.    , c.      (pending before the Legislature as this bill), still in effect on that effective date.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 10 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-10) restricting the accidental death benefit to applications filed within five years of the date of a members or retirants death,  or any other provision of law to the contrary, a widow or widower, child or children, parent, eligible individual, or other beneficiary, as applicable, shall be permitted to file, within 180 days of the effective date of this act, an application for an accidental death benefit based upon the death of a retirant due to an accident met in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or service in the reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a federal active duty status. 8.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases to 70 percent of compensation the accidental death benefit payable to the surviving spouse or surviving child or children of a deceased law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter who was a member of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and ineligible for membership in the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS), and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant.  This bill also changes the definition of child with respect to those members.  The bill permits payment of an accidental death benefit to a surviving beneficiary of a retirant of the PFRS or a retirant of the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS if the accident caused the death of the retirant.  The bill also grants eligibility for the death benefit to a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety Officers Benefits Act of 1976 based upon the death of a law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant of the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS or member or retirant of the PFRS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant . Under current law, an accidental death benefit under PERS is payable when a member dies accidentally in the actual performance of duty, or in active service in the reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a federal active duty status, and not as the result of his or her willful negligence.  The members widow or widower is entitled to a pension of 50 percent of the members compensation for use by him or her and the children of the deceased member.  This payment continues during his or her widowhood.  If there is no surviving widow or widower, or in case the widow or widower dies or remarries, 20 percent of that compensation is payable to one surviving child, 35 percent to two surviving children in equal shares, and 50 percent to three or more surviving children in equal shares. With respect to all law enforcement officers, correction officers, or firefighters in PERS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant, this bill increases to 70 percent of the members compensation the accidental death benefit payable to the surviving spouse of the member or retirant, and to the same amount the benefit payable to the members or retirants surviving child or children when there is no surviving spouse.  This provision will mirror the amounts as provided in the PFRS. This bill also changes the definition of child with respect to all law enforcement officers, correction officers, and firefighters in PERS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant. Currently, in that retirement system, child is defined as a deceased member's unmarried child either (a) under the age of 18 or (b) of any age who, at the time of the member's death, is disabled because of an intellectual disability or physical incapacity, is unable to do any substantial, gainful work because of the impairment and the impairment has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as affirmed by the medical board. For those officers and firefighters in PERS, this bill adds to this definition a members or retirants child who is (c) 18 years of age or older and enrolled in a secondary school, or (d) under the age of 24 and enrolled in a degree program in an institution of higher education for at least 12 credit hours in each semester, provided that the member or retirant died as a result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, and the death was not the result of the member's or retirants willful misconduct.  This definition will be the same as the definition of child in the PFRS, as amended to include retirants. Finally, the bill provides that a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety Officers Benefits Act of 1976 (PSOB) based upon the death of a law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant in the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS is eligible to receive the accidental death benefit, and the same for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant.  The bill provides the same eligibility for a person determined by the bureau to be eligible for a death benefit under the PSOB for a member or retirant in the PFRS.

No such application shall be valid or acted upon unless it is filed in the office of the retirement system within five years of the date of such death. The provisions of this subsection shall also apply to a member who is a fireman, or retirant who was a fireman, and who dies as a result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty as a volunteer fireman in any municipality in the State, provided the member's or retirants death was not the result of the member's or retirants willful negligence. [(2)] b.     Upon the receipt of proper proofs of the death of a member or retirant on account of which an accidental death benefit is payable, there shall be paid to [his ] the members or retirants widow or widower a pension of 70% of the compensation upon which contributions by the member or retirant to the annuity savings fund were based in the last year of creditable service, or a pension of $50,000 when death occurs on or after the effective date of P.L.2020, c.151, whichever is greater, for the use of herself or himself and the children of the deceased member or retirant; if there is no surviving widow or widower or in case the widow or widower dies, 70% of such compensation will be payable to the member's or retirants  surviving child or surviving children in equal shares.

In the event of accidental death occurring in the first year of creditable service, the benefits, payable pursuant to this subsection, shall be computed at the annual rate of compensation. [(3)] c.     If there is no surviving widow, widower, child or dependent parent, there shall be paid to any other beneficiary of the deceased member or retirant, [his] the members or retirants aggregate contributions at the time of death. [(4)] d.     In no case shall the death benefit provided in subsection [(2)] b. be less than that provided under subsection [(3)] c.

[(6)] f.      In addition to the foregoing benefits, the State shall pay to the member's or retirants employer-sponsored health insurance program all health insurance premiums for the coverage of the member's or retirants surviving widow or widower and dependent children. g.  An individual who has been determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be eligible to receive a death benefit under the Public Safety Officers Benefits Act of 1976 (34 U.S.C.S. s.10281 et seq.) based upon the death of a member or retirant shall be eligible to receive the benefit provided under and in accordance with subsection b. of this section.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of section 10 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-10) restricting the accidental death benefit to applications filed within five years of the date of a members or retirants death,  or any other provision of law to the contrary, a widow or widower, child or children, parent, eligible individual, or other beneficiary, as applicable, shall be permitted to file, within 180 days of the effective date of this act, an application for an accidental death benefit based upon the death of a retirant due to an accident met in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, or service in the reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a federal active duty status. 8.   This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill increases to 70 percent of compensation the accidental death benefit payable to the surviving spouse or surviving child or children of a deceased law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter who was a member of the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) and ineligible for membership in the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS), and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant.  This bill also changes the definition of child with respect to those members.  The bill permits payment of an accidental death benefit to a surviving beneficiary of a retirant of the PFRS or a retirant of the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS if the accident caused the death of the retirant.  The bill also grants eligibility for the death benefit to a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety Officers Benefits Act of 1976 based upon the death of a law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant of the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS or member or retirant of the PFRS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant . Under current law, an accidental death benefit under PERS is payable when a member dies accidentally in the actual performance of duty, or in active service in the reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard in a federal active duty status, and not as the result of his or her willful negligence.  The members widow or widower is entitled to a pension of 50 percent of the members compensation for use by him or her and the children of the deceased member.  This payment continues during his or her widowhood.  If there is no surviving widow or widower, or in case the widow or widower dies or remarries, 20 percent of that compensation is payable to one surviving child, 35 percent to two surviving children in equal shares, and 50 percent to three or more surviving children in equal shares. With respect to all law enforcement officers, correction officers, or firefighters in PERS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant, this bill increases to 70 percent of the members compensation the accidental death benefit payable to the surviving spouse of the member or retirant, and to the same amount the benefit payable to the members or retirants surviving child or children when there is no surviving spouse.  This provision will mirror the amounts as provided in the PFRS. This bill also changes the definition of child with respect to all law enforcement officers, correction officers, and firefighters in PERS, and for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant. Currently, in that retirement system, child is defined as a deceased member's unmarried child either (a) under the age of 18 or (b) of any age who, at the time of the member's death, is disabled because of an intellectual disability or physical incapacity, is unable to do any substantial, gainful work because of the impairment and the impairment has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, as affirmed by the medical board. For those officers and firefighters in PERS, this bill adds to this definition a members or retirants child who is (c) 18 years of age or older and enrolled in a secondary school, or (d) under the age of 24 and enrolled in a degree program in an institution of higher education for at least 12 credit hours in each semester, provided that the member or retirant died as a result of an accident met in the actual performance of duty at some definite time and place, and the death was not the result of the member's or retirants willful misconduct.  This definition will be the same as the definition of child in the PFRS, as amended to include retirants. Finally, the bill provides that a person determined by the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance to be eligible to receive a death benefit under the federal Public Safety Officers Benefits Act of 1976 (PSOB) based upon the death of a law enforcement officer, correction officer, or firefighter member or retirant in the PERS who was ineligible for membership in the PFRS is eligible to receive the accidental death benefit, and the same for an emergency medical technician, paramedic, hazardous materials emergency first responder, and fire instructor member or retirant.  The bill provides the same eligibility for a person determined by the bureau to be eligible for a death benefit under the PSOB for a member or retirant in the PFRS.
