Whereas, The blueberry muffin is a delicious snack that is rich in flavor and enjoyed by residents throughout the State of New Jersey and the United States; and Whereas, The blueberry muffin is incredibly versatile, able to serve as part of a healthy breakfast or as a sweet and decadent dessert; and Whereas, Blueberries taste good, are high in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants, are sodium and cholesterol-free, are low in calories, and may provide medical and health benefits, including helping to prevent cancer and heart disease; and Whereas, The key to creating a delicious and flavorful blueberry muffin is using fresh blueberries grown in the fertile and acidic soils of New Jersey; and Whereas, Our State has a rich and long-standing association with the blueberry which, due to its mouthwatering taste, its many nutritional and health benefits, and its indisputable economic importance, was designated as the official State Fruit in 2003; and Whereas, The highbush blueberry is indigenous to New Jersey, where it was first cultivated for commercial production by Elizabeth White and Frederick Covile, who in the early 1900s dedicated themselves to the study, domestication, and breeding of blueberries at Whitesbog, in Browns Mills, New Jersey; and Whereas, In 1916, White and Coville harvested and sold the first commercial crop of highbush blueberries, and soon thereafter blueberry fever swept the country; and Whereas, Today, New Jersey is consistently among the top-five producers of blueberries in the nation, producing approximately 50 million pounds of blueberries worth an estimated $70 million annually; and Whereas, In the heart of southern New Jersey, Hammonton, in Atlantic County, is widely recognized as the Blueberry Capital of the World; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for the State of New Jersey to officially acknowledge the importance and delightful taste of the blueberry muffin; now, therefore, Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The blueberry muffin is designated as the New Jersey State Muffin. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill designates the blueberry muffin as the New Jersey State Muffin. New Jersey is the home of the commercial blueberry, which was first domesticated in Browns Mills in the early 20th century by Elizabeth White and Frederick Covile.  White and Coville accomplished this by selectively breeding the native highbush blueberry over the course of many years.  Blueberries now make up a significant proportion of New Jerseys agricultural economy and New Jersey is consistently among the top-five producers of blueberries in the nation, producing approximately 50 million pounds of blueberries worth an estimated $70 million annually. Blueberries taste good, are high in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants, are sodium and cholesterol-free, are low in calories, and may provide medical and health benefits, including helping to prevent cancer and heart disease.  Blueberry muffins are able to highlight both the healthfulness and the great taste of the blueberry, since they can be enjoyed as a high fiber breakfast food, or as a sweet dessert. It is therefore proper and fitting for the State of New Jersey to recognize the significance of the blueberry to the State and the delightful taste of the blueberry muffin by designating the blueberry muffin as the New Jersey State Muffin.
