STATEMENT This bill revises the requirements for infertility coverage under certain health insurance plans. Current law requires health insurance plans issued by hospital, medical and health service corporations, commercial group insurers, health maintenance organizations, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Plan to provide coverage for medically necessary expenses incurred in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, including expenses incurred in in vitro fertilization.  Health insurance plans may limit coverage of in vitro fertilization to a covered person who: has used all reasonable, less expensive and medically appropriate treatments and is still unable to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy; has not reached the limit of four completed egg retrievals; and is 45 years of age or younger. Under the bill, health insurance plans could no longer limit the coverage of in vitro fertilization, but would be required to cover in vitro fertilization to the extent and under the same conditions as coverage is required for other infertility treatments.

STATEMENT This bill revises the requirements for infertility coverage under certain health insurance plans. Current law requires health insurance plans issued by hospital, medical and health service corporations, commercial group insurers, health maintenance organizations, the State Health Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Plan to provide coverage for medically necessary expenses incurred in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, including expenses incurred in in vitro fertilization.  Health insurance plans may limit coverage of in vitro fertilization to a covered person who: has used all reasonable, less expensive and medically appropriate treatments and is still unable to become pregnant or carry a pregnancy; has not reached the limit of four completed egg retrievals; and is 45 years of age or younger. Under the bill, health insurance plans could no longer limit the coverage of in vitro fertilization, but would be required to cover in vitro fertilization to the extent and under the same conditions as coverage is required for other infertility treatments.
