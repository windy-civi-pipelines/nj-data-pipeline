Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.2001,
c.236 (C.17:48-6x) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A hospital service
corporation contract which provides hospital or medical expense benefits for
groups with more than 50 persons, which includes pregnancy-related benefits,
shall not be delivered, issued, executed or renewed in this State, or approved
for issuance or renewal in this State by the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance on or after the effective date of this act unless the contract
provides coverage for persons covered under the contract for medically
necessary expenses incurred in the diagnosis and treatment of infertility as
provided pursuant to this section.  The hospital service corporation contract
shall provide coverage which includes, but is not limited to, the following
services related to infertility: diagnosis and diagnostic tests; medications;
surgery; in vitro fertilization; embryo transfer; artificial insemination;
gamete intra fallopian transfer; zygote intra fallopian transfer;
intracytoplasmic sperm injection; and four completed egg retrievals per
lifetime of the covered person.  The hospital service corporation may provide
that coverage for <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>in
vitro fertilization,<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
gamete intra fallopian transfer and zygote intra fallopian transfer shall be
limited to a covered person who: a. has used all reasonable, less expensive and
medically appropriate treatments and is still unable to become pregnant or
carry a pregnancy; b. has not reached the limit of four completed egg
retrievals; and c. is 45 years of age or younger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of this section,
&quot;infertility&quot; means a disease or condition that results in the
abnormal function of the reproductive system, as determined pursuant to
American Society for Reproductive Medicine practice guidelines by a physician
who is Board Certified or Board Eligible in Reproductive Endocrinology and
Infertility or in Obstetrics and Gynecology or that the patient has met one of
the following conditions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A male is unable to
impregnate a female;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A female with a male
partner and under 35 years of age is unable to conceive after 12 months of
unprotected sexual intercourse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A female with a male
partner and 35 years of age and over is unable to conceive after six months of
unprotected sexual intercourse;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A female without a male
partner and under 35 years of age who is unable to conceive after 12 failed
attempts of intrauterine insemination under medical supervision;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   A female without a male
partner and over 35 years of age who is unable to conceive after six failed
attempts of intrauterine insemination under medical supervision;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Partners are unable to
conceive as a result of involuntary medical sterility;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   A person is unable to
carry a pregnancy to live birth; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   A previous determination
of infertility pursuant to this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The benefits shall be provided
to the same extent as for other pregnancy-related procedures under the
contract, except that the services provided for in this section shall be
performed at facilities that conform to standards established by the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine or the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists.  The same copayments, deductibles and benefit limits shall apply
to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility pursuant to this section as those
applied to other medical or surgical benefits under the contract.  Infertility
resulting from voluntary sterilization procedures shall be excluded under the
contract for the coverage required by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A religious employer may
request, and a hospital service corporation shall grant, an exclusion under the
contract for the coverage required by this section for in vitro fertilization,
embryo transfer, artificial insemination, zygote intra fallopian transfer and
intracytoplasmic sperm injection, if the required coverage is contrary to the
religious employer's bona fide religious tenets.  The hospital service
corporation that issues a contract containing such an exclusion shall provide
written notice thereof to each prospective subscriber or subscriber, which shall
appear in not less than 10 point type, in the contract, application and sales
brochure.  For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;religious employer&quot;
means an employer that is a church, convention or association of churches or
any group or entity that is operated, supervised or controlled by or in
connection with a church or a convention or association of churches as defined
in 26 U.S.C. s.3121(w)(3)(A), and that qualifies as a tax-exempt organization
under 26 U.S.C. s.501(c)(3).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     This section shall apply
to those hospital service corporation contracts in which the hospital service
corporation has reserved the right to change the premium.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The provisions of this
section shall not apply to a hospital service corporation contract which,
pursuant to a contract between the hospital service corporation and the
Department of Human Services, provides benefits to persons who are eligible for
medical assistance under P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.), the NJ FamilyCare
Program established pursuant to P.L.2005, c.156 (C.30:4J-8 et al.), or any
other program administered by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For purposes of this section,
&quot;infertility&quot; means a disease or condition that results in the
abnormal function of the reproductive system, as determined pursuant to
American Society for Reproductive Medicine practice guidelines by a physician who
is Board Certified or Board Eligible in Reproductive Endocrinology and
Infertility or in Obstetrics and Gynecology or any one of the following

partner and under 35 years of age is unable to conceive after 12 months of
unprotected sexual intercourse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   A female with a male

contract, except that the services provided for in this section shall be
performed at facilities that conform to standards established by the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine or the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists. The same copayments, deductibles and benefit limits shall apply
to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility pursuant to this section as those
applied to other medical or surgical benefits under the contract.  Infertility
resulting from voluntary sterilization procedures shall be excluded under the
contract for the coverage required by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the
requirements for infertility coverage under certain health insurance plans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law requires health
insurance plans issued by hospital, medical and health service corporations,
commercial group insurers, health maintenance organizations, the State Health
Benefits Program, and the School Employees Health Benefits Plan to provide
coverage for medically necessary expenses incurred in the diagnosis and
treatment of infertility, including expenses incurred in in vitro
fertilization.  Health insurance plans may limit coverage of in vitro
fertilization to a covered person who: has used all reasonable, less expensive
and medically appropriate treatments and is still unable to become pregnant or
carry a pregnancy; has not reached the limit of four completed egg retrievals;
and is 45 years of age or younger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, health insurance
plans could no longer limit the coverage of in vitro fertilization, but would
be required to cover in vitro fertilization to the extent and under the same
conditions as coverage is required for other infertility treatments.</p>
