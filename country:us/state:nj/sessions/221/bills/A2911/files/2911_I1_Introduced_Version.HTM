medical office and on the practitioners or the practitioners professional
corporations website, if applicable.  The disclosure that is posted by the
practitioner in the office and on the website need not contain the specific
information regarding participation in the network of a patients health plan
as provided in subsection b. of this section, but shall list those health plans
in which the out-of-State health services is a participating provider.</p>

that health care service. </p>

also requires that this disclosure include a list of health care service
providers located within the county and contiguous counties in New Jersey that
offer the same service for which the referral is being made, and indicate whether
the out-of-State health care service will be considered to be, and reimbursed
at, an out-of-network level by your health plan or other third party payer. 
This disclosure shall also include information related to any additional
transportation costs that may be incurred by the patient or another party as a
result of the referral to an out-of-State health care service.</p>
