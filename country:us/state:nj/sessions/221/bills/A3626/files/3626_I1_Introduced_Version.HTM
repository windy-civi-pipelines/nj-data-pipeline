to the bills provisions, to:  1) designate or establish a permanent morgue for
the storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die during
non-emergent times; and 2) designate, establish, acquire, or contract with a
third-party to provide a refrigerated vehicle, mobile cold storage unit, or
other makeshift facility or area, or a combination thereof, for use by the
nursing home as supplemental emergency morgue space in times of public
emergency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require

placed into service within 72 hours after the declaration of any public
emergency or, if a public emergency is ongoing on the effective date of this
bill, within 72 hours after this bills effective date.  The emergency morgue
space is to remain in service on the premises of the nursing home until the
public emergency is declared to be over, unless the space is mobile and is temporarily
moved off-site for the purposes of directly transporting dead bodies for
autopsy or final disposition.  Emergency morgue space is to be deployed, in
accordance with these requirements, regardless of whether the nursing home has
adopted a long-term plan for the temporary on-site storage of dead bodies, as
provided by the bill; however, any emergency morgue space deployed before a

describe how the nursing home will satisfy the bills requirements, whether
through the construction of a new building, the construction of an addition to

to the bills provisions; identify the third-party provider, if any, who will
provide or who is currently providing the emergency morgue space; and describe
the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by the nursing home and
any contracted third-party provider to ensure that the supplemental emergency

cold storage plan is to identify the maximum number of dead bodies and the
percentage of the nursing homes total patient or resident capacity that can be
safely, humanely, and simultaneously stored within the confines of the nursing
homes permanent morgue and within the confines of the nursing homes emergency
morgue space, and is to further describe the means, methods, and procedures
that will be used by the nursing home to ensure that its emergency morgue space
remains sufficient for its needs.</p>

required to review an initial or revised plan submitted pursuant to the bill
and approve or conditionally approve the plan either within 30 days after
receipt thereof or, if the plan is submitted as part of an application for
licensure, upon the departments issuance of a license to the applicant.  If
the plan is conditionally approved, the nursing home will be required to adopt
and implement the plan in accordance with any mandatory revisions identified by
the department.  If the department does not respond to the submission, the plan
will be deemed approved on a non-conditional basis, and the nursing home may
proceed to implement the plan without change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A nursing home will be
required to ensure that its permanent morgue is fully constructed or otherwise
made functional, and is placed into service in accordance with the nursing
homes plan, within one year after the plan is approved or conditionally
approved or within any extended period of time, as authorized by the
commissioner, which may be necessary to ensure proper construction of the
permanent morgue.  Any request for an extension of the 180-day statutorily
mandated timeframe is to be submitted by the nursing home as an addendum to its
initial plan; however, a nursing home will not be eligible for an extension of
time if it is planning to use a mobile morgue space as a permanent morgue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any area used as a permanent
morgue and any vehicle, cold storage unit, or other makeshift area used as
emergency morgue space under the bill is to:  1) be located on, or immediately
adjacent to, the premises of the nursing home at all times during use, except
that a mobile morgue space may be temporarily moved off-site when transporting
dead bodies for autopsy or final disposition; 2) be closed-off and isolated
from public view and removed, to the greatest extent practicable, from patient
or resident living quarters and common areas; 3) be fully refrigerated or
contain refrigeration or freezer drawers or other cold storage areas where dead
bodies will be stored; 4) be of suitable construction, contain appropriate
equipment, and be of sufficient size, as provided by the bill, to ensure the
lawful, safe, respectful, and humane handling and storage of dead bodies; 5)
have lockable doors; 6) be equipped with alarms to signal intrusion and
unacceptable temperature variations; 7) have surfaces and flooring constructed
of nonporous materials; and 8) be equipped with a working sink or other hand
sanitizing station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would prohibit
eating, drinking, smoking, and the application of cosmetics or contact lenses
in any permanent morgue or emergency morgue space, and it would require
personal protective equipment (PPE) to be worn by staff while handling dead
bodies for the bills purposes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require a
nursing home to ensure that each dead body is transferred to another party for
the purposes of autopsy or final disposition, during non-emergent periods, as
soon as possible, but not more than five days, after the body is placed into
cold storage or, if a public emergency is ongoing or is declared while the body
is in storage, as soon as may be practicable in the context of the public
emergency.  When moving a dead body into or out of cold storage, the nursing
home is to ensure that the dead body:  1) is placed in a secure, closed
container or is otherwise isolated from public view; and 2) is moved in a
manner, and using equipment, that protects the health and wellbeing of the
other patients or residents of the nursing home, and of nursing home staff, to
the greatest extent practicable.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a
nursing home to maintain certain records in association with is storage and
transfer of dead bodies under the bill, and it authorizes the commissioner to: 
1) inspect permanent morgues and emergency morgue spaces; 2) investigate
complaints about the maltreatment or inappropriate storage of dead bodies by
nursing homes; 3) order nursing homes to cease and desist unlawful activities
and undertake corrective actions; and 4) seek injunctive relief and recover
civil monetary penalties in association with any violation of the
commissioners orders.  Any nursing home that fails to comply with an order of
the commissioner will be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for
a first offense and not more than $5,000 for a second or subsequent offense, to
be collected in a summary proceeding.</p>
