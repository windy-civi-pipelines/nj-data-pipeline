or (2)   if a public emergency is ongoing or is declared while the body is in storage, as soon as may be practicable in the context of the public emergency. b.    The handling and transfer of dead bodies pursuant to this act shall be done safely, respectfully, humanely, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. c.     In effectuating the transfer of a dead body to or from cold storage pursuant to this act, the nursing home shall ensure that the dead body: (1)   is placed in a secure, closed container or is otherwise isolated from public view; and (2)   is moved in and out of cold storage in a manner, and using equipment, that protects the health and wellbeing of the other patients or residents of the nursing home, and of nursing home staff, to the greatest extent practicable. 6.    a.  In addition to any other records required by law, a nursing home shall maintain complete and accurate records of its storage and transfer of dead bodies pursuant to this act.  Such records shall be maintained for a period of five years. b.    The records maintained pursuant to this section shall include: (1)   a death certificate or other documentation showing the declared date and time of death and, to the extent known, the cause of death for each dead body placed in cold storage;

STATEMENT This bill would require each nursing home in the State, in compliance with a long-term plan adopted pursuant to the bills provisions, to:  1) designate or establish a permanent morgue for the storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die during non-emergent times; and 2) designate, establish, acquire, or contract with a third-party to provide a refrigerated vehicle, mobile cold storage unit, or other makeshift facility or area, or a combination thereof, for use by the nursing home as supplemental emergency morgue space in times of public emergency. The bill would require emergency morgue space to be deployed on the premises of the nursing home and placed into service within 72 hours after the declaration of any public emergency or, if a public emergency is ongoing on the effective date of this bill, within 72 hours after this bills effective date.  The emergency morgue space is to remain in service on the premises of the nursing home until the public emergency is declared to be over, unless the space is mobile and is temporarily moved off-site for the purposes of directly transporting dead bodies for autopsy or final disposition.  Emergency morgue space is to be deployed, in accordance with these requirements, regardless of whether the nursing home has adopted a long-term plan for the temporary on-site storage of dead bodies, as provided by the bill; however, any emergency morgue space deployed before a plan is adopted will need to be reevaluated by the nursing home at the time of the plans approval or conditional approval and modified as necessary to comply with the provisions of the approved or conditionally approved plan. The long-term cold storage plan developed by a nursing home under the bill is to be used to guide the nursing homes ongoing temporary storage of dead bodies during non-emergent periods and times of public emergency.  The long-term plan is to: 1)    provide for the establishment of, or designate an existing area of the nursing home as, a permanent morgue.  If the nursing home does not currently have a room or other area that can be designated and used as a permanent morgue, the plan is to describe how the nursing home will satisfy the bills requirements, whether through the construction of a new building, the construction of an addition to an existing building, the modification of an existing room or building, or the ongoing and uninterrupted use of a refrigerated vehicle or other mobile cold storage unit as authorized by the bill; and 2)    describe, and identify the current location of, any emergency morgue space that has been designated, established, acquired, or contracted for use during public emergencies pursuant to the bills provisions; identify the third-party provider, if any, who will provide or who is currently providing the emergency morgue space; and describe the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by the nursing home and any contracted third-party provider to ensure that the supplemental emergency morgue space is deployed, remains in service, and is removed from service in accordance with the timeframes specified by the bill. A permanent morgue established under the bill is to be capable of safely, humanely, and simultaneously storing the dead bodies of at least two of the nursing homes patients or residents. The size of any emergency morgue space is to be determined based on the individual needs of the nursing home, but is to be sufficient to ensure the safe and humane temporary storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die at the nursing home during times of public emergency.  If, at any time during a public emergency, a nursing homes emergency morgue space becomes insufficient to safely and humanely store the dead bodies of patients or residents who have died during the public emergency, the nursing home will be required to make every reasonable effort to promptly expand its emergency morgue space as necessary to ensure that its emergency morgue capacity is sufficient for its needs. The nursing homes long-term cold storage plan is to identify the maximum number of dead bodies and the percentage of the nursing homes total patient or resident capacity that can be safely, humanely, and simultaneously stored within the confines of the nursing homes permanent morgue and within the confines of the nursing homes emergency morgue space, and is to further describe the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by the nursing home to ensure that its emergency morgue space remains sufficient for its needs. The long-term plan would additionally be required to identify the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by nursing home administrators and staff to ensure:  1) that dead bodies are handled, stored, and transferred in a safe, sanitary, respectful, and humane way, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; 2) that each dead body is properly identified at the time of placement into cold storage, throughout the duration of the time kept in cold storage, and at the time of the bodys transport out of cold storage; and 3) that each dead body is kept in cold storage for as short a time as is necessary before being safely and humanely transferred to other parties for the purposes of autopsy or final disposition. A permanent morgue or emergency morgue space operating on the grounds of a nursing home may not be used for any purpose other than the storage of the dead bodies of the nursing homes patients or residents.  The facility will not be deemed to be a public morgue, and will not be required to accept the dead bodies of any persons who are not patients or residents of the nursing home. The bill would require the Commissioner of Health to adopt rules and regulations, on an emergency basis, to implement the bills provisions.  The rules and regulations are to be adopted within 30 days after the bills enactment, notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary. A nursing home operating in the State on the effective date of this bill will be required to prepare and submit its long-term plan to the department, as soon as is practicable, but not more than 30 days, after the bills effective date, regardless of whether emergency rules and regulations have been adopted pursuant to the bills provisions.  A nursing home commencing operations in the State after the bills effective date will be required to prepare and submit its long-term plan to the department as part of its application for licensure as a long-term care facility or skilled nursing care provider.  The plan is to be revised and reapproved following the commissioners adoption of emergency rules and regulations, if those rules and regulations were not adopted at the time of the plans initial submission, and also on at least a biennial basis after the plan is initially approved or conditionally approved.  Any revised plan is to be submitted to the department within 10 days after material changes are made thereto. The department will be required to review an initial or revised plan submitted pursuant to the bill and approve or conditionally approve the plan either within 30 days after receipt thereof or, if the plan is submitted as part of an application for licensure, upon the departments issuance of a license to the applicant.  If the plan is conditionally approved, the nursing home will be required to adopt and implement the plan in accordance with any mandatory revisions identified by the department.  If the department does not respond to the submission, the plan will be deemed approved on a non-conditional basis, and the nursing home may proceed to implement the plan without change. A nursing home will be required to ensure that its permanent morgue is fully constructed or otherwise made functional, and is placed into service in accordance with the nursing homes plan, within one year after the plan is approved or conditionally approved or within any extended period of time, as authorized by the commissioner, which may be necessary to ensure proper construction of the permanent morgue.  Any request for an extension of the 180-day statutorily mandated timeframe is to be submitted by the nursing home as an addendum to its initial plan; however, a nursing home will not be eligible for an extension of time if it is planning to use a mobile morgue space as a permanent morgue. Any area used as a permanent morgue and any vehicle, cold storage unit, or other makeshift area used as emergency morgue space under the bill is to:  1) be located on, or immediately adjacent to, the premises of the nursing home at all times during use, except that a mobile morgue space may be temporarily moved off-site when transporting dead bodies for autopsy or final disposition; 2) be closed-off and isolated from public view and removed, to the greatest extent practicable, from patient or resident living quarters and common areas; 3) be fully refrigerated or contain refrigeration or freezer drawers or other cold storage areas where dead bodies will be stored; 4) be of suitable construction, contain appropriate equipment, and be of sufficient size, as provided by the bill, to ensure the lawful, safe, respectful, and humane handling and storage of dead bodies; 5) have lockable doors; 6) be equipped with alarms to signal intrusion and unacceptable temperature variations; 7) have surfaces and flooring constructed of nonporous materials; and 8) be equipped with a working sink or other hand sanitizing station. The bill would prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, and the application of cosmetics or contact lenses in any permanent morgue or emergency morgue space, and it would require personal protective equipment (PPE) to be worn by staff while handling dead bodies for the bills purposes. The bill would require a nursing home to ensure that each dead body is transferred to another party for the purposes of autopsy or final disposition, during non-emergent periods, as soon as possible, but not more than five days, after the body is placed into cold storage or, if a public emergency is ongoing or is declared while the body is in storage, as soon as may be practicable in the context of the public emergency.  When moving a dead body into or out of cold storage, the nursing home is to ensure that the dead body:  1) is placed in a secure, closed container or is otherwise isolated from public view; and 2) is moved in a manner, and using equipment, that protects the health and wellbeing of the other patients or residents of the nursing home, and of nursing home staff, to the greatest extent practicable. The bill also requires a nursing home to maintain certain records in association with is storage and transfer of dead bodies under the bill, and it authorizes the commissioner to: 1) inspect permanent morgues and emergency morgue spaces; 2) investigate complaints about the maltreatment or inappropriate storage of dead bodies by nursing homes; 3) order nursing homes to cease and desist unlawful activities and undertake corrective actions; and 4) seek injunctive relief and recover civil monetary penalties in association with any violation of the commissioners orders.  Any nursing home that fails to comply with an order of the commissioner will be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for a first offense and not more than $5,000 for a second or subsequent offense, to be collected in a summary proceeding.

(3)   A nursing home shall not be eligible for an extension of time under this subsection if it is planning to use a mobile morgue space as a permanent morgue, as provided by subsection c. of section 2 of this act. 4.    a.  Any area used as a permanent morgue and any vehicle, mobile cold storage unit, or other makeshift facility or area used as emergency morgue space for the purposes of this act shall: (1)   be located on, or immediately adjacent to, the premises of the nursing home at all times during use under this act, except that a mobile morgue space may be temporarily removed from the premises of the nursing home for the purposes of directly transporting a dead body for autopsy or final disposition; (2)   be closed-off and isolated from public view and removed, to the greatest extent practicable, from patient or resident living quarters and common areas; (3)   be fully refrigerated or contain refrigeration or freezer drawers or other cold storage areas where dead bodies will be stored; (4)   be of suitable construction, contain appropriate equipment, and be of sufficient size, as provided by subsection b. of this section, to ensure the lawful, safe, respectful, and humane handling and storage of the dead bodies of nursing home patients or residents; (5)   have lockable doors to ensure that access is limited to only those individuals who are directly involved in the transport of dead bodies to or from, or the sanitation of, the permanent morgue or emergency morgue space; (6)   be equipped with alarms to signal intrusion and unacceptable temperature variations; (7)   have surfaces and flooring constructed of nonporous materials that may be easily cleaned and disinfected; and (8)   be equipped with a working sink or other hand sanitizing station. b.    (1)  A permanent morgue established and used pursuant to this act shall be capable of safely, humanely, and simultaneously storing the dead bodies of at least two of the nursing homes patients or residents. (2)   The size of any emergency morgue space used under this act shall be determined based on the individual needs of the nursing home, but shall be sufficient to ensure the safe and humane temporary storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die at the nursing home during times of public emergency.  If, at any time during a public emergency, a nursing homes emergency morgue space becomes insufficient to safely and humanely store the dead bodies of patients or residents who have died during the public emergency, the nursing home shall make every reasonable effort to promptly expand its emergency morgue space as necessary to ensure that the provisions of this paragraph are satisfied. c.     Eating, drinking, smoking, and the application of cosmetics or contact lenses shall not be permitted in any permanent morgue or emergency morgue space. d.    Gloves, masks, medical coats or gowns, and other appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) shall be worn by staff while handling dead bodies for the purposes of this act and shall be sufficient to protect against the transmission of disease and exposure to toxic substances, to the greatest extent practicable.  Such protective clothing and accessories shall be disposed of in an appropriate receptacle or cleaned in accordance with the manufacturers specified guidelines immediately after use. e.     A permanent morgue or emergency morgue space operating on the premises of a nursing home pursuant to this act shall not be used for any purpose other than the storage of the dead bodies of the nursing homes patients or residents.  Such facility shall not be deemed to be a public morgue and shall not be required to accept or store the dead bodies of any persons who are not patients or residents of the nursing home. 5.    a.  A nursing home shall ensure that each dead body placed in cold storage pursuant to this act is transferred to another party for the purposes of autopsy or final disposition, as appropriate, in accordance with the following timeframes: (1)   during non-emergent periods, as soon as may be practicable, but not more than five days, after being placed into cold storage; or (2)   if a public emergency is ongoing or is declared while the body is in storage, as soon as may be practicable in the context of the public emergency. b.    The handling and transfer of dead bodies pursuant to this act shall be done safely, respectfully, humanely, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. c.     In effectuating the transfer of a dead body to or from cold storage pursuant to this act, the nursing home shall ensure that the dead body: (1)   is placed in a secure, closed container or is otherwise isolated from public view; and (2)   is moved in and out of cold storage in a manner, and using equipment, that protects the health and wellbeing of the other patients or residents of the nursing home, and of nursing home staff, to the greatest extent practicable. 6.    a.  In addition to any other records required by law, a nursing home shall maintain complete and accurate records of its storage and transfer of dead bodies pursuant to this act.  Such records shall be maintained for a period of five years. b.    The records maintained pursuant to this section shall include: (1)   a death certificate or other documentation showing the declared date and time of death and, to the extent known, the cause of death for each dead body placed in cold storage;

STATEMENT This bill would require each nursing home in the State, in compliance with a long-term plan adopted pursuant to the bills provisions, to:  1) designate or establish a permanent morgue for the storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die during non-emergent times; and 2) designate, establish, acquire, or contract with a third-party to provide a refrigerated vehicle, mobile cold storage unit, or other makeshift facility or area, or a combination thereof, for use by the nursing home as supplemental emergency morgue space in times of public emergency. The bill would require emergency morgue space to be deployed on the premises of the nursing home and placed into service within 72 hours after the declaration of any public emergency or, if a public emergency is ongoing on the effective date of this bill, within 72 hours after this bills effective date.  The emergency morgue space is to remain in service on the premises of the nursing home until the public emergency is declared to be over, unless the space is mobile and is temporarily moved off-site for the purposes of directly transporting dead bodies for autopsy or final disposition.  Emergency morgue space is to be deployed, in accordance with these requirements, regardless of whether the nursing home has adopted a long-term plan for the temporary on-site storage of dead bodies, as provided by the bill; however, any emergency morgue space deployed before a plan is adopted will need to be reevaluated by the nursing home at the time of the plans approval or conditional approval and modified as necessary to comply with the provisions of the approved or conditionally approved plan. The long-term cold storage plan developed by a nursing home under the bill is to be used to guide the nursing homes ongoing temporary storage of dead bodies during non-emergent periods and times of public emergency.  The long-term plan is to: 1)    provide for the establishment of, or designate an existing area of the nursing home as, a permanent morgue.  If the nursing home does not currently have a room or other area that can be designated and used as a permanent morgue, the plan is to describe how the nursing home will satisfy the bills requirements, whether through the construction of a new building, the construction of an addition to an existing building, the modification of an existing room or building, or the ongoing and uninterrupted use of a refrigerated vehicle or other mobile cold storage unit as authorized by the bill; and 2)    describe, and identify the current location of, any emergency morgue space that has been designated, established, acquired, or contracted for use during public emergencies pursuant to the bills provisions; identify the third-party provider, if any, who will provide or who is currently providing the emergency morgue space; and describe the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by the nursing home and any contracted third-party provider to ensure that the supplemental emergency morgue space is deployed, remains in service, and is removed from service in accordance with the timeframes specified by the bill. A permanent morgue established under the bill is to be capable of safely, humanely, and simultaneously storing the dead bodies of at least two of the nursing homes patients or residents. The size of any emergency morgue space is to be determined based on the individual needs of the nursing home, but is to be sufficient to ensure the safe and humane temporary storage of the dead bodies of patients or residents who die at the nursing home during times of public emergency.  If, at any time during a public emergency, a nursing homes emergency morgue space becomes insufficient to safely and humanely store the dead bodies of patients or residents who have died during the public emergency, the nursing home will be required to make every reasonable effort to promptly expand its emergency morgue space as necessary to ensure that its emergency morgue capacity is sufficient for its needs. The nursing homes long-term cold storage plan is to identify the maximum number of dead bodies and the percentage of the nursing homes total patient or resident capacity that can be safely, humanely, and simultaneously stored within the confines of the nursing homes permanent morgue and within the confines of the nursing homes emergency morgue space, and is to further describe the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by the nursing home to ensure that its emergency morgue space remains sufficient for its needs. The long-term plan would additionally be required to identify the means, methods, and procedures that will be used by nursing home administrators and staff to ensure:  1) that dead bodies are handled, stored, and transferred in a safe, sanitary, respectful, and humane way, in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; 2) that each dead body is properly identified at the time of placement into cold storage, throughout the duration of the time kept in cold storage, and at the time of the bodys transport out of cold storage; and 3) that each dead body is kept in cold storage for as short a time as is necessary before being safely and humanely transferred to other parties for the purposes of autopsy or final disposition. A permanent morgue or emergency morgue space operating on the grounds of a nursing home may not be used for any purpose other than the storage of the dead bodies of the nursing homes patients or residents.  The facility will not be deemed to be a public morgue, and will not be required to accept the dead bodies of any persons who are not patients or residents of the nursing home. The bill would require the Commissioner of Health to adopt rules and regulations, on an emergency basis, to implement the bills provisions.  The rules and regulations are to be adopted within 30 days after the bills enactment, notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary. A nursing home operating in the State on the effective date of this bill will be required to prepare and submit its long-term plan to the department, as soon as is practicable, but not more than 30 days, after the bills effective date, regardless of whether emergency rules and regulations have been adopted pursuant to the bills provisions.  A nursing home commencing operations in the State after the bills effective date will be required to prepare and submit its long-term plan to the department as part of its application for licensure as a long-term care facility or skilled nursing care provider.  The plan is to be revised and reapproved following the commissioners adoption of emergency rules and regulations, if those rules and regulations were not adopted at the time of the plans initial submission, and also on at least a biennial basis after the plan is initially approved or conditionally approved.  Any revised plan is to be submitted to the department within 10 days after material changes are made thereto. The department will be required to review an initial or revised plan submitted pursuant to the bill and approve or conditionally approve the plan either within 30 days after receipt thereof or, if the plan is submitted as part of an application for licensure, upon the departments issuance of a license to the applicant.  If the plan is conditionally approved, the nursing home will be required to adopt and implement the plan in accordance with any mandatory revisions identified by the department.  If the department does not respond to the submission, the plan will be deemed approved on a non-conditional basis, and the nursing home may proceed to implement the plan without change. A nursing home will be required to ensure that its permanent morgue is fully constructed or otherwise made functional, and is placed into service in accordance with the nursing homes plan, within one year after the plan is approved or conditionally approved or within any extended period of time, as authorized by the commissioner, which may be necessary to ensure proper construction of the permanent morgue.  Any request for an extension of the 180-day statutorily mandated timeframe is to be submitted by the nursing home as an addendum to its initial plan; however, a nursing home will not be eligible for an extension of time if it is planning to use a mobile morgue space as a permanent morgue. Any area used as a permanent morgue and any vehicle, cold storage unit, or other makeshift area used as emergency morgue space under the bill is to:  1) be located on, or immediately adjacent to, the premises of the nursing home at all times during use, except that a mobile morgue space may be temporarily moved off-site when transporting dead bodies for autopsy or final disposition; 2) be closed-off and isolated from public view and removed, to the greatest extent practicable, from patient or resident living quarters and common areas; 3) be fully refrigerated or contain refrigeration or freezer drawers or other cold storage areas where dead bodies will be stored; 4) be of suitable construction, contain appropriate equipment, and be of sufficient size, as provided by the bill, to ensure the lawful, safe, respectful, and humane handling and storage of dead bodies; 5) have lockable doors; 6) be equipped with alarms to signal intrusion and unacceptable temperature variations; 7) have surfaces and flooring constructed of nonporous materials; and 8) be equipped with a working sink or other hand sanitizing station. The bill would prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, and the application of cosmetics or contact lenses in any permanent morgue or emergency morgue space, and it would require personal protective equipment (PPE) to be worn by staff while handling dead bodies for the bills purposes. The bill would require a nursing home to ensure that each dead body is transferred to another party for the purposes of autopsy or final disposition, during non-emergent periods, as soon as possible, but not more than five days, after the body is placed into cold storage or, if a public emergency is ongoing or is declared while the body is in storage, as soon as may be practicable in the context of the public emergency.  When moving a dead body into or out of cold storage, the nursing home is to ensure that the dead body:  1) is placed in a secure, closed container or is otherwise isolated from public view; and 2) is moved in a manner, and using equipment, that protects the health and wellbeing of the other patients or residents of the nursing home, and of nursing home staff, to the greatest extent practicable. The bill also requires a nursing home to maintain certain records in association with is storage and transfer of dead bodies under the bill, and it authorizes the commissioner to: 1) inspect permanent morgues and emergency morgue spaces; 2) investigate complaints about the maltreatment or inappropriate storage of dead bodies by nursing homes; 3) order nursing homes to cease and desist unlawful activities and undertake corrective actions; and 4) seek injunctive relief and recover civil monetary penalties in association with any violation of the commissioners orders.  Any nursing home that fails to comply with an order of the commissioner will be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $1,000 for a first offense and not more than $5,000 for a second or subsequent offense, to be collected in a summary proceeding.
