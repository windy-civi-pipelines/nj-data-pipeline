The task force will dissolve upon submission of its report. Reports suggest that some types of polyurethane flooring commonly used in school buildings, including in multipurpose rooms, gyms, cafeterias, auditoriums, stages, and indoor and outdoor tracks, contains a chemical that releases odorless, colorless mercury vapor, which can damage the nervous system, kidneys, lungs, eyes, and skin, and may be particularly harmful to the development of young children.  It is the sponsors intent that New Jersey develop appropriate strategies to detect and remediate mercury hazards in schools and child care centers.
