<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Act in furtherance of
the right of advocacy on issues of public interest means:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a written or oral
statement made in connection with an issue of public interest in, under
consideration or review by, or that is reasonably likely to encourage or to
enlist public participation in an effort to effect consideration or review by,
a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any other State or local
government proceeding authorized by law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   an expression or
expressive conduct that involves petitioning State or local government or
communicating views to members of the public in connection with an issue of
public interest; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   any written or oral
statement made or submitted in a place open to the public or a public forum in
connection with an issue of public concern; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   any other conduct in
furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech or right
of petition in connection with an issue of public interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Issue of public
interest means an issue related to: health or safety; environmental, economic,
or community well-being; the government; a public figure; or a good, product,
or service in the marketplace. Issue of public interest shall not be
construed to include private interests, such as statements directed primarily
toward protecting the speakers commercial interests rather than toward
commenting on or sharing information about a matter of public significance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Governmental entity
includes any branch, department, agency, instrumentality, official, employee,

Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Person means an
individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, limited
liability company, association, joint venture, or any other legal or commercial
entity, except that the term does not include any individual or agency acting
on behalf of a governmental entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Responding party
means a person who is the plaintiff in an alleged SLAPP lawsuit and against
whom a moving party has filed an application seeking dismissal of the lawsuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    SLAPP lawsuit means a
Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, which is a civil action
intended to deter or suppress the desire of any citizen to act in furtherance
of the right of advocacy on issues of public interest. While sometimes
difficult to identify, these lawsuits often take the forms of lawsuits for
defamation, tortious interference with business or contract, civil conspiracy
or abuse of process, constitutional or civil rights violations, or nuisance,
and similar causes of action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    SLAPP-back lawsuit is
a civil action in which the moving party seeks compensatory damages based on a
claim such as frivolous litigation, malicious use of process, or other process
authorized by law in response to a SLAPP lawsuit that has been dismissed in
favor of the moving party pursuant to the provisions of P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or other process
authorized by the Rules of Court. </p>

requirements within the Rules of Court regarding the effect of a signature on
pleadings, the signature of a party or attorney on any pleading submitted to
the court in a civil action shall constitute a certification that the signatory
has read the pleading and certifies that, to the best of the persons or
attorneys knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry
under the circumstances, that the pleading is not being presented for any
improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay in judicial
proceedings or to cause needless increase in the cost of litigation with the
purpose of suppressing another persons act in furtherance of the right of
advocacy on issues of public interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If, at any time during a
civil proceeding, the court finds that a pleading was signed with willful
intent to suppress a persons act in furtherance of the right of advocacy on
issues of public interest, the court may strike the pleading, dismiss the civil
action, or grant other relief as provided by the Rules of Court or by law, which
may include an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the opposing
party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    Application to Dismiss
SLAPP Lawsuit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A moving party may file
an application with the court seeking dismissal of a civil action on the basis
that it is a SLAPP lawsuit. The application shall be filed and the pleadings
served in accordance with the Rules of Court. To the extent possible, the court
shall give expedited calendar preference to an application for dismissal filed
under this section to promote prompt disposition of the issues raised in the
application to prevent the unnecessary expense of protracted litigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Upon the filing of an
application for dismissal of a SLAPP lawsuit pursuant to this section, the
court shall stay all discovery and any pending proceedings in the civil action.
The stay shall remain in effect until the entry of judgment on the application
for dismissal. Notwithstanding a stay imposed by this subsection, the court, on
request of a party for good cause shown, may order that specified discovery or
other proceedings be conducted if necessary to allow the parties to meet or
oppose the burden of proof established in subsection c. of this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, good cause shall include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   whether the party
seeking discovery has reasonably identified specific material held or known by
the opposing party that would aid the party seeking discovery in meeting or
opposing the burden of proof established in subsection c. of this section;             </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   whether the specific
materials sought in discovery are available from a source other than the
opposing party; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   other relevant factors
at the courts discretion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A moving party filing
an application pursuant to subsection a. of this section has the initial burden
of presenting prima facie evidence showing that the cause of action at issue
arises from an act in furtherance of the right of advocacy on an issue of
public interest.  If the moving party meets this requirement, the burden shifts
to the responding party to establish the existence of prima facie evidence that
demonstrates the probability of prevailing on the cause of action, including
evidence to support each essential element of the cause of action, evidence
showing that the moving partys application for dismissal based on an act in
furtherance of the right of advocacy on issues of public interest is devoid of
any reasonable factual support or any arguable basis of law, and evidence
showing that the moving partys acts caused actual compensable harm to the
responding party. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After considering pleadings
and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts on which the liability
or defense is based, the court shall determine whether the responding party has
established the existence of prima facie evidence that demonstrates the
probability of prevailing on the cause of action which requires that the civil
action proceed to trial.  If the court finds that the responding party has met
this burden, the application for dismissal shall be denied and the civil action
shall proceed to trial at the discretion of the court; otherwise, the civil
action shall be dismissed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    If the court denies an
application for dismissal pursuant to this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the fact that the
determination has been made and the substance of the determination shall not be
admitted into evidence at any subsequent proceeding; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the determination shall
not affect the burden of proof or standard of proof that is applied during any
subsequent proceeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1)  The court shall
award a moving party who prevails on an application for dismissal of the SLAPP
lawsuit reasonable costs of litigation and any attorneys fees incurred in
defending the SLAPP lawsuit. In addition, the court may order additional relief
including sanctions against the responding party as the court deems necessary
to deter repetition of comparable conduct by the responding party or others
similarly situated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   If the court finds that
the application for dismissal of the SLAPP lawsuit was frivolous or that it was
solely intended to cause unnecessary delay, the court shall award the
responding party reasonable costs of litigation and attorneys fees related to
the opposition of the application for dismissal of the SLAPP lawsuit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Unless the right to
judgment is waived by the moving party, reasonable attorney fees and costs in
connection with the application for dismissal of the SLAPP lawsuit shall be
awarded, as appropriate, notwithstanding the fact that the responding party
requested the dismissal of the civil action subsequent to the filing of the
moving partys application for dismissal, but prior to the issuance of the
judgment of dismissal by the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     A party aggrieved by
the trial courts decision regarding an application to dismiss a civil action alleged
to be a SLAPP lawsuit may appeal that decision pursuant to the Rules of Court.
To the extent possible, the court shall give calendar preference to an appeal
of a dismissal of a civil action determined to be a SLAPP lawsuit.  In any
appeal of a dismissal pursuant to this act, the court may award reasonable
attorney fees and costs of litigation to the prevailing party.</p>

Notwithstanding the stay, the court, on request of a party for good cause
