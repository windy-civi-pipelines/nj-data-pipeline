ACR67 ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 67 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) Assemblyman  SEAN T. KEAN District 30 (Monmouth and Ocean) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Dunn, Matsikoudis, Assemblyman Karabinchak, Assemblywomen Drulis, Flynn and Assemblyman Scharfenberger SYNOPSIS Condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Concurrent Resolution condemning all forms of anti-Semitism and rejecting attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred. Whereas, All Americans have a stake in fighting anti-Semitism, as all Americans have a stake in fighting every form of bigotry and hatred against people based on religion, race, or place of birth and origin; and Whereas, Anti-Semitism is the centuries-old bigotry and form of racism faced by Jewish people simply because they are Jews; and Whereas, Anti-Semitism includes blaming Jewish people when things go wrong, calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jewish people in the name of a radical ideology or extremist view of religion, or making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotyped allegations about Jewish people; and Whereas, Jewish people are subjected in the media and political campaigns to dangerous anti-Semitic myths as well, including that Jews control the United States government or seek global, political, and financial domination; and Whereas, Accusing Jews of being more loyal to Israel or to the Jewish community than to the United States constitutes anti-Semitism because it suggests that Jewish citizens cannot be patriotic Americans and trusted neighbors, when Jews have loyally served our nation every day since its founding, whether in public or community life or military service; and Whereas, Scapegoating and targeting of Jews in the United States has persisted for many years, including by the Ku Klux Klan, the America First Committee, and modern neo-Nazis; and Whereas, There is clear evidence of increasing incidents and expressions of anti-Semitism throughout the world; and Whereas, A May 2014 survey by the Anti-Defamation League, The ADL Global 100: An Index of Anti-Semitism, which surveyed people in over 100 countries about their attitudes toward Jewish people, found that a majority of people surveyed overall have either not heard of the Holocaust or do not believe it happened as has been documented by factual accounts and recorded by historians; and Whereas, The January 2015 terrorist massacre of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris, the subsequent killing of four French Jews at a kosher market just hours before the Jewish Sabbath, the closing of Paris Grande Synagogue for the first time since World War II, the closing of Jewish schools in Belgium and other European nations, and the fears of ongoing anti-Semitism in Europes largest Jewish communities demonstrated to Jews and all people everywhere that Jewish life in France, Europe and throughout the world is difficult and uncertain in the face of growing anti-Semitic hatred and violence; and Whereas, On August 11 and 12, 2017, self-identified neo-Confederates, white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and Ku Klux Klansmen held white supremacist events in Charlottesville, Virginia, where they marched on a synagogue under the Nazi swastika, engaged in racist and anti-Semitic demonstrations, and committed brutal and deadly violence against peaceful Americans; and Whereas, In 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported a 37 percent increase in hate crimes against Jews or Jewish institutions and found that attacks against Jews or Jewish institutions made up 58.1 percent of all religious-based hate crimes; and Whereas, A 2018 report from the Anti-Defamation League noted that in 2018 there were 1,879 anti-Semitic incidents against Jews and Jewish institutions; and Whereas, On October 27, 2018, the perpetrator of the deadliest attack on Jewish people in the history of the United States killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and reportedly stated that he wanted all Jews to die; and Whereas, New Jersey ranked third in the nation in anti-Semitic incidents in 2018, with 200 anti-Semitic incidents reported; and Whereas, In New Jersey, Bergen, Middlesex, Ocean, and Union counties had the largest number of reported anti-Semitic incidents in 2018 at 36, 23, 21, and 19, respectively; and Whereas, In 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported an increase in hate crimes against Jews or Jewish institutions and found that attacks against Jews or Jewish institutions made up 60.3 percent of all religious-based hate crimes; and Whereas, There is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities, and synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions; and Whereas, Anti-Semitism is a challenge to the basic principles of tolerance, pluralism, and democracy and the shared values that bind Americans together; and Whereas, The First Amendment to the Constitution established the United States as a country committed to the principles of tolerance and religious freedom, and the Fourteenth Amendment established equal protection of the laws as the heart of justice in the United States; and Whereas, Adherence to these principles is vital to the progress of the American people and the diverse communities and religious groups of the State of New Jersey; and Whereas, Prejudice against Jewish people as a national, ethnic, religious, or racial group has no place in New Jersey or in the United States of America and violates the United States Constitution and the laws of the United States; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.  The New Jersey Legislature unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects attempts in this State, the United States, and throughout the world to justify anti-Jewish hatred. 2.  The New Jersey Legislature applauds the leaders in the United States and those foreign leaders who have condemned anti-Semitic acts and calls on those who have yet to take firm action against anti-Semitism in their countries to do so. 3.  The New Jersey Legislature supports expanded Holocaust education programs that increase awareness, counter prejudice, and enhance efforts to teach the universal lessons of the Holocaust, genocide, intolerance, and discrimination. 4.  The New Jersey Legislature calls upon the citizens of New Jersey and the States government entities to continue to be vigilant with efforts to prevent and report acts of anti-Semitism, hate crimes and other violations of human rights and religious freedom. 5.  Copies of the resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the President of the United States, the United States Secretary of State, the Governor, and to each member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This resolution condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and rejects attempts to justify anti-Jewish hatred. Throughout the last decade, there has been clear evidence of increasing incidents and expressions of anti-Semitism throughout the world. More recently, in a 2018 report, the Anti-Defamation League noted that in 2018 there were 1,879 anti-Semitic incidents against Jews and Jewish institutions, which included the deadliest attack on Jewish persons in American history on October 27, 2018 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where 11 worshippers were killed.  In 2018, a report showed New Jersey ranked third in the nation in anti-Semitic incidents with 200 anti-Semitic incidents reported.  In 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported an increase in hate crimes against Jews or Jewish institutions and found that attacks against Jews or Jewish institutions made up 60.3 percent of all religious-based hate crimes. There is an urgent need to ensure the safety and security of Jewish communities, and synagogues, schools, cemeteries, and other institutions.  Anti-Semitism is the centuries-old bigotry and form of racism faced by Jewish people simply because they are Jews.
