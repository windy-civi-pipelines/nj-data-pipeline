A2382 ASSEMBLY, No. 2382 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  WILLIAM W. SPEARMAN District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Assemblywoman  SHAVONDA E. SUMTER District 35 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Carter and Assemblyman Wimberly SYNOPSIS Establishes Community Crisis Response Advisory Council and community crisis response teams pilot program; appropriates $10 million. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning community crisis response and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jerseys system of policing and incarceration has staggering racial disparities. b.    Since 2015, fatal police encounters in New Jersey have resulted in the deaths at least 86 members of the public. Almost half, or 48 percent, of those who lost their lives were Black. c.     New Jersey has one of the highest racial disparities among victims of police violence in the country: Black New Jersey residents are killed at a rate 8.3 times higher than white residents. d.    Between October of 2020 and February of 2021, there have been over 3,500 documented police use-of-force incidents across the State. Of these incidents, at least 46 percent involved police using force on Black individuals. e.     According to studies, individuals with untreated severe mental illness are involved in one-fourth of all fatal police encounters, making those with untreated mental illness 16 times more likely to be killed by a police officer. f.     Over the last few years, 911 calls for mental health crises in New Jersey have increased exponentially. g.    In 2012, New Jersey passed the Overdose Prevention Act, which includes Good Samaritan protections that are intended to encourage people to call 911 if they are with a person who is experiencing an overdose.  Yet, research on the effectiveness of Good Samaritan laws shows that overdose bystanders continue to delay or refrain from calling 911 due to fear of police involvement, social penalties, and stigma. h.    According to national studies, the majority of all police killings in the United States escalate from nonviolent situations, such as traffic stops, mental health checks, and domestic disputes. i.     Current research demonstrates that police-centered models of public safety have far-reaching harms, especially for young Black men. Even in the absence of violence, frequent police stops are linked to adverse mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. j.     Other jurisdictions have found that responding to a variety of calls for service, especially those that involve a mental health crisis, with an alternative crisis response team not only reduces the possibility of escalation and thus, use of force, but also provides monetary savings to the cities implementing these models. k.    Research on the state of policing shows that front-line officers are experiencing physical and mental health challenges related to burnout and the cumulative stress of responding to behavioral health incidents. 2.    As used in this act: Community crisis response team means a team that provides professional on-site community-based intervention such as outreach, de-escalation, stabilization, resource connection, and follow-up support for individuals who are experiencing a behavioral health crisis, that shall include certified peer counselors as a best practice to the extent practicable. Crisis response services mean short-term individualized crisis stabilization services which follow a crisis screening or assessment and which are designed to restore the individual to a prior functional level. Community-based organization means a public or private nonprofit organization that is representative of a community or a significant segment of a community, and is engaged in meeting human, educational, environmental, or public safety community needs. Substance use disorders means the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both that causes clinically significant impairment, including health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. Harm reduction services means policies, programs, and practices that aim to reduce or minimize the adverse consequences associated with the use of substances. Law enforcement agency means a State, county or municipal law enforcement agency, department, division, or instrumentality thereof that is statutorily empowered to act for the detection, investigation, arrest, conviction, detention, or rehabilitation of persons violating the criminal laws of the State. Behavioral health means mental health, substance abuse, or co-occurring mental health and substance abuse diagnoses, and the continuum of mental health, substance abuse, or co-occurring mental health and substance abuse treatment. 3.   a. There is established in the Department of Health the Community Crisis Response Advisory Council to provide the department with best practices and recommendations concerning the development of a community crisis response program in the form of an annual report to the department.  Upon submission to the council, the report immediately shall be made available to the public. b.   The council shall consist of 13 members, as follows: (1) the Deputy Commissioner of Public Health Services the Assistant Commissioner of the Division of HIV, STD and TB Services, and the Director of Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health, or their designees, who shall serve ex officio; (2) the Attorney General or a designee, who shall serve ex officio; (3) the Executive Director of the Division of Violence Intervention and Victim Assistance in the Department of Law and Public Safety, or a designee, serving ex officio; (4) the Director of the Division of Fire Safety in the Department of Community Affairs, or a designee, serving ex officio;  and (5) seven public members of the council who shall be appointed by the Governor, with two members appointed upon recommendation of the Senate President and two members appointed upon recommendation of the Speaker of the General Assembly. c.   The seven public members shall consist of one or more members: who have prior involvement with the criminal justice system; who have expertise in crisis response, harm reduction services, or both; who have experience advocating for their communities; and who represent New Jersey-based social justice and civil rights organizations specializing in criminal justice reform. d.   The Deputy Commissioner of Public Health Services shall serve as chairperson of the council.  The members of the council shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for the reasonable expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the council for its purposes. e.   The council first shall organize not later than 45 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill.  The council shall meet periodically at the call of the chairperson, but not less than six times in each calendar year.  A majority of the members of the council shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of the council taking official action, but a lesser number may hold public hearings.  All meetings of the council shall be open to the public.  Agendas, minutes, documents, and testimony from each meeting shall be posted on the Internet website of the Department of Health. f.    Public members of the council shall serve for a term of three years.  Vacancies in the membership shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointments were made.  Public members shall be eligible for reappointment to the advisory council. g.   The council shall be entitled to receive assistance and services from any State, county, or municipal department, board, commission, or agency, as may be available to it for its purposes.  The Department of Health shall provide staff and administrative support to the council. h.   The council shall hold public hearings throughout the State, at which it may ask individuals to testify who can provide insight into the need, design, and effectiveness of community-based crisis intervention. 4.   a.

To be eligible to receive a grant pursuant to the pilot program: (1)  a municipality is required to be a municipality of the first class in Essex and Passaic Counties, a municipality of the second class having a population of more than 70,000 and density of 8,000 to 12,000 according to the 2020 federal decennial census in Camden and Mercer counties, and a municipality of the second class having a population of more than 55,000 and density of between 10,000 and 11,000 according to the 2020 federal decennial census in Middlesex County; and (2)  a community-based organization is required to be located in a municipality that meets the eligibility criteria. Additionally, an applicant is required to demonstrate an established relationship with a State-approved harm reduction center or reliable access to other harm reduction services. The department would be required to prioritize issuing grants to applicants that currently operate as violence interrupters and have a demonstrated process for engaging members of the community and receiving public comments with respect to its community crisis r The bill requires the commissioner to submit an annual report to the Governor and the Legislature on the status of the pilot program. Three years following the date of enactment, the commissioner, in collaboration with the council, would be required to submit a final report to the Governor and the Legislature on the outcomes resulting from the pilot program and recommendations for the actions necessary to support the continuation and expansion of community crisis response models in the State of New Jersey. The bill appropriates $10 million and provides that grants awarded under the pilot program to applicants in each eligible municipality are not to exceed $2 million per municipality.
