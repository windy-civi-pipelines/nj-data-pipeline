c.77, and supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 24 of P.L.1982,
c.77 (C.2A:4A-43) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     24.  Disposition of
delinquency cases. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  In determining the
appropriate disposition for a juvenile adjudicated delinquent the court shall
weigh the following factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The nature and
circumstances of the offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The degree of injury to
persons or damage to property caused by the juvenile's offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The juvenile's age,
previous record, prior social service received, and out-of-home placement
history;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Whether the disposition
supports family strength, responsibility, and unity and the well-being and
physical safety of the juvenile;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Whether the disposition
provides for reasonable participation by the child's parent, guardian, or
custodian, provided, however, that the failure of a parent or parents to
cooperate in the disposition shall not be weighed against the juvenile in
arriving at an appropriate disposition;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Whether the disposition
recognizes and treats the unique physical, psychological, and social
characteristics and needs of the child;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Whether the disposition
contributes to the developmental needs of the child, including the academic and
social needs of the child where the child has intellectual disabilities or
learning disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Any other circumstances
related to the offense and the juvenile's social history as deemed appropriate
by the court;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   The impact of the
offense on the victim or victims;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) The impact of the offense
on the community; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11) The threat to the safety
of the public or any individual posed by the child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If a juvenile is
adjudged delinquent, and except to the extent that an additional specific
disposition is required pursuant to this section, the court, in accordance with
subsection i. of section 2 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-21), may order
incarceration pursuant to section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-44) or the
court may order any one or more of the following dispositions:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Adjourn formal entry of
disposition of the case for a period not to exceed 12 months for the purpose of
determining whether the juvenile makes a satisfactory adjustment, and if during
the period of continuance the juvenile makes such an adjustment, dismiss the
complaint;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Release the juvenile to
the supervision of the juvenile's parent or guardian;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Place the juvenile on
probation to the chief probation officer of the county or to any other suitable
person who agrees to accept the duty of probation supervision for a period not
to exceed three years upon such written conditions as the court deems will aid
rehabilitation of the juvenile;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Transfer custody of the
juvenile to any relative or other person determined by the court to be
qualified to care for the juvenile;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Place the juvenile under
the care and responsibility of the Department of Children and Families so that
the commissioner may designate a division or organizational unit in the
department pursuant to P.L.1951, c.138 (C.30:4C-1 et seq.) for the purpose of
providing services in or out of the home.  Within 14 days, unless for good cause
shown, but not later than 30 days, the Department of Children and Families
shall submit to the court a service plan, which shall be presumed valid,
detailing the specifics of any disposition order.  The plan shall be developed
within the limits of fiscal and other resources available to the department. 
If the court determines that the service plan is inappropriate, given existing
resources, the department may request a hearing on that determination;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Place the juvenile under
the care and custody of the Commissioner of Children and Families for the
purpose of receiving the services of the Division of Children's System of Care
of that department, provided that the juvenile has been determined to be
eligible for those services under P.L.1965, c.59, s.16 <br>
(C.30:4-25.4);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Commit the juvenile,
pursuant to applicable laws and the Rules of Court governing civil commitment,
to the Department of Children and Families under the responsibility of the

court to incarcerate a juvenile shall be made in accordance with subsection i.

juvenile is consistent with the goals of public safety, accountability, and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill increases the
penalties imposed on juveniles and adults convicted of motor vehicle theft and
related crimes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      The bill specifically
provides that a person convicted of a first offense of theft of a motor vehicle
would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 180 days
without eligibility for parole.  A person convicted of a second or subsequent
offense would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one
year without eligibility for parole. The court may also require a person to pay
monetary restitution to any person or entity who has suffered loss resulting
from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of the offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A juvenile adjudicated
delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the
crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor
vehicle (joy riding) and operating it in a manner that creates a risk of injury
or risk of property damage would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of 30
days for a first offense.  For a second offense, the juvenile would be
sentenced to incarceration for a term of 60 days followed by a period of time
in a nonresidential program operated by a public or private agency. For a third
or subsequent offense, the juvenile would be sentenced to incarceration for a
term of six months, followed by a period of time in a nonresidential program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the juvenile has been
adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would
constitute the crime of entering and riding in a motor vehicle knowing that the
motor vehicle has been taken or is being operated without the consent of the
owner, the court would order the juvenile incarcerated for a term of 10 days,
followed by a term of community service for at least 30 days. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the court
may require a juvenile to make restitution to a person or entity who has
suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a
result of the offense for which the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent. 
Under the bill, the court would not be permitted to order a juvenile who has
been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would
constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a
motor vehicle, or joyriding to pay restitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the provisions of the
bill provide that any person who is at least 18 years of age who knowingly
uses, solicits, directs, hires, or employs a person 17 years of age or younger
to commit theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, or
joyriding is to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of
between six months and one year for a first offense, and not less than five
years for a second or subsequent offense.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to New Jersey officials,
as of May 2022 car thefts have increased 37% compared to 2021 and 53% compared
to 2020. There were 14,320 vehicles stolen in New Jersey in 2021. Nationally,
the National Insurance Crime Bureau has reported an unprecedented rise in car
thefts and carjackings in recent years, increasing by 16.5% across the country
in 2021 compared to 2019 and nearly 29% compared to 2017. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the view of the sponsor,
the increasing numbers of car thefts have had many negative impacts on the
community, ranging from an increased fear of crime to the loss of
transportation when a vehicle is stolen and costs for car insurance.</p>
