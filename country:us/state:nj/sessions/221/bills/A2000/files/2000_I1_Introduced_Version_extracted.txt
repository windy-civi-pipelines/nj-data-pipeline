(2)   A juvenile shall not be incarcerated in any county detention facility unless the county has entered into an agreement with the Juvenile Justice Commission concerning the use of the facility for sentenced juveniles.

(4)   If as a result of incarceration of adjudicated juveniles pursuant to this subsection, a county is required to transport a predisposition juvenile to a juvenile detention facility in another county, the costs of such transportation shall be borne by the Juvenile Justice Commission. d.    Whenever the court imposes a disposition upon an adjudicated delinquent which requires the juvenile to perform a community service, restitution, or to participate in any other program provided for in this section other than subsection c., the duration of the juvenile's mandatory participation in such alternative programs shall extend for a period consistent with the program goal for the juvenile and shall in no event exceed one year beyond the maximum duration permissible for the delinquent if the juvenile had been committed to a term of incarceration. e.     In addition to any disposition the court may impose pursuant to this section or section 25 of P.L.1982, c.77 (C.2A:4A-44), the following orders shall be included in dispositions of the adjudications set forth below: (1)   An order to [perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 60 days]: (a)  incarcerate the juvenile for a term of 30 days, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10[, or the third degree crime of eluding in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:29-2] ; (b)  an order to incarcerate the juvenile for a term of 60 days and, following the term of incarceration, place the juvenile in a nonresidential program operated by a public or private agency pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (16) of subsection b. of this section for a length of time specified by the court, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for a second violation of an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10; (c)  an order to incarcerate the juvenile for a term of six months and, following the term of incarceration, place the juvenile in a nonresidential program operated by a public or private agency pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (16) of subsection b. of this section for a length of time specified by the court, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for a third or subsequent violation of an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10; (d)  an order to incarcerate the juvenile for a term of 10 days and, following the term of incarceration, perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 30 days if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of entering and riding in a motor vehicle knowing that the motor vehicle has been taken or is being operated without the consent of the owner in violation of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:20-10; or (e)  an order to perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 60 days if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the third degree crime of eluding in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:29-2; and (2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (3)   [An order to perform community service pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection b. of this section for a period of at least 30 days, if the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the fourth degree crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-10.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (4)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) f.  (1)  (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (2)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) (3)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2019, c.363) g.    Whenever the court imposes a disposition upon an adjudicated delinquent which requires the juvenile to perform a community service, restitution, or to participate in any other program provided for in this section, the order shall include provisions which provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, accountability for offenses committed, fostering interaction and dialogue between the offender, victim, and community and the development of competencies to enable the child to become a responsible and productive member of the community. (cf: P.L.2021, c.342, s.1) 2.  (New section)  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1 or any other law, and in addition to any other disposition a person convicted of theft of a motor vehicle pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-2 shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 180 days, during which the person shall be ineligible for parole.  A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year, during which the person shall be ineligible for parole. b.    In addition to any other penalty imposed by the court, a person convicted of theft of a motor vehicle pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-2 may be required to pay monetary restitution to any person or entity who has suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of that offense.  The court may determine the reasonable amount, terms, and conditions of restitution. 3.    (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:44-1 or any other law, and in addition to any other disposition, any person being at least 18 years of age who knowingly uses, solicits, directs, hires, or employs a person 17 years of age or younger to commit theft of a motor vehicle pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-2; the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle in violation of subsection b. or c. of N.J.S.2C:20-10; or entering and riding in a motor vehicle knowing that the motor vehicle has been taken or is being operated without the consent of the owner in violation of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:20-10 shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which shall include the imposition of a minimum term of not less than six months and not greater than one year for a first offense, and not less than five years for a second or subsequent offense.  It shall be no defense to a prosecution under this section that the person mistakenly believed that the person which the actor used, solicited, directed, hired or employed was 18 years of age or older, even if such mistaken belief was reasonable. 4.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill increases the penalties imposed on juveniles and adults convicted of motor vehicle theft and related crimes. The bill specifically provides that a person convicted of a first offense of theft of a motor vehicle would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 180 days without eligibility for parole.  A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year without eligibility for parole. The court may also require a person to pay monetary restitution to any person or entity who has suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of the offense. A juvenile adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle (joy riding) and operating it in a manner that creates a risk of injury or risk of property damage would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of 30 days for a first offense.  For a second offense, the juvenile would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of 60 days followed by a period of time in a nonresidential program operated by a public or private agency. For a third or subsequent offense, the juvenile would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of six months, followed by a period of time in a nonresidential program. If the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of entering and riding in a motor vehicle knowing that the motor vehicle has been taken or is being operated without the consent of the owner, the court would order the juvenile incarcerated for a term of 10 days, followed by a term of community service for at least 30 days. Under current law, the court may require a juvenile to make restitution to a person or entity who has suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of the offense for which the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent. Under the bill, the court would not be permitted to order a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, or joyriding to pay restitution. Finally, the provisions of the bill provide that any person who is at least 18 years of age who knowingly uses, solicits, directs, hires, or employs a person 17 years of age or younger to commit theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, or joyriding is to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of between six months and one year for a first offense, and not less than five years for a second or subsequent offense. According to New Jersey officials, as of May 2022 car thefts have increased 37% compared to 2021 and 53% compared to 2020. There were 14,320 vehicles stolen in New Jersey in 2021. Nationally, the National Insurance Crime Bureau has reported an unprecedented rise in car thefts and carjackings in recent years, increasing by 16.5% across the country in 2021 compared to 2019 and nearly 29% compared to 2017. In the view of the sponsor, the increasing numbers of car thefts have had many negative impacts on the community, ranging from an increased fear of crime to the loss of transportation when a vehicle is stolen and costs for car insurance.

STATEMENT This bill increases the penalties imposed on juveniles and adults convicted of motor vehicle theft and related crimes. The bill specifically provides that a person convicted of a first offense of theft of a motor vehicle would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 180 days without eligibility for parole.  A person convicted of a second or subsequent offense would be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of one year without eligibility for parole. The court may also require a person to pay monetary restitution to any person or entity who has suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of the offense. A juvenile adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, or the crime of unlawful taking of a motor vehicle (joy riding) and operating it in a manner that creates a risk of injury or risk of property damage would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of 30 days for a first offense.  For a second offense, the juvenile would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of 60 days followed by a period of time in a nonresidential program operated by a public or private agency. For a third or subsequent offense, the juvenile would be sentenced to incarceration for a term of six months, followed by a period of time in a nonresidential program. If the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of entering and riding in a motor vehicle knowing that the motor vehicle has been taken or is being operated without the consent of the owner, the court would order the juvenile incarcerated for a term of 10 days, followed by a term of community service for at least 30 days. Under current law, the court may require a juvenile to make restitution to a person or entity who has suffered loss resulting from personal injuries or damage to property as a result of the offense for which the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent. Under the bill, the court would not be permitted to order a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent for an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the crime of theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, or joyriding to pay restitution. Finally, the provisions of the bill provide that any person who is at least 18 years of age who knowingly uses, solicits, directs, hires, or employs a person 17 years of age or younger to commit theft of a motor vehicle, the unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, or joyriding is to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of between six months and one year for a first offense, and not less than five years for a second or subsequent offense. According to New Jersey officials, as of May 2022 car thefts have increased 37% compared to 2021 and 53% compared to 2020. There were 14,320 vehicles stolen in New Jersey in 2021. Nationally, the National Insurance Crime Bureau has reported an unprecedented rise in car thefts and carjackings in recent years, increasing by 16.5% across the country in 2021 compared to 2019 and nearly 29% compared to 2017. In the view of the sponsor, the increasing numbers of car thefts have had many negative impacts on the community, ranging from an increased fear of crime to the loss of transportation when a vehicle is stolen and costs for car insurance.
