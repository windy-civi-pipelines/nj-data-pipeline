provided however, that in no case shall funds allocated pursuant to this section be used for any other purpose than the acquisition and preservation of land for recreation and conservation purposes or farmland preservation purposes.  The council may use the criteria in the rules codified at N.J.A.C.7:70-1.1 et seq., and adopted by the council pursuant to subsection y. of section 6 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-6), provided that the rules are, at a minimum, consistent with the provisions of this section. k.    At least once each State fiscal year, the council shall submit to the Garden State Preservation Trust a list of projects recommended to be funded with moneys from the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund.  The Garden State Preservation Trust shall review the submitted project list, and prepare and submit to the Governor and to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly for introduction in the Legislature, proposed legislation appropriating moneys pursuant to this section to fund projects on any such list.  The Legislature may approve one or more appropriation bills containing a project list or lists submitted by the Garden State Preservation Trust pursuant to this subsection. 6.  Section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19) is amended to read as follows: 21. a.  There is created in the Department of the Treasury a special non-lapsing fund to be known as the "Highlands Protection Fund."  The monies in the fund are dedicated and shall be used only to carry out the purposes enumerated in subsection b. of this section.  The fund shall be credited with all revenues collected and deposited in the fund pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-8), all interest and other income received from the investment of monies in the fund, and any monies which, from time to time, may otherwise become available for the purposes of the fund.  Pending the use thereof pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section, the monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer.  Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in subsection b. of this section for other monies in the fund. b.    Monies deposited in the "Highlands Protection Fund" shall be used only for: (1)  payments to the "Highlands Municipal Property Tax Stabilization Fund" established pursuant to subsection b. of section 19 of [this act] P.L.2004, c.120 (C.54:1-85) in such amounts as are necessary to provide property tax stabilization aid pursuant to that section; (2)  payments of watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) and watershed property municipal aid pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (3)  the making of grants by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council pursuant to sections 13 and 18 of [this act] P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-13 and C.13:20-18); and (4) allocations to the Pinelands Property Tax Assistance Fund established pursuant to section 20 of [this act] P.L.2004, c.120 (C.54:1-84). (cf:  P.L.2004, c.120, s.21) 7.  (New section)  a.  Funds shall be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" created pursuant to section 21 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-19) to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid. b.   The State Treasurer shall include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The Legislature shall appropriate the necessary funds to the department for this purpose. 8.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), to allocate $7.5 million annually of constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenue to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (council) for the preservation of land in the Highlands Region. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, which dedicates six percent of the CBT for certain environmental purposes.  Under the Preserve New Jersey Act (act), P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), of the dedicated CBT revenues allocated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, each year:  62 percent is allocated to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for recreation and conservation purposes; 31 percent is allocated to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for farmland preservation; and the remaining seven percent is allocated to the New Jersey Historic Trust for historic preservation. Under this bill, $5 million of the amount allocated each year to the DEP and $2.5 million of the amount allocated to the SADC would be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund, a new fund created by the bill.  These moneys, totaling $7.5 million each year would be used by the council to preserve lands located in the Highlands Region. In addition, this bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region.  The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004.  The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price. In 2004, Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), was enacted to protect and preserve the drinking water and natural resources of the New Jersey Highlands Region, which is the source of the drinking water of more than half of the residents of New Jersey and offers unique hiking, bird watching, fishing, and other naturalist and recreational activities. Approximately 230 square miles, or approximately 17 percent of land, in the Highlands Region, approximately is considered undeveloped, but developable land.  The council administers, pursuant to rules and regulations found at N.J.A.C.7:70-1.1 et seq., two programs to preserve land in the region in order to protecting the regions vital resources:  the Highlands Open Space Partnership Funding Program and the Highlands Development Credit Purchase Program.  This bill would provide a portion of constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys for open space and farmland preservation to the council to be used for these two programs, in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of this bill and rules and regulations adopted by the council. The council would also be able to use the funding to be provided by the bill as the State match to apply for funding from the federal government pursuant to the Highlands Conservation Act, Pub.L. 108-421, or other similar federal funding.  This federal funding is awarded by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service through the Highland Conservation Act Grant Program, which is designed to assist Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania in conserving land and natural resources in the Highlands Region through federal assistance for land conservation projects in which a State entity acquires land, or an interest in land, from a willing seller to permanently protect resources of high conservation value. Finally, this bill would require that State aid be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid.  The State Treasurer would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid.

A landowner may waive any of the requirements of this paragraph and may agree to sell the lands for less than the values determined pursuant to this paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable only to lands the owner of which at the time of proposed acquisition is the same person who owned the lands on the date of enactment of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.) and who has owned the lands continuously since that enactment date, or is an immediate family member of that person.

STATEMENT This bill would amend and supplement the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), to allocate $7.5 million annually of constitutionally dedicated Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenue to the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council (council) for the preservation of land in the Highlands Region. The funding in this bill is provided from constitutionally dedicated CBT revenues pursuant to Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution, which dedicates six percent of the CBT for certain environmental purposes.  Under the Preserve New Jersey Act (act), P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), of the dedicated CBT revenues allocated for open space, farmland, and historic preservation, each year:  62 percent is allocated to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) for recreation and conservation purposes; 31 percent is allocated to the State Agriculture Development Committee (SADC) for farmland preservation; and the remaining seven percent is allocated to the New Jersey Historic Trust for historic preservation. Under this bill, $5 million of the amount allocated each year to the DEP and $2.5 million of the amount allocated to the SADC would be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Highlands Preservation Fund, a new fund created by the bill.  These moneys, totaling $7.5 million each year would be used by the council to preserve lands located in the Highlands Region. In addition, this bill extends the expiration date of the special appraisal process provided by law for State-funded land acquisitions under the Green Acres program and the farmland preservation program from June 30, 2024 to June 30, 2029 for lands located in the Highlands Region.  The term special appraisal process refers to the process in which the State or other eligible participants are currently required by law to conduct two appraisals of lands that are proposed for acquisition, one of which is based on the property value on the proposed acquisition date, the other based on the value of the property as of January 1, 2004.  The higher of the two values is used as the basis of negotiation with the landowner when determining the propertys final acquisition price. In 2004, Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.), was enacted to protect and preserve the drinking water and natural resources of the New Jersey Highlands Region, which is the source of the drinking water of more than half of the residents of New Jersey and offers unique hiking, bird watching, fishing, and other naturalist and recreational activities. Approximately 230 square miles, or approximately 17 percent of land, in the Highlands Region, approximately is considered undeveloped, but developable land.  The council administers, pursuant to rules and regulations found at N.J.A.C.7:70-1.1 et seq., two programs to preserve land in the region in order to protecting the regions vital resources:  the Highlands Open Space Partnership Funding Program and the Highlands Development Credit Purchase Program.  This bill would provide a portion of constitutionally dedicated CBT moneys for open space and farmland preservation to the council to be used for these two programs, in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of this bill and rules and regulations adopted by the council. The council would also be able to use the funding to be provided by the bill as the State match to apply for funding from the federal government pursuant to the Highlands Conservation Act, Pub.L. 108-421, or other similar federal funding.  This federal funding is awarded by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service through the Highland Conservation Act Grant Program, which is designed to assist Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania in conserving land and natural resources in the Highlands Region through federal assistance for land conservation projects in which a State entity acquires land, or an interest in land, from a willing seller to permanently protect resources of high conservation value. Finally, this bill would require that State aid be distributed each State fiscal year from the "Highlands Protection Fund" to each municipality within the Highlands Region that that does not receive watershed moratorium offset aid pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1999, c.225 (C.58:29-8) but hosts watershed lands, for those watershed lands, as determined by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council, in amounts equal to the per acre rate provided for watershed moratorium offset aid.  The State Treasurer would be required to include in its annual budget request to the Governor the moneys necessary to distribute funds to those municipalities eligible for watershed property municipal aid.
