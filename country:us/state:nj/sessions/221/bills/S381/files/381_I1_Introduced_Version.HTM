five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the number

locations shall be geographically located so as to ensure both access in the
part of the county that features the greatest concentration of population,

access in various geographic areas of the county.  All early voting locations
shall be public facilities, such as county courthouses, public libraries and

Revised Statutes. No public school building and no building used as a public

respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the county clerk shall cast
the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each county,
county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these
locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of
registered voters within each county, reflect the population distribution and
density within each county, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary
of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to
revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such
revision shall take place.</p>

occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of
elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess
of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State

each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the

to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early
voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
require voters who vote in person at a polling place, whether during the early
voting period or on election day, to vote by paper ballot only, except in
certain circumstances.  Under the bill, a limited number of voting machines
would be available for use by individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a five-year
phase-in of the use of paper ballots and open source voting technology during
the conduct of elections in this State.  The bill specifies that within five
years all counties in this State must (1) use paper ballots and optical
scanners that read hand-marked paper ballots and (2) use voting equipment
certified for use by the Secretary of State that has open-source software
technology. As used in the bill, the term open-source means the complete
source code for the software is available to the public, under the terms of a
license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or
other considerations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the paper
ballot voting system must:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   provide the local
elections officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper
ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provide a record of
votes cast for the election;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   adhere to any federal
laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   adhere to any other
requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of
a paper ballot voting system in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the Secretary
of State to require that each county board of elections or superintendent of
elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an
election for a period of not less than two years following the date of an
election.  Thereafter, the ballots may be retained in accordance with
procedures set forth by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires that
prior to verification of the official election results by a county clerk or
superintendent of elections or a municipal clerk, as the case may be, the
county clerk or superintendent of elections or municipal clerk must:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   compare and reconcile
the record of votes casts provided by the optical scanners or other voting
equipment certified by the State with the number of voters who signed in at the
polling place and who voted by mail-in, provisional, and military or overseas
ballots;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   compare and reconcile
precinct totals with the totals for that election to ensure that the totals add
up to the correct sum; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   review, and account for,
all optical scanner or other voting equipment memory cards or flash drives to
ensure the memory cards or flash drives are properly loaded into the tally
server.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, after a voter
is deemed qualified to vote in an election, the voter would receive a paper
ballot, which would be completed by the voter in a voting booth.  Once
completed, the ballot would be scanned electronically for technical errors, if
such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any
technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted.  If such an error
exists, it would be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be
spoiled, a new ballot would be given to the voter to enable that person to
correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voters vote
from being counted.  If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no
technical error is found, the ballot would be considered valid and would be
counted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also makes an
appropriation and provides that the cost of replacing exiting direct recording
electronic voting machines with paper ballots and the voting equipment
necessary to tabulate those ballots would be paid for by the State upon
application for reimbursement by a county governing body to the Secretary of
State and approval of the application by the Director of the Division of Budget
and Accounting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also repeals various
statutes concerning certain requirements and the certification of electronic
voting machines and the purchasing and delivery of those voting machines.</p>
