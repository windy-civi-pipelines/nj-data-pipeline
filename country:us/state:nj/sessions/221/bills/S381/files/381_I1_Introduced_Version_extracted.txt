The optical scanners or other voting equipment certified for use by the Secretary of State shall use open-source software technology.  As used in this subsection, the term open-source means the complete source code for the software technology is available to the public, under the terms of a general public license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or other considerations. No voting machines or electronic voting system shall be used to record the votes of voters voting during the early voting period of an election or on the day of an election, except that a limited number of voting machines or electronic voting systems shall be available for use by individuals with disabilities. The Secretary of State shall approve and certify for use any voting machine or electronic voting system intended for use by individuals with disabilities, except that the Secretary of State shall not certify for use any voting machine or electronic voting system that uses proprietary or nonpublic software technology. c.     The paper ballot voting system shall: (1)   provide local election officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place; (2)   provide a record of votes cast for the election; (3)   adhere to any federal laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and (4)   adhere to any other requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of a paper ballot voting system in this State. d.    No ballots other than the paper ballots required for use by subsection b. of this section, emergency ballots as provided in P.L.1992, c.3 (C.19:53B-1 et al), and provisional ballots as provided in P.L.1999, c. 232 (C.19:53C-1 et al.), shall be prepared or used at any election in any election district. 2.  (New section)  a.  The Secretary of State shall require each county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an election under this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for a period of not less than two years following the date of an election.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.145, s.5) 4.    Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.149 (C.19:12-7.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.  a.  A county board of elections shall have posted a voter information notice, which shall be referred to as a voter's bill of rights, in a conspicuous location in each polling place and each specially designated polling place used for early voting before voting begins. The notice shall contain: the date of the election and the hours during which polling places will be open; a statement that sample ballots are available at the polling place for review by the voter; instruction for the use of the voting [machine] equipment in that polling place and an explanation of what instructions for voting are available at the polling place for the voter; instruction for a voter who is voting for the first time; instruction for a voter who is required to provide identification pursuant to the federal "Help America Vote Act of 2002" and R.S.19:15-17 prior to casting a vote; instruction on how to cast a vote if the voter cannot be present at a polling place on the day of the election; an explanation of the right of the voter to vote in private, regardless of the voter's physical abilities; an explanation of the right of the voter to a provisional ballot, including in the event that a mail-in ballot has been applied for and not received or not transmitted to the county board of elections before the day of any election, and the other circumstances under which a voter has a right to a provisional ballot; an explanation of the right of the voter to receive a replacement ballot for a ballot that has been spoiled, destroyed, lost or never received; an explanation of the right of the voter to ask for and receive assistance in voting; an explanation of the right of the voter to take a reasonable amount of time in casting a vote [on a] using a paper ballot and any voting [machine] equipment at the polling place; an explanation of the right of the voter to bring written material into the polling place for the voter's personal use in casting a vote; instruction on how to contact the appropriate officials if a voter's right to vote or right to otherwise participate in the electoral process has been challenged or violated; general information on federal and State laws that prohibit acts of fraud or misrepresentation and the penalties for those acts; an explanation of the right of the voter to confidentially discover the status of their ballot using the "Track My Ballot" user portal; an explanation that "All ballots are counted and your vote remains anonymous"; an explanation of the right of the voter that if their ballot was rejected, a notice will be issued to the voter within 24 hours after a decision is made to reject the ballot.  The voter will have up to 48 hours prior to the date for the final certification of the results of the election to provide a cure for their ballot; an explanation giving the options for the voter to provide the cure to their rejected ballot; an explanation that no voters shall be intimidated or otherwise unduly influenced by political insignia while voting.  No person shall wear, display, sell, give or provide any political or campaign slogan, badge, button or other insignia associated with any political party or candidate to be worn at or within one hundred feet of the polls or within the polling place or room, on any primary, general or special election day or on any commission government election day, except the badge furnished by the county board as provided by law.  This includes any political gear representing the campaign slogans, logos, or depictions or representations of any political party or candidate such as merchandise sold directly from a political party, campaign, candidate, or by third parties and vendors representing any political party or campaign or candidate.  A person violating any of these provisions is guilty of a disorderly persons offense and will not be permitted on the premises and can only return to vote after the removal of prohibited political insignia; and such other statement, instruction or explanation the Secretary of State may deem appropriate to ensure the full and knowledgeable participation of the voter in the process. The requirement to post this notice in each polling place shall not replace, supersede or void any other requirement set forth in law for the posting of information in each polling place apart from the voter information notice.  The poster promoting the use of voting by mail prepared and distributed by the Secretary of State pursuant to R.S.19:8-6 shall be displayed next to or as close as may be possible to the voter information notice. b.    The Secretary of State shall prescribe the form and specific content of the voter information notice, which may be comprised of more than one page.  If the notice is comprised of more than one page, each page shall be posted separately.  For an election district in which the primary language of 10 percent or more of the registered voters is a language other than English, the Secretary of State shall prescribe an official version of the voter information notice in that other language or languages for use in that election district.  The notice shall be posted in English and in the other language or languages in the polling places in each such district.  The alternate language shall be determined based on information from the latest federal decennial census. c.     A county board of elections may modify or supplement the voter information notice used in a county or municipality to provide additional information specific to that county or a municipality in that county, provided, however, that any such modification or supplementation shall be submitted to the Secretary of State for prior approval. d.    The voter information notice shall be printed on each sample ballot, to the extent practicable, or if not practicable, information on how to view or obtain a copy of the voter information notice shall be printed on each sample ballot. e.     The voter information notice, including one modified or supplemented pursuant to subsection c. of this section, shall be made accessible on the official Internet site of the State by the Secretary of State and each county board of elections shall ensure that the official Internet site of the county contains a link to that notice. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2020, c.70) g.    The State shall be liable for the costs incurred by local government entities for compliance with this section, and they shall be reimbursed for those costs, upon application, by the State Treasurer. (cf: P.L.2021, c.40, s.9) 5.    R.S.19:15-17 is amended to read as follows: 19:15-17.  a.  The comparison of signatures of a voter made upon registration and upon election day, and if the voter alleges [his] the voters inability to write, the comparison of the answers made by such voter upon registration and upon election day, shall be had in full view of the challengers. b.    If a voter has registered by mail after January 1, 2003 to vote for the first time in [his or her] the voters current county of residence and did not provide personal identification when registering pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4), the voter shall be permitted to vote starting at the first election held after January 1, 2004 at which candidates are seeking federal office after displaying one of the following items: (1) a current and valid photo identification card; (2) a current utility bill, bank statement, government check or pay check; (3) any other government document that shows the voter's name and current address; or (4) any other identifying document that the [Attorney General] Secretary of State has determined to be acceptable for this purpose.  If the voter does not display one of these documents, the voter shall [not be permitted to vote by machine but shall] instead be provided with a provisional ballot, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 et seq.).  This subsection shall not apply to any voter entitled to vote by absentee ballot under the "Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act" [(42 U.S.C. 1973ff-1 et seq.)] (52 U.S.C. s.20302) or to any voter who is provided the right to vote other than in person under section 3 of Pub.L.98-435, (52 U.S.C. s.20104) the "Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act," or any other voter entitled to vote otherwise than in person under any other federal law.  This subsection shall also not apply to any person who registers to vote by appearing in person at any voter registration agency or to any person whose voter registration form is delivered to the county commissioner of registration or to the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, as the case may be, through a third party by means other than by mail delivery. c.     Each county commissioner of registration shall collect and maintain, in the manner prescribed by the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, the information provided pursuant to subsection b. of this section and section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4).  Access to the personal identification information provided pursuant to subsection b. of this section and section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4) [.] shall be prohibited, in accordance with subsection a. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5). (cf: P.L.2004, c.88, s.9) 6.    R.S.19:15-31 is amended to read as follows: 19:15-31.  [He]  The voter shall then hand the ballot with the coupon undetached to the member of the election board having charge of the ballot box, which member shall call off the number of the ballot and the name of the voter.  If the name and number  agree with the record in the poll book, the election officer having charge of  the poll book shall so announce and place the word "voted" opposite the poll  number to indicate that the person shown thereon as receiving the ballot has voted. In districts having permanent registration the member of the board having charge of the signature copy register shall record the ballot number in the proper column of the record of voting form. The member of the election board in possession of the ballot shall then scan it electronically, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted.  If such an error exists, it shall be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot shall be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voters vote from being counted.  If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found to exist, the ballot shall be considered valid and shall be counted. (cf: R.S.19:15-31) 7.    Section 1 of P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  In addition to all other forms of voting provided for by this Title, a registered voter shall be permitted to vote at a specially designated polling place before the day of certain primary and general elections in this State. This procedure shall be known as early voting. The early voting period shall: (1)   start on the 4th calendar day before a non-presidential primary election for a non-presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that non-presidential primary election; (2)   start on the 6th calendar day before a presidential primary election for a presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that presidential primary election; or (3)   start on the 10th calendar day before a general election and end on the second calendar day before that general election. The voting process during the early voting period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and optical-scan voting [machines] equipment that [read] reads hand-marked paper ballots or other voting [machines] equipment that produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot, except that no later than five years following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the voting process during the early voting period shall only be conducted using optical-scan voting equipment that reads hand-marked paper ballots.  Any municipality conducting regular municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the "Uniform Nonpartisan Elections Law," P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et seq.), may, by an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early voting for the regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.). If adopted by a municipal governing body, the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May shall start on the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and end on the second calendar day before that regular municipal election. An early voting period shall only be permitted for a non-presidential or presidential primary election and a general election in this State and, if adopted by a municipal governing body, a regular municipal election conducted in May. Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and in accordance with procedures that may be established by the Secretary of State for verifying eligible voters, each county board of elections shall verify that a registered voter is qualified to vote in the election and shall prescribe the manner by which a registered voter may vote during such period. b.  (1)  For the primary and the general election, each county board of elections shall designate at least three, but not more than five, public locations within each county as the sites for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than 300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is 300,000 or more. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven, or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered voters in each county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early voting sites pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the Secretary of State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  Whenever possible, early voting locations shall be geographically located so as to ensure both access in the part of the county that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States, and access in various geographic areas of the county.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as county courthouses, public libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk, county clerk, and county board of elections, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes. No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each county, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each county, reflect the population distribution and density within each county, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's county. (2)   Whenever a municipality that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible, each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the municipality that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and the offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the municipal clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each municipality, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each municipality, reflect the population distribution and density within each municipality, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's municipality. c.     Each early voting site in a county or municipality shall be open for early voting on Monday through Saturday from at least 10 AM to 8 PM, and on Sunday from at least 10 AM to 6 PM.  Any voter who is on line at the time scheduled for the closing of an early voting site shall be permitted to vote. d.    The election officers responsible for conducting early voting shall be the same as those responsible for conducting a primary and a general election, as appropriate, pursuant to this Title.  The number of such officers and their hours of service shall be as determined by each county board of elections.  The compensation for such officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant to Article I, paragraph 23 of the New Jersey Constitution, whichever is greater. e.     The restrictions governing the conduct of voters at a polling place on the days that early voting occurs, the procedures governing who is permitted in a polling place on such occasions and the prohibition on electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place during an election, shall be as provided in chapters 15, 34, 50 and 52 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and every other applicable section of this Title. f.     In real time using the electronic poll books each day during the early voting period, and prior to the start of each regularly scheduled primary and general election, and regular municipal election in each non-partisan municipality choosing to participate in early voting, each county board shall make such changes as may be necessary to the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure. g.  (1)  Each county board shall be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of voting [machines] equipment, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted thereto no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall review and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later than February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and security plan for the voting [machines] equipment, and a chain of custody for the voted ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-4). The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject to the penalties established by law. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act. h.    Each county board shall make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation, including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the "Help America Vote Act of 2002" (42 U.S.C. s.15481). i.     The Secretary of State shall establish a printing on demand ballot and elections system.  At a minimum, the system shall be compatible with the Statewide voter registration system established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) and any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer, tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's standards. j.     Each polling place used for early voting shall also have such appropriate supplies, ballots and other materials deemed necessary by the Secretary of State or as is required currently for a polling place on the day of any election by Title 19 of the Revised Statutes. (cf: P.L.2021, c.4, s.1) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  There shall be established in the Department of State a single Statewide voter registration system, as required pursuant to section 303 of the federal "Help America Vote Act of 2002," Pub.L.107-252 (42 U.S.C. s.15483). The principal computer components of the system shall be under the direct control of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall be responsible for creating the network necessary to maintain the system and providing the computer software, hardware and security necessary to ensure that the system is accessible only to those executive departments and State agencies so designated by the Secretary of State, each county commissioner of registration, each county and municipal clerk, and individuals under certain circumstances, as provided for by this section.

The envelope containing the keys shall not be opened until at least two members of the board who are not members of the same political party shall be present at the polling place and shall have examined the envelope to see that it has not been opened.  Before opening the envelope all election officers present shall examine the number on the seal on the [machine] equipment and the number registered on the protective counter, and shall ascertain if they are the same as the numbers written on the envelope; and if they are not the same, the [machine] equipment must not be [opened] used until such county board of elections or such superintendent of elections or such municipal clerk, as the case may be, after due notice of such discrepancy, shall have caused such [machine] equipment to be re-examined and properly arranged by any person or persons employed or appointed pursuant to R.S.19:48-6.  If the numbers on the voting [machine seal] equipment and the protective counter are found to agree with the numbers on the envelope, the district election officers shall proceed to open the doors concealing the counters, and each district election officer shall carefully examine every counter and ascertain whether or not it registers zero (000), and the same shall be subject to the inspection of official watchers. In addition, each district election officer shall carefully examine the emergency ballot box to ascertain whether or not it is properly sealed with a numbered green seal [and examine the number to ascertain if it is the same as the number written on the voting machine key envelope]. If [the numbers are not the same] tampering is suspected, the county board of elections, the superintendent of elections, or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, shall be notified of the discrepancy. The [machine] voting equipment shall remain locked against voting until the polls are formally opened and shall not be operated except by voters in voting.  If any counter is found not to register zero (000) the district board shall immediately notify such county board of elections or such superintendent of elections or such municipal clerk, as the case may be, who shall, if practicable, cause such counter to be adjusted at zero (000) by any person or persons employed or appointed pursuant to R.S.19:48-6.  If it shall be impracticable for such person or persons to arrive in time to so adjust such counter before the time set for opening the polls, the district election officers shall immediately make a written statement of the designating letter and number of such counter, together with the number registered thereon, and shall sign and post same upon the wall of the polling room, where it shall remain throughout election day, and in filling out the statement of canvass, they shall subtract such number from the number registered thereon at the close of the polls. Each district election officer shall carefully examine the provisional ballot bag to ascertain that it is properly sealed with a numbered security seal and whether it has been subjected to tampering.  If the elections officer discovers evidence of tampering, the county board of elections, the superintendent of elections, or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, shall be so notified immediately. (cf: P.L.1999, c.232, s.6) 14.  R.S.19:52-3 is amended to read as follows: 19:52-3.  Where a voter [presents himself] is present at a polling place for the purpose of voting, the election officer shall follow the procedure as now required by this title regarding the eligibility of a person to vote.  If such eligibility is established, one of the district election officers shall announce the name of the voter and permit [him] the voter to pass to the voting booth [of the voting machine] for the purpose of casting his vote.  No voter shall remain in the voting [machine] booth longer than two minutes, and having cast [his] a vote the voter shall at once emerge therefrom and leave the polling room; if [he] the voter shall refuse to leave after the lapse of two minutes [he] the voter shall be removed by the district election officers.  Such election officers shall ascertain the name and address of each voter in the manner now provided by law before [he] the voter enters the voting [machine] booth for the purpose of voting.  No voter after having entered and emerged from the voting [machine] booth shall be permitted to reenter the same on any pretext whatever.  Only one voter at a time shall be permitted in the voting [machine] booth to vote.  However, a voter shall be permitted to be accompanied into the voting [machine] booth by a dependent child.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the Secretary of State, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and within six months of the effective date of this act, shall adopt such rules and regulations as the secretary deems necessary or proper to implement the provisions of this act.  The rules and regulations shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 30.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The purpose of this bill is to require voters who vote in person at a polling place, whether during the early voting period or on election day, to vote by paper ballot only, except in certain circumstances.  Under the bill, a limited number of voting machines would be available for use by individuals with disabilities. The bill requires a five-year phase-in of the use of paper ballots and open source voting technology during the conduct of elections in this State.  The bill specifies that within five years all counties in this State must (1) use paper ballots and optical scanners that read hand-marked paper ballots and (2) use voting equipment certified for use by the Secretary of State that has open-source software technology. As used in the bill, the term open-source means the complete source code for the software is available to the public, under the terms of a license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or other considerations. Under the bill, the paper ballot voting system must: (1)   provide the local elections officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place; (2)   provide a record of votes cast for the election; (3)   adhere to any federal laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and (4)   adhere to any other requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of a paper ballot voting system in this State. The bill directs the Secretary of State to require that each county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an election for a period of not less than two years following the date of an election.  Thereafter, the ballots may be retained in accordance with procedures set forth by the Secretary of State. The bill also requires that prior to verification of the official election results by a county clerk or superintendent of elections or a municipal clerk, as the case may be, the county clerk or superintendent of elections or municipal clerk must: (1)   compare and reconcile the record of votes casts provided by the optical scanners or other voting equipment certified by the State with the number of voters who signed in at the polling place and who voted by mail-in, provisional, and military or overseas ballots; (2)   compare and reconcile precinct totals with the totals for that election to ensure that the totals add up to the correct sum; and (3)   review, and account for, all optical scanner or other voting equipment memory cards or flash drives to ensure the memory cards or flash drives are properly loaded into the tally server. Under the bill, after a voter is deemed qualified to vote in an election, the voter would receive a paper ballot, which would be completed by the voter in a voting booth.  Once completed, the ballot would be scanned electronically for technical errors, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted.  If such an error exists, it would be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot would be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voters vote from being counted.  If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found, the ballot would be considered valid and would be counted. The bill also makes an appropriation and provides that the cost of replacing exiting direct recording electronic voting machines with paper ballots and the voting equipment necessary to tabulate those ballots would be paid for by the State upon application for reimbursement by a county governing body to the Secretary of State and approval of the application by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The bill also repeals various statutes concerning certain requirements and the certification of electronic voting machines and the purchasing and delivery of those voting machines.

The notice shall contain: the date of the election and the hours during which polling places will be open; a statement that sample ballots are available at the polling place for review by the voter; instruction for the use of the voting [machine] equipment in that polling place and an explanation of what instructions for voting are available at the polling place for the voter; instruction for a voter who is voting for the first time; instruction for a voter who is required to provide identification pursuant to the federal "Help America Vote Act of 2002" and R.S.19:15-17 prior to casting a vote; instruction on how to cast a vote if the voter cannot be present at a polling place on the day of the election; an explanation of the right of the voter to vote in private, regardless of the voter's physical abilities; an explanation of the right of the voter to a provisional ballot, including in the event that a mail-in ballot has been applied for and not received or not transmitted to the county board of elections before the day of any election, and the other circumstances under which a voter has a right to a provisional ballot; an explanation of the right of the voter to receive a replacement ballot for a ballot that has been spoiled, destroyed, lost or never received; an explanation of the right of the voter to ask for and receive assistance in voting; an explanation of the right of the voter to take a reasonable amount of time in casting a vote [on a] using a paper ballot and any voting [machine] equipment at the polling place; an explanation of the right of the voter to bring written material into the polling place for the voter's personal use in casting a vote; instruction on how to contact the appropriate officials if a voter's right to vote or right to otherwise participate in the electoral process has been challenged or violated; general information on federal and State laws that prohibit acts of fraud or misrepresentation and the penalties for those acts; an explanation of the right of the voter to confidentially discover the status of their ballot using the "Track My Ballot" user portal; an explanation that "All ballots are counted and your vote remains anonymous"; an explanation of the right of the voter that if their ballot was rejected, a notice will be issued to the voter within 24 hours after a decision is made to reject the ballot.  The voter will have up to 48 hours prior to the date for the final certification of the results of the election to provide a cure for their ballot; an explanation giving the options for the voter to provide the cure to their rejected ballot; an explanation that no voters shall be intimidated or otherwise unduly influenced by political insignia while voting.  No person shall wear, display, sell, give or provide any political or campaign slogan, badge, button or other insignia associated with any political party or candidate to be worn at or within one hundred feet of the polls or within the polling place or room, on any primary, general or special election day or on any commission government election day, except the badge furnished by the county board as provided by law.  This includes any political gear representing the campaign slogans, logos, or depictions or representations of any political party or candidate such as merchandise sold directly from a political party, campaign, candidate, or by third parties and vendors representing any political party or campaign or candidate.  A person violating any of these provisions is guilty of a disorderly persons offense and will not be permitted on the premises and can only return to vote after the removal of prohibited political insignia; and such other statement, instruction or explanation the Secretary of State may deem appropriate to ensure the full and knowledgeable participation of the voter in the process. The requirement to post this notice in each polling place shall not replace, supersede or void any other requirement set forth in law for the posting of information in each polling place apart from the voter information notice.  The poster promoting the use of voting by mail prepared and distributed by the Secretary of State pursuant to R.S.19:8-6 shall be displayed next to or as close as may be possible to the voter information notice. b.    The Secretary of State shall prescribe the form and specific content of the voter information notice, which may be comprised of more than one page.  If the notice is comprised of more than one page, each page shall be posted separately.  For an election district in which the primary language of 10 percent or more of the registered voters is a language other than English, the Secretary of State shall prescribe an official version of the voter information notice in that other language or languages for use in that election district.  The notice shall be posted in English and in the other language or languages in the polling places in each such district.  The alternate language shall be determined based on information from the latest federal decennial census. c.     A county board of elections may modify or supplement the voter information notice used in a county or municipality to provide additional information specific to that county or a municipality in that county, provided, however, that any such modification or supplementation shall be submitted to the Secretary of State for prior approval. d.    The voter information notice shall be printed on each sample ballot, to the extent practicable, or if not practicable, information on how to view or obtain a copy of the voter information notice shall be printed on each sample ballot. e.     The voter information notice, including one modified or supplemented pursuant to subsection c. of this section, shall be made accessible on the official Internet site of the State by the Secretary of State and each county board of elections shall ensure that the official Internet site of the county contains a link to that notice. f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2020, c.70) g.    The State shall be liable for the costs incurred by local government entities for compliance with this section, and they shall be reimbursed for those costs, upon application, by the State Treasurer. (cf: P.L.2021, c.40, s.9) 5.    R.S.19:15-17 is amended to read as follows: 19:15-17.  a.  The comparison of signatures of a voter made upon registration and upon election day, and if the voter alleges [his] the voters inability to write, the comparison of the answers made by such voter upon registration and upon election day, shall be had in full view of the challengers. b.    If a voter has registered by mail after January 1, 2003 to vote for the first time in [his or her] the voters current county of residence and did not provide personal identification when registering pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4), the voter shall be permitted to vote starting at the first election held after January 1, 2004 at which candidates are seeking federal office after displaying one of the following items: (1) a current and valid photo identification card; (2) a current utility bill, bank statement, government check or pay check; (3) any other government document that shows the voter's name and current address; or (4) any other identifying document that the [Attorney General] Secretary of State has determined to be acceptable for this purpose.  If the voter does not display one of these documents, the voter shall [not be permitted to vote by machine but shall] instead be provided with a provisional ballot, pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 et seq.).  This subsection shall not apply to any voter entitled to vote by absentee ballot under the "Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act" [(42 U.S.C. 1973ff-1 et seq.)] (52 U.S.C. s.20302) or to any voter who is provided the right to vote other than in person under section 3 of Pub.L.98-435, (52 U.S.C. s.20104) the "Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act," or any other voter entitled to vote otherwise than in person under any other federal law.  This subsection shall also not apply to any person who registers to vote by appearing in person at any voter registration agency or to any person whose voter registration form is delivered to the county commissioner of registration or to the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, as the case may be, through a third party by means other than by mail delivery. c.     Each county commissioner of registration shall collect and maintain, in the manner prescribed by the [Attorney General] Secretary of State, the information provided pursuant to subsection b. of this section and section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4).  Access to the personal identification information provided pursuant to subsection b. of this section and section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4) [.] shall be prohibited, in accordance with subsection a. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5). (cf: P.L.2004, c.88, s.9) 6.    R.S.19:15-31 is amended to read as follows: 19:15-31.  [He]  The voter shall then hand the ballot with the coupon undetached to the member of the election board having charge of the ballot box, which member shall call off the number of the ballot and the name of the voter.  If the name and number  agree with the record in the poll book, the election officer having charge of  the poll book shall so announce and place the word "voted" opposite the poll  number to indicate that the person shown thereon as receiving the ballot has voted. In districts having permanent registration the member of the board having charge of the signature copy register shall record the ballot number in the proper column of the record of voting form. The member of the election board in possession of the ballot shall then scan it electronically, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted.  If such an error exists, it shall be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot shall be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voters vote from being counted.  If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found to exist, the ballot shall be considered valid and shall be counted. (cf: R.S.19:15-31) 7.    Section 1 of P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  In addition to all other forms of voting provided for by this Title, a registered voter shall be permitted to vote at a specially designated polling place before the day of certain primary and general elections in this State. This procedure shall be known as early voting. The early voting period shall: (1)   start on the 4th calendar day before a non-presidential primary election for a non-presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that non-presidential primary election; (2)   start on the 6th calendar day before a presidential primary election for a presidential general election and end on the second calendar day before that presidential primary election; or (3)   start on the 10th calendar day before a general election and end on the second calendar day before that general election. The voting process during the early voting period shall be conducted using electronic poll books and optical-scan voting [machines] equipment that [read] reads hand-marked paper ballots or other voting [machines] equipment that produce a voter-verifiable paper ballot, except that no later than five years following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the voting process during the early voting period shall only be conducted using optical-scan voting equipment that reads hand-marked paper ballots.  Any municipality conducting regular municipal elections in May pursuant to the provisions of the "Uniform Nonpartisan Elections Law," P.L.1981, c.379 (C.40:45-5 et seq.), may, by an ordinance adopted by its governing body, also conduct early voting for the regular municipal election, in accordance with the provisions of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.). If adopted by a municipal governing body, the early voting period for a regular municipal election in May shall start on the 4th calendar day before the regular municipal election and end on the second calendar day before that regular municipal election. An early voting period shall only be permitted for a non-presidential or presidential primary election and a general election in this State and, if adopted by a municipal governing body, a regular municipal election conducted in May. Pursuant to the provisions of this act and Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and in accordance with procedures that may be established by the Secretary of State for verifying eligible voters, each county board of elections shall verify that a registered voter is qualified to vote in the election and shall prescribe the manner by which a registered voter may vote during such period. b.  (1)  For the primary and the general election, each county board of elections shall designate at least three, but not more than five, public locations within each county as the sites for early voting to occur, except that the county board shall designate at least five, but not more than seven, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is at least 150,000 but less than 300,000, and shall designate at least seven, but not more than 10, public locations for early voting if the number of registered voters in the county is 300,000 or more. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent county boards of elections, at their discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the five, seven, or 10 location limits respectively set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the five, seven, or 10 respective limits established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond those limits under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  The number of registered voters in each county shall be determined ahead of the selection of early voting sites pursuant to a uniform standard which shall be developed by the Secretary of State through the rulemaking process pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.).  Whenever possible, early voting locations shall be geographically located so as to ensure both access in the part of the county that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States, and access in various geographic areas of the county.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as county courthouses, public libraries and the offices of the municipal clerk, county clerk, and county board of elections, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes. No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall, however, be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each county, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each county, reflect the population distribution and density within each county, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's county. (2)   Whenever a municipality that conducts regular municipal elections in May chooses to participate in early voting for the regular municipal election, the county board of elections shall designate at least one public location, but not more than three public locations, within the municipality as the site or sites for early voting to occur. This provision shall not be interpreted to prevent a county board of elections, at its discretion, from establishing additional locations in excess of the three location limit set forth herein; provided, however, that the State shall be required to provide reimbursement for the costs of locations up to and including the three location limit established herein, and shall not be required to provide reimbursement for additional locations beyond that limit under section 6 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-6).  Whenever possible, each such location shall be geographically located in the part of the municipality that features the greatest concentration of population, according to the most recent federal decennial census of the United States.  All early voting locations shall be public facilities, such as municipal courthouses and the offices of the municipal clerk, or places of public accommodation as provided under Title 10 of the Revised Statutes.  No public school building and no building used as a public school, as that term is defined under N.J.S.18A:1-1, shall be designated as an early voting location.  The locations shall be designated at the same time as all other polling places are designated by the board of elections.  In the event of a tie vote among members of the county board with respect to the selection of sites for early voting, the municipal clerk shall cast the deciding vote.  Once early voting locations are designated in each municipality, county boards of election shall evaluate and, if deemed necessary, revise these locations in order to accommodate significant changes in the number of registered voters within each municipality, reflect the population distribution and density within each municipality, or because of similar circumstances.  The Secretary of State may develop the criteria to be used by county boards of election to revise the location of early voting sites and shall prescribe how often such revision shall take place. A voter shall be permitted to vote at any early voting site in the voter's municipality. c.     Each early voting site in a county or municipality shall be open for early voting on Monday through Saturday from at least 10 AM to 8 PM, and on Sunday from at least 10 AM to 6 PM.  Any voter who is on line at the time scheduled for the closing of an early voting site shall be permitted to vote. d.    The election officers responsible for conducting early voting shall be the same as those responsible for conducting a primary and a general election, as appropriate, pursuant to this Title.  The number of such officers and their hours of service shall be as determined by each county board of elections.  The compensation for such officers shall be the same as provided to district board of election members serving at a school election pursuant to R.S.19:45-6, or that required pursuant to Article I, paragraph 23 of the New Jersey Constitution, whichever is greater. e.     The restrictions governing the conduct of voters at a polling place on the days that early voting occurs, the procedures governing who is permitted in a polling place on such occasions and the prohibition on electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place during an election, shall be as provided in chapters 15, 34, 50 and 52 of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes and every other applicable section of this Title. f.     In real time using the electronic poll books each day during the early voting period, and prior to the start of each regularly scheduled primary and general election, and regular municipal election in each non-partisan municipality choosing to participate in early voting, each county board shall make such changes as may be necessary to the voter's record in the Statewide voter registration system to indicate that a voter has voted in that election using the early voting procedure. g.  (1)  Each county board shall be responsible for forming and executing a written plan to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, the integrity of the voting process and the security of ballots used during the early voting period, including the security of voting [machines] equipment, voted ballots, and election records.  The plan shall be based on guidelines established by the Secretary of State and shall be submitted thereto no later than December 15 of each year.  The Secretary of State shall review and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes to a plan no later than February 1 of each year.  Each plan shall specify a chain of custody and security plan for the voting [machines] equipment, and a chain of custody for the voted ballots and election records and materials, and shall require, among other specifications deemed necessary by the Secretary of State and county boards of election, that all voted ballots shall be transferred at the end of each early voting day to county boards of election for safekeeping.  After the voted ballots are transferred to the county board of elections at the end of each early voting day, a county board may elect to impound those voted ballots on a secure server, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the Secretary of State.  The voted ballots shall not be canvassed until the closing of the polls on election day as required pursuant to section 4 of this act, P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-4). The results of the voted ballots cast during early voting shall remain confidential and shall be disclosed only in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, regulations, and guidelines concerning the disclosure of election results, and a violation shall be subject to the penalties established by law. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, in the year in which P.L.2021, c.40 (C.19:15A-1 et al.) becomes law, each county board shall submit its plan to the Secretary of State within 30 days following the effective date of this act and the Secretary of State shall review it and, if deemed necessary thereby, require changes in the plan within 45 days following the effective date of this act. h.    Each county board shall make certain that each polling place used for early voting shall be accessible to individuals with disabilities and the elderly, in compliance with the "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s.12101 et seq.), and that each polling place provides such voters, including the blind and visually impaired, the same opportunity for access and participation, including privacy and independence, as other voters in compliance with the "Help America Vote Act of 2002" (42 U.S.C. s.15481). i.     The Secretary of State shall establish a printing on demand ballot and elections system.  At a minimum, the system shall be compatible with the Statewide voter registration system established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) and any electronic poll books provided by section 1 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-35).  Each polling place used for early voting shall have a computer, tablet, or other electronic device to print provisional ballots for voters required to vote by provisional ballot in accordance with the provisions of Title 19 of the Revised Statutes or due to an equipment malfunction as further provided under section 3 of P.L.2019, c.80 (C.19:31-37), or any other election related material, if needed.  A computer, tablet, or other electronic device and the printer used to print election materials at a polling place shall not be used unless it has been certified by the Secretary of State.  The Secretary of State shall adopt and publish standards and regulations governing the certification and use of computer, tablets, or other electronic devices and printers to print election materials at each polling place used for early voting.  The Secretary of State shall not certify a computer, tablet, or other electronic device or printer unless it is in compliance with the secretary's standards. j.     Each polling place used for early voting shall also have such appropriate supplies, ballots and other materials deemed necessary by the Secretary of State or as is required currently for a polling place on the day of any election by Title 19 of the Revised Statutes. (cf: P.L.2021, c.4, s.1) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2005, c.145 (C.19:31-31) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  There shall be established in the Department of State a single Statewide voter registration system, as required pursuant to section 303 of the federal "Help America Vote Act of 2002," Pub.L.107-252 (42 U.S.C. s.15483). The principal computer components of the system shall be under the direct control of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State shall be responsible for creating the network necessary to maintain the system and providing the computer software, hardware and security necessary to ensure that the system is accessible only to those executive departments and State agencies so designated by the Secretary of State, each county commissioner of registration, each county and municipal clerk, and individuals under certain circumstances, as provided for by this section.

(5)   the ability to permit each municipal clerk to view or print information in the system; (6)   the ability to permit an individual, by July 1, 2006, to verify via the Internet whether that individual, and only that individual, is included in the system as a legally registered voter, whether the information pertaining to that individual required by subsection c. of this section is correct, and if not, a means to notify the pertinent county commissioner of registration of the corrections that must be made and to so verify in a way that does not give one individual access to the information required by subsection c. of this section for any other individual; (7)   a Statewide street address index and map in electronic form that can accurately identify the location of every legally registered voter in this State; (8)   the ability to record and monitor all requests for mail-in ballots;

to update the system to allow the postal tracking of mail-in ballots using Intelligent Mail barcodes, or a similar successor tracking system, upon the finding by the Secretary of State that such technology is viable; and to make such information available to the Secretary of State so that a voter can be notified whether the application for such a ballot was accepted or rejected, and the reason for the rejection, using the free-access system established by section 5 of P.L.2004, c.88 (C.19:61-5); and (9)   any other functions required pursuant to Pub.L.107-252 (42 U.S.C. s.15301 et seq.), or Title 19 of the Revised Statutes, or that may be deemed necessary by the Secretary of State. c.     The Statewide voter registration system shall include, but not be limited to, the following information for every legally registered voter in this State: (1)   last, first and middle name;

(cf: P.L.1947, s.167, s.28) 12.  R.S.19:50-3 is amended to read as follows: 19:50-3.  [For instructing the voters on any election day there shall, so far as practicable, be provided by the county board of elections or the superintendent of elections or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, having custody of voting machines, for each polling place a mechanically operated model of a portion of the face of the machine.  Such model, if furnished, shall, during the election, be located on the district election officers' table or in some other place which the voters must pass to reach the machine, and each voter shall, before entering the voting machine booth, be instructed regarding the operation of the machine and such instruction illustrated on the model, and the voter given opportunity to personally operate the modeL.   The voter's attention shall also be called to the diagram of the face of the machine so that the voter can become familiar with the location of the questions and the names of the officers and candidates.] If any voter, before entering the voting [machine] booth, declares under oath, and establishes to the satisfaction of a majority of all the members of the district board that by reason of an inability to read or write, blindness or other physical disability [he] the voter is unable to cast [his] the voters vote without assistance, [he] the voter shall have the assistance of two members of the board of opposite political faith, to be assigned by the board.  Such members shall retire with such voter to the booth and assist [him] the voter. The member acting as clerk of the district board shall make an entry on a disability certificate for assistance, which entry shall be on the form of an oath inserted in the front of the duplicate registry binders at each election.

The disability certificates shall be numbered serially 1 to 20.  The commissioner of registration shall furnish sufficient disability certificates for assistance for each election district in [his] the commissioners county which shall be inserted in the front of the duplicate registry binders. (cf: P.L.1985, c.20, s.2) 13.  R.S.19:52-1 is amended to read as follows: 19:52-1.  The district boards of each election district shall meet at the polling place three-quarters of an hour before the time set for opening of the polls at each election and shall proceed to arrange the furniture, stationery and voting [machine or machines] equipment for the conduct of the election.  The district boards shall then and there have the voting [machine,] equipment, ballots, and stationery required to be delivered to them for such election by the officials charged by law with that duty. The keys to the voting [machine] equipment shall be delivered to the district election officers in any manner that the county board of elections or the superintendent of elections or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, having custody of voting [machines] equipment, may determine, at least three-quarters of an hour before the time set for opening the polls, in a sealed envelope, on which shall be written or printed the number and location of the voting [machine] equipment, the number of the seal with which it is sealed, the number of the green seal with which the emergency ballot box is sealed, and the number registered on the protective counter or device, as reported by the custodian. The envelope containing the keys shall not be opened until at least two members of the board who are not members of the same political party shall be present at the polling place and shall have examined the envelope to see that it has not been opened.  Before opening the envelope all election officers present shall examine the number on the seal on the [machine] equipment and the number registered on the protective counter, and shall ascertain if they are the same as the numbers written on the envelope; and if they are not the same, the [machine] equipment must not be [opened] used until such county board of elections or such superintendent of elections or such municipal clerk, as the case may be, after due notice of such discrepancy, shall have caused such [machine] equipment to be re-examined and properly arranged by any person or persons employed or appointed pursuant to R.S.19:48-6.  If the numbers on the voting [machine seal] equipment and the protective counter are found to agree with the numbers on the envelope, the district election officers shall proceed to open the doors concealing the counters, and each district election officer shall carefully examine every counter and ascertain whether or not it registers zero (000), and the same shall be subject to the inspection of official watchers. In addition, each district election officer shall carefully examine the emergency ballot box to ascertain whether or not it is properly sealed with a numbered green seal [and examine the number to ascertain if it is the same as the number written on the voting machine key envelope]. If [the numbers are not the same] tampering is suspected, the county board of elections, the superintendent of elections, or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, shall be notified of the discrepancy. The [machine] voting equipment shall remain locked against voting until the polls are formally opened and shall not be operated except by voters in voting.  If any counter is found not to register zero (000) the district board shall immediately notify such county board of elections or such superintendent of elections or such municipal clerk, as the case may be, who shall, if practicable, cause such counter to be adjusted at zero (000) by any person or persons employed or appointed pursuant to R.S.19:48-6.  If it shall be impracticable for such person or persons to arrive in time to so adjust such counter before the time set for opening the polls, the district election officers shall immediately make a written statement of the designating letter and number of such counter, together with the number registered thereon, and shall sign and post same upon the wall of the polling room, where it shall remain throughout election day, and in filling out the statement of canvass, they shall subtract such number from the number registered thereon at the close of the polls. Each district election officer shall carefully examine the provisional ballot bag to ascertain that it is properly sealed with a numbered security seal and whether it has been subjected to tampering.  If the elections officer discovers evidence of tampering, the county board of elections, the superintendent of elections, or the municipal clerk, as the case may be, shall be so notified immediately. (cf: P.L.1999, c.232, s.6) 14.  R.S.19:52-3 is amended to read as follows: 19:52-3.  Where a voter [presents himself] is present at a polling place for the purpose of voting, the election officer shall follow the procedure as now required by this title regarding the eligibility of a person to vote.  If such eligibility is established, one of the district election officers shall announce the name of the voter and permit [him] the voter to pass to the voting booth [of the voting machine] for the purpose of casting his vote.  No voter shall remain in the voting [machine] booth longer than two minutes, and having cast [his] a vote the voter shall at once emerge therefrom and leave the polling room; if [he] the voter shall refuse to leave after the lapse of two minutes [he] the voter shall be removed by the district election officers.  Such election officers shall ascertain the name and address of each voter in the manner now provided by law before [he] the voter enters the voting [machine] booth for the purpose of voting.  No voter after having entered and emerged from the voting [machine] booth shall be permitted to reenter the same on any pretext whatever.  Only one voter at a time shall be permitted in the voting [machine] booth to vote.  However, a voter shall be permitted to be accompanied into the voting [machine] booth by a dependent child.

(cf: P.L.1992, c.3, s.12) 18.  Section 13 of P.L.1992, c.3 (19:53B-4) is amended to read as follows: 13.  If it becomes necessary to use the emergency ballot box, and if the numbers on the green seal and the voting [machine] equipment key envelope were identical when previously examined as provided in R.S.19:52-1, the judge of the district board shall remove the emergency ballots and the envelope containing the numbered white and red seals from the box; shall open the envelope, remove the seals, compare the numbers on the seals with those on the face of the envelope, and note on the envelope any discrepancies; shall place the red seal back in the envelope and return the envelope to the ballot box; and shall, in an open and public manner, exhibit the emergency ballot box so that those present may see that the box is now empty except for the envelope containing the numbered red seal.  The judge shall close and re-seal the emergency ballot box with the numbered white seal removed from the envelope in the box, leaving open the aperture in the lid thereof. If the numbers on the green seal and the voting [machine] equipment key envelope were not identical when previously examined as provided in R.S.19:52-1 but the appropriate county board of elections, superintendent of elections, or municipal clerk, as the case may be, has authorized the use of the emergency ballot box, the emergency ballot box may be opened and handled in the manner prescribed above.  If the appropriate county board, superintendent, or municipal clerk, as the case may be, has not yet authorized the use of the emergency ballot box, the appropriate county board, superintendent, or municipal clerk shall again be notified and the emergency ballot box shall not be opened until that county board, superintendent, or municipal clerk authorizes the use of the box.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the Secretary of State, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and within six months of the effective date of this act, shall adopt such rules and regulations as the secretary deems necessary or proper to implement the provisions of this act.  The rules and regulations shall be effective as regulations immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months, and may, thereafter, be amended, adopted or readopted by the Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 30.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT The purpose of this bill is to require voters who vote in person at a polling place, whether during the early voting period or on election day, to vote by paper ballot only, except in certain circumstances.  Under the bill, a limited number of voting machines would be available for use by individuals with disabilities. The bill requires a five-year phase-in of the use of paper ballots and open source voting technology during the conduct of elections in this State.  The bill specifies that within five years all counties in this State must (1) use paper ballots and optical scanners that read hand-marked paper ballots and (2) use voting equipment certified for use by the Secretary of State that has open-source software technology. As used in the bill, the term open-source means the complete source code for the software is available to the public, under the terms of a license, to use, modify, or distribute freely without payment of royalties or other considerations. Under the bill, the paper ballot voting system must: (1)   provide the local elections officials with the ability to scan and tabulate a hand-marked paper ballot prepared by the voter at the polling place; (2)   provide a record of votes cast for the election; (3)   adhere to any federal laws or regulations concerning voting equipment; and (4)   adhere to any other requirements the Secretary of State deems appropriate for the implementation of a paper ballot voting system in this State. The bill directs the Secretary of State to require that each county board of elections or superintendent of elections, as the case may be, to maintain all paper ballots cast in an election for a period of not less than two years following the date of an election.  Thereafter, the ballots may be retained in accordance with procedures set forth by the Secretary of State. The bill also requires that prior to verification of the official election results by a county clerk or superintendent of elections or a municipal clerk, as the case may be, the county clerk or superintendent of elections or municipal clerk must: (1)   compare and reconcile the record of votes casts provided by the optical scanners or other voting equipment certified by the State with the number of voters who signed in at the polling place and who voted by mail-in, provisional, and military or overseas ballots; (2)   compare and reconcile precinct totals with the totals for that election to ensure that the totals add up to the correct sum; and (3)   review, and account for, all optical scanner or other voting equipment memory cards or flash drives to ensure the memory cards or flash drives are properly loaded into the tally server. Under the bill, after a voter is deemed qualified to vote in an election, the voter would receive a paper ballot, which would be completed by the voter in a voting booth.  Once completed, the ballot would be scanned electronically for technical errors, if such equipment is available, to ascertain whether the ballot contains any technical errors that would disqualify it from being counted.  If such an error exists, it would be returned to the voter for correction or if determined to be spoiled, a new ballot would be given to the voter to enable that person to correct any technical error that would otherwise disqualify the voters vote from being counted.  If a voted ballot is scanned electronically and no technical error is found, the ballot would be considered valid and would be counted. The bill also makes an appropriation and provides that the cost of replacing exiting direct recording electronic voting machines with paper ballots and the voting equipment necessary to tabulate those ballots would be paid for by the State upon application for reimbursement by a county governing body to the Secretary of State and approval of the application by the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. The bill also repeals various statutes concerning certain requirements and the certification of electronic voting machines and the purchasing and delivery of those voting machines.
