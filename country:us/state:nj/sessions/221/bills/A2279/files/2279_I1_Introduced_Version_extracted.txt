Under the bill, the board will be required to adopt the Appraisal Qualification Boards practical application of real estate appraisal (PAREA) program as an alternative means of acquiring experiential requirements for a prospective real estate appraiser looking to become a licensed or certified appraiser. Presently, a prospective real estate appraiser must locate a licensed or certified appraiser who is willing to supervise the prospective appraiser as they attain their experiential requirement.  The process to find a supervisor is difficult, with no formal process to help aspiring appraisers find a supervisor that can oversee them. Under PAREA, prospective real estate appraisers can fulfill up to 100% of their experience requirements virtually by creating real-world simulations that combine appraisal theory and methodology.  PAREA also provides prospective real estate appraisers with mentors to supervise them.
