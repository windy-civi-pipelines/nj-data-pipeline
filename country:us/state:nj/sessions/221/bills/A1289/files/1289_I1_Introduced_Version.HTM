CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Supplement to the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, P.L.2023, c.74. Be It Enacted by the Senate and the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  In addition to the amounts appropriated under P.L.2023, c.74, the annual appropriations act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, there is appropriated from the General Fund the following amount for the purpose specified: 34 EDUCATION 30 Educational, Cultural, and Intellectual Development 31 Direct Educational Services and Assistance 5120 Division of School Finance and Regulatory Services STATE AID 02-5120  Nonpublic School Aid ....................................... $19,450,000 Total State Aid appropriation, Direct Educational Services and Assistance $19,450,000 State Aid: 02    Nonpublic Security Aid...................... ($19,450,000) From the amount hereinabove appropriated for Nonpublic Security Aid, the Commissioner of Education shall provide State aid to each school district in an amount equal to [$205] $338 multiplied by the number of nonpublic school students within the district identified by the district on or before November 5 for security services, equipment, or technology to ensure a safe and secure school environment for nonpublic school students. 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides a supplemental appropriation of $19.45 million from the General Fund to the Department of Education for Nonpublic Security Aid, for nonpublic schools in New Jersey. This bill also modifies budget language to adjust the per pupil Nonpublic Security Aid amount from $205 to $338 to account for the $19.45 million increase. In total this supplemental appropriation would increase the amount of funding for Nonpublic Security Aid from $30.55 million to $50 million. The demand for this increase is driven, in part, by inflationary pressures resulting in higher costs for essential security equipment for nonpublic schools. Moreover, many religious-based private schools are grappling with an increase in hate crimes across the country. Additionally, the growing number of private schools opening in New Jersey further contributes to the necessity of increased nonpublic security funding. Nonpublic Security Aid is provided pursuant to N.J.S.A.18:A58-37.8 in order to support Boards of Education in providing security services, equipment, and technology to enhance the protection of nonpublic school pupils.
