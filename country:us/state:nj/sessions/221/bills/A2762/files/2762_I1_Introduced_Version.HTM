P.L.2013, c.63 (C.33:1-12.50 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known,
and may be cited, as the Food Desert Elimination Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.   The Legislature
finds and declares that: (1) there are certain areas of the State, known as
&quot;food desert&quot; communities, in which residents are unable to obtain
reasonable and adequate access to nutritious foods and, in particular, to fresh
fruits and vegetables; (2) the inaccessibility of nutritious food in  food
desert communities has been attributed, in large part, to the absence of
supermarkets and grocery stores in those communities; (3) low-income families
are more likely than others to live in  food desert communities and to lack the
transportation or financial resources necessary to reach distant wholesome
markets; and (4) the establishment of financial incentives to supermarkets and
grocery stores is a reasonable means by which to ensure that residents of  food
desert communities in the State are provided with reasonable access to
nutritious, fresh, and delicious produce, and are afforded the opportunity
thereby to make healthier eating choices for themselves and for their families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that it is both reasonable and necessary to authorize the
New Jersey Economic Development Authority to establish a program that provides
incentives to supermarkets and grocery stores to establish and retain locations
in food desert communities in order to provide a consistent, and easily accessible,
source of fresh produce to residents in those communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Authority means the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the Department
of Agriculture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Food desert community or
community means a physically contiguous area in the State in which residents
have limited access to nutritious foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables,
through supermarkets and grocery stores and which has been designated as a food
desert community pursuant to subsection b. of section 4 of P.L.     , c.    
(C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Program means the Food
Desert Elimination Program established in section 4 of P.L.    , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

consumption off the permitted premises, as described in section 10 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending

means a retail facility of at least 18,000 square feet, of which at least 90
percent is occupied by a full-service supermarket or grocery store.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.         There is
established the Food Desert Elimination Program to be administered by the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority.  The program shall include tax credit
components, as provided in sections 5 and 6 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending

component, as provided in sections 7 and 10 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        and
C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in order to incentivize
 businesses to establish and then retain new supermarkets and grocery stores in
food desert communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The authority, in
consultation with the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Community
Affairs, shall initially designate not more than 75 separate geographic areas
that are most in need of a supermarket or grocery store as food desert communities
in this State.  The authority shall develop criteria for the designation of
food desert communities, but each separate food desert community shall consist of
a distinct geographic area with a single defined border.  The criteria shall,
at a minimum, incorporate analysis of municipal or census tract poverty
statistics, food desert information from the United States Department of
Agricultures Economic Research Service, and healthier food retail tract
information from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The
authority may also consider data related to municipal or census tract
population size and population density in making food desert community
