<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>     <span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  There is created in
the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs a Military and Veterans Affairs
Oversight Board.  The board shall be responsible for the oversight of: (1) all
veteran service officers; (2) each board, council, commission, program, and
such similar entity, within the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs;
and (3) all programs, benefits, and services provided specifically to military
service members, veterans, and their families by any State Executive Branch
department, division, commission, or agency.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board shall consist
of the head of each veteran 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(19) tax-exempt organization
under the Internal Revenue Code operating in the State, or a designee.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The heads of the American
Legion Department of New Jersey, the Disabled American Veterans Department of
New Jersey, and the Department of New Jersey Veterans of Foreign Wars, or their
designees, shall serve as co-chairs for the first three meetings.  By the
conclusion of the third meeting, the members of the board shall vote to elect a
chair and vice-chair.  The chair and vice-chair elected by a majority vote of
the members of the board shall serve for a term of three years.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  For the performance of its
work, the board may request and avail itself of and utilize the service of any
officer or employee of the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs who
shall render such assistance as the board may require without additional
compensation.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  Each member of the board
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable traveling and other expenses
necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties.  In addition, each
member shall receive a per diem allowance of $1,000 for each monthly meeting of
the board attended, provided, however, that no member shall in any case receive
per diem compensation as such member in an amount in excess of $12,000 for any
one calendar year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  The board shall establish
procedures for the conduct of its meetings and activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  The board shall meet
once in each calendar month, but no less than 11 such monthly meetings per
calendar year.  The failure of a member of the board to participate in a
minimum of one monthly meeting every eight months shall result in removal of
that board member.  The member shall be replaced by another representative from
the same organization.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  The board may hold such
additional meetings as it may deem necessary and appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A meeting of the board may be
called by the chair or by a majority of its members, and a majority of the
entire authorized membership of the board shall constitute a quorum at any
meeting thereof.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  The board may hold public
meetings and hearings at such places and at such times as it shall designate,
at which it may solicit the testimony of interested persons, groups, and the
general public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  (1)  Each Executive
Branch department, division, commission, and agency that provides programs,
benefits, and services specifically for military service members, veterans, and
their families shall appoint a liaison to the board.  The liaison shall not be
a member of the board, but shall act as the point of contact to the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Each Executive Branch
department, division, commission, and agency that provides programs, benefits,
and services specifically to military service members, veterans, and their
families shall provide a biannual report to the board.  The report shall
describe in detail such programs, benefits, and services provided to military
service members, veterans, and their families, the number of persons assisted,
plans to expand to reach additional military service members, veterans, and
their families, and such other information deemed necessary and appropriate by
the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  Each Executive branch
department, division, commission, and agency that provides programs, benefits,
and services specifically to military service members, veterans, and their
families, including the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, shall
annually present to the board that portion of their State and federal, if
applicable, budget that represents those programs, benefits, and services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  Each board, council,
commission, and such similar entity, within the Department of Military and
Veterans Affairs shall appoint a liaison to the board.  The liaison shall not
be a member of the board, but shall act as the point of contact to the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  Each board, council,

assisted, plans to expand to reach additional military service members, veterans,
and their families, and such other information deemed necessary and appropriate
by the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The department shall, upon
request and when available, provide copies of the reports of the contractors
relating to military mission maintenance and growth, subject to the provisions
of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Each liaison shall attend
the monthly meetings of the board, and shall attend no less than 10 monthly
meetings per year.  The failure of a liaison to participate in a minimum of one
monthly meeting every 10 months shall result in removal of that liaison.  The
liaison shall be replaced by another employee who shall serve as liaison.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  The responsibilities
