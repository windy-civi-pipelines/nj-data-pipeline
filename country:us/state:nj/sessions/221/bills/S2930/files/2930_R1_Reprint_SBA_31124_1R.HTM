Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the fee assessed for the duplication of a government record embodied in the form of printed matter shall be $0.05 per letter size page or smaller, and $0.07 per legal size page or larger.  [If a public agency can demonstrate that its actual costs for duplication of a government record exceed the foregoing rates, the public agency shall be permitted to charge the actual cost of duplicating the record.  The actual cost of duplicating the record, upon which all copy fees are based, shall be the cost of materials and supplies used to make a copy of the record, but shall not include the cost of labor or other overhead expenses associated with making the copy except as provided for in subsection c. of this section.]  Access to electronic records and non-printed materials shall be provided free of charge , but the public agency may charge for the actual costs of any needed supplies such as computer discs.  No fee shall be charged if the request is completed by directing the requestor to the requested government record that is available on the public agencys website or the website of another public agency. (2)  No fee shall be charged to a victim of a crime for a copy or copies of a record to which the crime victim is entitled to access, as provided in section 1 of P.L.1995, c.23 (C.47:1A-1.1). c.   Whenever the nature, format, manner of collation, or volume of a government record embodied in the form of printed matter to be inspected, examined, or copied pursuant to this section is such that the record cannot be reproduced by ordinary document copying equipment in ordinary business size or involves an extraordinary expenditure of time and effort to accommodate the request, the public agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplicating the record, a special service charge that [shall be reasonable and] shall be based upon the actual direct cost of providing the copy or copies [; provided, however, that in the case of a municipality, rates for the duplication of particular records when the actual cost of copying exceeds the foregoing rates shall be established in advance by ordinance], and such special service charge shall be presumed to be reasonable. The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and object to [the] any fee or charge prior to it being incurred. d.   A custodian shall permit access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium or format requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium or format.  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the medium or format requested, the custodian [shall], at the custodians discretion, may either convert the record to the medium or format requested or provide a copy in some other meaningful medium or format.  [If a request is for a record: (1) in a medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both.]  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the electronic medium or format requested, the custodian shall be under no obligation to convert the record to the electronic medium or format requested but shall, at a minimum, provide a copy in the format maintained by the public agency. e.   Immediate access ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and public employee salary and overtime information.  Immediate access to government records shall not be required to be granted for documents over 12 months old. Government records shall be made available to the public on a publicly available website to the extent feasible.  A public agency may enter into shared services agreements for providing certain government records electronically. If the government record is readily available on a public agencys website, the custodian may require the requestor to obtain the record from the website, which shall contain a search bar feature on its home page.  The custodian shall provide the requestor with directions to assist in finding the record on the website, including providing the website URL address and the location on the website of the search bar, menu button, tab, link, landing page or equivalent, which contains the requested record.  1[The request shall be deemed fulfilled upon notification by the custodian to the requestor of the availability and location on the website of the requested information.]  If the requestor does not respond to the custodian within seven days of the custodian providing information about a record on the public agencys website, the request shall be deemed fulfilled. If, after the custodian has provided instructions on how to find a record on a public agencys website, the requestor is unable to find the record upon making a good faith effort to locate the record on the website, the requestor shall notify the custodian within seven days of the custodian providing the information.  Upon receiving such a request for assistance from a requestor, the custodian shall make a reasonable attempt to assist the requestor in finding the record on the website within seven days of the requestor notifying the custodian.1 f.    The custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall provide space for the name, address, email address and [phone] telephone number of the requestor and a brief description of the government record sought.  A request shall be submitted by a requestor in the form adopted by the custodian and the custodian may deny a request that is not submitted in the form adopted by the custodian. A request may be submitted anonymously provided, however, that anonymous requestors shall not be permitted to institute proceedings pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6). The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. All requests by a data broker or a requestor who is making a request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker shall be denied.  The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making the request on behalf of or for the use of a data broker, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. Data obtained through a records request shall not be sold. The form shall include space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when the record will be available, and the fees to be charged. The form shall also include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied.  The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through [an anonymous] a request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce. Custodians shall provide directions on how to submit requests for government records, including any required forms, on the public agencys website. Custodians shall be permitted to provide an electronic response to any electronic records request if government records are available electronically. g.   A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A public agency may make available to the public on its website an online form, portal, or software for transmitting requests electronically.   A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  [If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.]  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. A party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order in the legal proceeding or if compliance would otherwise be unreasonable, oppressive, or duplicative of already pending discovery request made in that legal proceeding, and a custodian shall not be required to complete such a request.  The requestor shall be required to certify whether the government record is being sought in connection with a legal proceeding and identify the proceeding for the request to be fulfilled. For purposes of this provision, a party to a legal proceeding shall include a party in interest, any attorney representing that party, and any person acting as an agent for or on behalf of that party. A custodian shall not be required to complete a request including for, but not limited to, mail, email, text messages, correspondence, or social media postings and messages, if the request does not identify specific individuals or accounts to be searched and is not confined to a discrete and limited time period and a specific subject matter, or if the custodian determines that the request would require research and the collection of information from the contents of government records and the creation of new government records setting forth that research and information. h.   Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record.  The request shall not be considered submitted until it is received by the custodian of records. i.    (1) Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, or 14 business days if the request is for a commercial purpose or if the records have to be reviewed by the public agency for the purpose of the agencys compliance with P.L.2020, c.125 (C.47:1B-1 et seq.), but the custodian shall notify the requestor of the additional response time within seven business days, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  The response time periods of seven or 14 business days, as established in this subsection, shall be an additional seven business days longer if the public agency is a fire district which employs one or fewer full-time employees who serve as custodians. In the event a records custodian is unable to fulfill a records request due to unforeseen circumstances or circumstances that otherwise reasonably necessitate additional time to fulfill the records request, the custodian shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of any response deadline and shall notify the requestor of the time extension within seven business days after receiving the request. In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number [, or other means of contacting the requestor].  If the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number, [or other means of contacting the requestor,] the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor [reappears before] contacts the custodian seeking a response to the original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven or 14 business days, as appropriate, after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available, which shall be no more than 21 business days from the date the requestor is so advised.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied. A public agency shall not be considered to be in possession of a public record that is created or maintained by another public agency and made available to the public agency either by remote access to a computer network or by distribution as a courtesy copy.  A records custodian of a public agency that receives a request for such a record, shall not be obligated to provide the record to the requestor and shall direct the requestor within seven business days to the public agency that, to the best of their knowledge, created or maintains the requested record, at which time the request shall be considered completed. The custodian shall not be required to complete an identical request for access to a government record from the same requestor if the information has not changed. A requestor shall have 14 business days to retrieve the government records following notice from the custodian that the request has been completed and the records are available. (2)  During a period declared pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for access to a government record within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, or as soon as possible thereafter. j.    A custodian shall [post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the] include information on the public agencys website and public records request form regarding a requestors right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record [by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof] and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed, which shall include the website address and toll-free information line phone number of the Government Records Council. k.   The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2023, c.113, s.2) 4.   Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.   A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor who is accurately identified by name, may, within 45 days of the date of denial: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodians decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judges knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or [agency head] Government Records Council shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding [shall] may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.  In determining whether to award attorneys fees, the court or the Government Records Council may consider whether the public agency is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or to have unreasonably denied access. If the records sought are produced by the public agency within seven business days of service of an action in Superior Court or a complaint before the Government Records Council, 1upon notification to the Superior Court or the Government Records Council,1 the matter shall be dismissed without prejudice and the requestor may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee if the custodian knew or should have known that the denial of access violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 5.   Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8. a.  (1)  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, [the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor]  who shall serve as Chair, and eight public members appointed as follows: four appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate 1, no more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party1 ; two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the President of the Senate 1, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party1 ; and two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the Speaker of the General Assembly 1, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party1.  Each public member shall serve for a term of five years and until a successor is appointed and qualified.

(3) A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected [or appointed] office [or employment] while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall [not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act] receive a salary equivalent to that provided by law for a public member of the Local Finance Board of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled [in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.] by appointment by the Governor, according to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, and for the remainder of the unexpired term.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.   The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied[;] .

The requestor shall have the opportunity to review and object to [the] any fee or charge prior to it being incurred. d.   A custodian shall permit access to a government record and provide a copy thereof in the medium or format requested if the public agency maintains the record in that medium or format.  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the medium or format requested, the custodian [shall], at the custodians discretion, may either convert the record to the medium or format requested or provide a copy in some other meaningful medium or format.  [If a request is for a record: (1) in a medium not routinely used by the agency; (2) not routinely developed or maintained by an agency; or (3) requiring a substantial amount of manipulation or programming of information technology, the agency may charge, in addition to the actual cost of duplication, a special charge that shall be reasonable and shall be based on the cost for any extensive use of information technology, or for the labor cost of personnel providing the service, that is actually incurred by the agency or attributable to the agency for the programming, clerical, and supervisory assistance required, or both.]  If the public agency does not maintain the record in the electronic medium or format requested, the custodian shall be under no obligation to convert the record to the electronic medium or format requested but shall, at a minimum, provide a copy in the format maintained by the public agency. e.   Immediate access ordinarily shall be granted to budgets, bills, vouchers, contracts, including collective negotiations agreements and individual employment contracts, and public employee salary and overtime information.  Immediate access to government records shall not be required to be granted for documents over 12 months old.

If the government record is readily available on a public agencys website, the custodian may require the requestor to obtain the record from the website, which shall contain a search bar feature on its home page.  The custodian shall provide the requestor with directions to assist in finding the record on the website, including providing the website URL address and the location on the website of the search bar, menu button, tab, link, landing page or equivalent, which contains the requested record.  1[The request shall be deemed fulfilled upon notification by the custodian to the requestor of the availability and location on the website of the requested information.]  If the requestor does not respond to the custodian within seven days of the custodian providing information about a record on the public agencys website, the request shall be deemed fulfilled. If, after the custodian has provided instructions on how to find a record on a public agencys website, the requestor is unable to find the record upon making a good faith effort to locate the record on the website, the requestor shall notify the custodian within seven days of the custodian providing the information.  Upon receiving such a request for assistance from a requestor, the custodian shall make a reasonable attempt to assist the requestor in finding the record on the website within seven days of the requestor notifying the custodian.1 f.    The custodian of a public agency shall adopt a form for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall provide space for the name, address, email address and [phone] telephone number of the requestor and a brief description of the government record sought.  A request shall be submitted by a requestor in the form adopted by the custodian and the custodian may deny a request that is not submitted in the form adopted by the custodian. A request may be submitted anonymously provided, however, that anonymous requestors shall not be permitted to institute proceedings pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6). The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. All requests by a data broker or a requestor who is making a request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker shall be denied.  The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making the request on behalf of or for the use of a data broker, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. Data obtained through a records request shall not be sold. The form shall include space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when the record will be available, and the fees to be charged. The form shall also include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied.  The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through [an anonymous] a request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce. Custodians shall provide directions on how to submit requests for government records, including any required forms, on the public agencys website. Custodians shall be permitted to provide an electronic response to any electronic records request if government records are available electronically. g.   A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A public agency may make available to the public on its website an online form, portal, or software for transmitting requests electronically.   A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  [If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.]  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. A party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order in the legal proceeding or if compliance would otherwise be unreasonable, oppressive, or duplicative of already pending discovery request made in that legal proceeding, and a custodian shall not be required to complete such a request.  The requestor shall be required to certify whether the government record is being sought in connection with a legal proceeding and identify the proceeding for the request to be fulfilled. For purposes of this provision, a party to a legal proceeding shall include a party in interest, any attorney representing that party, and any person acting as an agent for or on behalf of that party. A custodian shall not be required to complete a request including for, but not limited to, mail, email, text messages, correspondence, or social media postings and messages, if the request does not identify specific individuals or accounts to be searched and is not confined to a discrete and limited time period and a specific subject matter, or if the custodian determines that the request would require research and the collection of information from the contents of government records and the creation of new government records setting forth that research and information. h.   Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record.  The request shall not be considered submitted until it is received by the custodian of records. i.    (1) Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, or 14 business days if the request is for a commercial purpose or if the records have to be reviewed by the public agency for the purpose of the agencys compliance with P.L.2020, c.125 (C.47:1B-1 et seq.), but the custodian shall notify the requestor of the additional response time within seven business days, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  The response time periods of seven or 14 business days, as established in this subsection, shall be an additional seven business days longer if the public agency is a fire district which employs one or fewer full-time employees who serve as custodians. In the event a records custodian is unable to fulfill a records request due to unforeseen circumstances or circumstances that otherwise reasonably necessitate additional time to fulfill the records request, the custodian shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of any response deadline and shall notify the requestor of the time extension within seven business days after receiving the request. In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number [, or other means of contacting the requestor].  If the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number, [or other means of contacting the requestor,] the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor [reappears before] contacts the custodian seeking a response to the original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven or 14 business days, as appropriate, after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available, which shall be no more than 21 business days from the date the requestor is so advised.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied. A public agency shall not be considered to be in possession of a public record that is created or maintained by another public agency and made available to the public agency either by remote access to a computer network or by distribution as a courtesy copy.  A records custodian of a public agency that receives a request for such a record, shall not be obligated to provide the record to the requestor and shall direct the requestor within seven business days to the public agency that, to the best of their knowledge, created or maintains the requested record, at which time the request shall be considered completed. The custodian shall not be required to complete an identical request for access to a government record from the same requestor if the information has not changed. A requestor shall have 14 business days to retrieve the government records following notice from the custodian that the request has been completed and the records are available. (2)  During a period declared pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for access to a government record within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, or as soon as possible thereafter. j.    A custodian shall [post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the] include information on the public agencys website and public records request form regarding a requestors right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record [by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof] and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed, which shall include the website address and toll-free information line phone number of the Government Records Council. k.   The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2023, c.113, s.2) 4.   Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.   A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor who is accurately identified by name, may, within 45 days of the date of denial: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodians decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judges knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or [agency head] Government Records Council shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding [shall] may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.  In determining whether to award attorneys fees, the court or the Government Records Council may consider whether the public agency is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or to have unreasonably denied access. If the records sought are produced by the public agency within seven business days of service of an action in Superior Court or a complaint before the Government Records Council, 1upon notification to the Superior Court or the Government Records Council,1 the matter shall be dismissed without prejudice and the requestor may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee if the custodian knew or should have known that the denial of access violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 5.   Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8. a.  (1)  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, [the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor]  who shall serve as Chair, and eight public members appointed as follows: four appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate 1, no more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party1 ; two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the President of the Senate 1, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party1 ; and two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the Speaker of the General Assembly 1, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party1.  Each public member shall serve for a term of five years and until a successor is appointed and qualified.

(pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Governor shall directly appoint eight public members to the council, each of whom shall serve for a term of three years and until a successor is appointed and qualified, as follows: two from persons recommended by the President of the Senate, 1no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party;1 two from persons recommended by the Speaker of the General Assembly, 1no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party;1 and four appointed at the sole discretion of the Governor 1, no more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party1.  The terms of office of the members of the council serving on the date of enactment of P.L.    , c    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall expire upon the Governors direct appointment of the new members pursuant to this subsection. (3) A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected [or appointed] office [or employment] while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall [not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act] receive a salary equivalent to that provided by law for a public member of the Local Finance Board of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled [in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.] by appointment by the Governor, according to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, and for the remainder of the unexpired term.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.   The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied[;] .

The council shall periodically review the information and format of its website and make such adjustments as shall be deemed necessary to ensure that the information is clearly presented, accessible, and useful for the general public.  The council shall conduct such an initial review within six months following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.   At the request of the council, a public agency shall produce documents and ensure the attendance of witnesses with respect to the council's investigation of any complaint or the holding of any hearing. d.   Upon receipt of a written complaint signed by any person alleging that a custodian of a government record has improperly denied that person access to a government record, the council shall offer the parties the opportunity to resolve the dispute through mediation.  Mediation shall enable a person who has been denied access to a government record and the public agency that employs the records custodian who denied or failed to provide access thereto to attempt to mediate the dispute through a process whereby a neutral mediator, who shall be trained in mediation selected by the council, acts to encourage and facilitate the resolution of the dispute.  Mediation shall be an informal, nonadversarial process having the objective of helping the parties reach a mutually acceptable, voluntary agreement.  The mediator shall assist the parties in identifying issues, foster joint problem solving, and explore settlement alternatives. e.   If any party declines mediation or if mediation fails to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of all parties, the council shall initiate an investigation concerning the facts and circumstances set forth in the complaint.  The council shall make a determination as to whether the complaint is within its jurisdiction or frivolous or without any reasonable factual basis.  The council may assign staff attorneys to conduct the investigation, present findings, and make recommendations to the council.  If the council shall conclude that the complaint is outside its jurisdiction, frivolous, or without factual basis, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the public agency that employs the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  Otherwise, the council shall notify the public agency that employs the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed of the nature of the complaint and the facts and circumstances set forth therein.  The public agency that employs the records custodian shall have the opportunity to present the board with any statement or information concerning the complaint which the [custodian] agency wishes.  If the council is able to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the public agency that employs the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  If the council is unable to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, the council shall conduct a hearing on the matter in conformity with the rules and regulations provided for hearings by a State agency in contested cases under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), insofar as they may be applicable and practicable.  The council shall, by a majority vote of its members, render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented.  If the council determines, by a majority vote of its members, that a custodian [has] is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and [is found] to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the council may impose the penalties provided for in section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11) on the public agency that employs the custodian.  A decision of the council may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  Such appeals shall be filed within 30 days from the date the council renders a decision.  A decision of the council shall not have value as a precedent for any case initiated in Superior Court pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).  All proceedings of the council pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Beginning 18 months following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the council shall adjudicate all complaints that come before it within 90 days of the complaints filing, with the ability to extend for 30 days for good cause, exclusive of any time period during which the parties are engaged in a mediation process pursuant to this section.  The council shall make such organizational adjustments and modify its procedures as it deems necessary to ensure that complaints are adjudicated in such a timeframe. f.    The council shall not charge any party a fee in regard to actions filed with the council.  The council shall be subject to the provisions of the "Open Public Meetings Act," P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6), except that the council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.  [A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.] g.   The council shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial or Legislative Branches of State Government or any agency, officer, or employee of those branches. (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.8) 6.    Section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  [A] If a public official, officer, employee, or custodian [who] is found to have knowingly and willfully [violates] violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and [is found] to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the public agency that employs the custodian, officer, employee, or official shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for an initial violation, $2,500 for a second violation that occurs within 10 years of an initial violation, and $5,000 for a third violation that occurs within 10 years of an initial violation.  [This penalty]  The penalties authorized pursuant to this subsection may be imposed by the courts or by the Government Records Council. b.    A requestor who is found to have sold the data obtained by a records request, who is found to have intentionally failed to certify that a records request is for a commercial purpose, who is a data broker, or who is making the request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, and is found to have intentionally certified that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making the request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker, shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 for the first offense, $2,500 for the second offense, and $5,000 for each subsequent offense.  The penalties may be imposed by the courts. c.     These penalties shall be collected and enforced in proceedings in accordance with the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), and the rules of court governing actions for the collection of civil penalties.  The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction of proceedings for the collection and enforcement of the penalty imposed by this section. d.    Appropriate disciplinary proceedings may be initiated against a public official, officer, employee or custodian against whom a penalty has been imposed.
