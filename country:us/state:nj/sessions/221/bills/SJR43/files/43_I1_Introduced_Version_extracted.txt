STATEMENT This joint resolution designates February 4th of each year as Women and Girls in Sports Day. Opportunities in sports were traditionally open to only men and women were discouraged from participating in and taking an interest in sports. The 20th and 21st centuries saw women strive to increasingly participate in sports, however gender disparities continue to exist as less support and resources are provided to womens sports in comparison to mens sports. This lack of investment has led to issues such as pay disparities and the unequal allocation of facilities and equipment for womens sports. In spite of these inequalities, women have contributed significantly to sports and inspiring athletes such as New Jersey natives Carli Lloyd and Laurie Hernandez make excellent role models to fans of all ages and genders. Women and girls deserve recognition for their contributions to sports and an awareness of their fight for gender equality. It should be further acknowledged that sports are essential in the lives of girls because participation in sports teach important life skills, which later empower them as women to stand up against gender inequalities both in sports and in their daily lives. Physical activity is necessary for good overall health and sports are important because they encourage women and girls to become and remain physically active.
