The reexamination report shall state: a.     The major problems and objectives relating to land development in the municipality at the time of the adoption of the last reexamination report. b.    The extent to which such problems and objectives have been reduced or have increased subsequent to such date. c.     The extent to which there have been significant changes in the assumptions, policies, and objectives forming the basis for the master plan or development regulations as last revised, with particular regard to the density and distribution of population and land uses, housing conditions, circulation, conservation of natural resources, energy conservation, collection, disposition, and recycling of designated recyclable materials, and changes in State, county and municipal policies and objectives. d.    The specific changes recommended for the master plan or development regulations, if any, including underlying objectives, policies and standards, or whether a new plan or regulations should be prepared. e.     The recommendations of the planning board concerning the incorporation of redevelopment plans adopted pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) into the land use plan element of the municipal master plan, and recommended changes, if any, in the local development regulations necessary to effectuate the redevelopment plans of the municipality. f.     The recommendations of the planning board concerning locations appropriate for the development of public electric vehicle infrastructure, including but not limited to, commercial districts, areas proximate to public transportation and transit facilities and transportation corridors, and public rest stops; and recommended changes, if any, in the local development regulations necessary or appropriate for the development of public electric vehicle infrastructure. g.    The recommendations of the planning board concerning locations appropriate for the development of warehouses may be consistent and compatible with one or more model buffer ordinances to be applicable to lots on or near the boundaries between different zoning districts for the siting of warehouses adopted by the State Planning Commission pursuant to subsection d. of section 4 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-199).  As used in this subsection, "warehouse" means a building that stores cargo, goods, or products of any type on a short-term or long-term basis for later distribution to wholesale or retail customers, and includes, but is not limited to, a distribution center, flex-warehouse, or any other type of warehouse. (cf: P.L.2019, c.267, s.2) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately, and the State Planning Commission shall, no later than the first day of the seventh month next following enactment, adopt at least one model buffer ordinance for the siting of warehouses, as required pursuant to subsection d. of section 4 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-199). STATEMENT This bill requires the State Planning Commission to prepare and adopt model buffer ordinances to be applicable to lots on or near the boundaries between different zoning districts detailing different regulatory options for the siting of warehouses, including design and setbacks.  The bill also allows municipal master plans and zoning ordinances to be consistent and compatible with one or more of those model buffer ordinances.
