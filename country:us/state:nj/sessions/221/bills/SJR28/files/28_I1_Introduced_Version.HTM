STATEMENT This joint resolution designates the second weekend in September as Salute to Service and Sacrifice Weekend. The joint resolution recognizes New Jerseys fallen members of the police, firefighting, and emergency medical service professions. Since record keeping began, New Jersey has lost over 600 firefighters and 500 police officers to line-of-duty deaths. For emergency medical service professionals, line of duty deaths is harder to count and still being assessed with respect to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This joint resolution calls upon public officials and residents of New Jersey to observe the second weekend of September each year with appropriate activities and programs.
