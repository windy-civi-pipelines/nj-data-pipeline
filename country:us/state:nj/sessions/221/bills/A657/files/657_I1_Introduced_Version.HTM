<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Tourism is an extremely
important component of New Jerseys economy, and it is necessary for the
Legislature to ensure that the Division of Travel and Tourism in the Department
of State operates in a manner that maximizes the States opportunity to attract
tourists from as wide a market area as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    New Jersey has many
assets in a number of tourism sectors that make it an attractive destination,
including unique historic, performing arts, cultural, retail, professional
sports, and recreational tourism assets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In addition, New
Jerseys proximity to major metropolitan areas, including New York and
Philadelphia, make it an attractive and more affordable location for tourists,
particularly those from out of State and from other countries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is essential for the
division to explore new markets, especially those in states not contiguous to
New Jersey, and particularly foreign markets, to promote the State as an
attractive alternative to other locations, promoting such assets as the States
shore area compared to other states such as Florida, North Carolina, and South
Carolina, and the advantage of the States proximity to other tourist
destinations on the east coast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New sections)  There is
established an Office of Tourism Research in the Division of Travel and Tourism
in the Department of State to coordinate and undertake ongoing research on the
travel and tourism market. This research shall support and inform the tourism
marketing activities routinely undertaken by the division and the tourism
industry in this State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     As a main component of
research, the office shall, in cooperation with members of the tourism,
hospitality, and travel industries, establish a database of potential
travelers, including group travel organizations and tour operators. The database
may also incorporate and draw upon any other appropriate data source, including
census data, deemed useful by the division.  In order to maximize the
effectiveness of the marketing activities routinely undertaken by the division
and the tourism industry, the research shall identify potential travelers by
type, including age, interests, multicultural factors, travel interests, and
travel goals, and also identify core geographic targets for New Jersey's
marketing activities. The database shall be designed to incorporate those
attributes for a domestic population base within a minimum of a 500 mile radius
of the borders of the State. The database shall be developed in a format that
would facilitate its use in connection with a marketing plan to identify
primary target audiences for:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   general statewide
travel;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   regional travel,
including travel to lesser known portions of the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   seasonal travel; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   specialized travel
interests in the various tourism sectors identified by the office pursuant to
subsection c. of this section, including specialized short term weekend stays
and family travel opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The office shall also
develop an appropriate methodology to conduct an ongoing survey of the
effectiveness of New Jersey's travel and tourism marketing and media
activities, including the branding of the State as a tourism destination, and
consumer satisfaction and awareness of New Jersey as a tourist destination. The
research shall provide for the regular documentation of standard tourism
indicators, including hotel occupancy rates, room rates, rental activity,
seasonal fluctuation per travel sector or region, State park visitation rates,
utilization of the top 15 tourism attractions in the State, and utilization of
the State's visitor centers.  The division may contract with a consulting
organization or organizations to establish the underlying research methodology
and instrument, and to conduct, update, and interpret the research. The office
and the division shall ensure that there is no duplication between the research
conducted pursuant to this subsection and the survey required to be annually
commissioned by the council to be conducted by the New Jersey Center for
Hospitality and Tourism at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey pursuant to
subsection h. of section 10 of P.L.1977, c.225 (C.34:1A-54).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The office shall
develop a comprehensive survey of the States tourism assets, and shall
identify and organize tourist attractions in the State by tourism sector. Such
sectors may include, but may not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   heritage tourism,
including colonial or Revolutionary War venues, historic towns and villages,
sites related to the early Industrial Revolution in America, historic urban
sites, and maritime and military history;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   amusements and
entertainment, which shall include cultural events, festivals, exhibits, theme
parks, museums, and gaming;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   attractions based on
scenic beauty, including State parks;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   sports and outdoors
tourism, including professional and semi-professional sports and family
sporting opportunities such as water sports, fishing, skiing, and hiking;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   retail tourism,
including business districts of unusual or specialized interest and venues
featuring specialized retailing, including but not limited to, antiques and
outlet shopping;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   agricultural, food, and
beverage tourism, including agricultural museums, farm tours, hayrides, and
sites of agricultural interest, which may also include, in connection with the
Department of Agriculture, promotion of New Jersey agricultural products,
including New Jersey grown or processed comestibles, the New Jersey nursery
industry, including specialty nurseries, and New Jersey restaurants, wineries,
breweries, and distilleries; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   the meetings and convention
market.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  The
Division of Travel and Tourism shall contract with outside marketing experts,
after a competitive process for their selection, for the purpose of
