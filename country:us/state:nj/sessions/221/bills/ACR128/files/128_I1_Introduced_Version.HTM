(cf: Art.VIII, Sec.II, par.4, effective December 8, 2016) 2. When this proposed amendment to the Constitution is finally agreed to pursuant to Article IX, paragraph 1 of the Constitution, it shall be submitted to the people at the next general election occurring more than three months after the final agreement and shall be published at least once in at least one newspaper of each county designated by the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Secretary of State, not less than three months prior to the general election. 3. This proposed amendment to the Constitution shall be submitted to the people at that election in the following manner and form: There shall be printed on each official ballot to be used at the general election, the following: a. In every municipality in which voting machines are not used, a legend which shall immediately precede the question as follows: If you favor the proposition printed below make a cross (X), plus (+), or check (a) in the square opposite the word "Yes." If you are opposed thereto make a cross (X), plus (+) or check (a) in the square opposite the word "No." b. In every municipality the following question: CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT DEDICATING FUNDS FOR STATE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM YES Do you approve amending the State Constitution to dedicate certain revenues to the States transportation trust fund account?    The transportation trust fund account is an account in the States General Fund that contains funds used only for the planning, construction, and repair of the transportation system in this State. This amendment dedicates an amount equal to the amount annually collected from a tax imposed on the sale of electric vehicles, up to $100 million, to the transportation trust fund account.  The dedication would only occur during a fiscal year where there is a tax imposed on the sale of electric vehicles. This amendment also dedicates an amount equal to the amount annually collected from an additional fee imposed on the registration of electric vehicles to the transportation trust fund account.  The dedication would only occur during a fiscal year where there is an additional fee imposed on the registration of electric vehicles. The dedicated funds would be used annually to support the transportation system in this State. The amendment would not impose a new sales tax or additional registration fee on electric vehicles. Rather, if the State enacts a sales tax or registration fee on electric vehicles, the amendment would require certain amount of revenue collected from the tax or fee to be used for transportation purposes. INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO This amendment dedicates certain amounts of revenues from a tax imposed on the sale of electric vehicles, and from an additional fee imposed on the registration of electric vehicles, to the transportation trust fund account.  The transportation trust fund account is an account in the States General Fund that contains funds used only for the planning, construction, and repair of the transportations system in this State. If the State imposes a tax on the sale of electric vehicles, the amendment requires that an amount equal to the amount annually collected from the tax, up to $100 million, be credited to the account. If the State imposes an additional fee on the registration of electric vehicles, the amendment requires that an amount equal to the amount annually collected from the fee be credited to the account. The amendment requires that the funds credited to the account be dedicated solely for transportation purposes. The amendment would not require the State to impose a sales tax on electric vehicles. The amendment would not require the State to impose an additional registration fee on electric vehicles. The amendment would not change the standard registration fees imposed on all motor vehicles. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution would amend the State Constitution to dedicate certain additional revenues to the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF).  As required under the State Constitution, all revenues deposited into the TTF may only be used to support the cost of planning, acquisition, engineering, construction, reconstruction, repair and rehabilitation of the transportation system in this State. Specifically, during any fiscal year in which a tax is imposed under the Sales and Use Tax Act on receipts from the sale of electric vehicles, this constitutional amendment would require an amount equivalent to the amount annually derived from the tax, up to $100 million, be deposited into the TTF.  Additionally, during any fiscal year in which an additional motor vehicle registration fee is imposed on electric vehicles, this constitutional amendment would require an amount equivalent to the amount of revenue annually derived from the additional registration fee be deposited into the TTF. This constitutional amendment would not require the State to impose a new tax or fee on electric vehicles, nor would it change the standard registration fee that is currently imposed on non-electric motor vehicles.  Rather, if the State were to impose a sales tax on electric vehicles or an additional registration fee on electric vehicles, the amendment would require certain amounts of these revenues to be used for transportation purposes.
