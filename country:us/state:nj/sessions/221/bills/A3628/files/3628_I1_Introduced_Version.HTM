treatment.  The bill requires that an assessment be performed prior to the
performance of routine laboratory and diagnostic testing.  If, as a result of
the assessment, involuntary commitment to treatment seems necessary, then the
routine laboratory and diagnostic testing is to be performed.  (Laboratory and
diagnostic testing may currently be completed and submitted to screening
services before the assessment, so this bill seeks to avoid such testing
expenses if the person does not need commitment, and to reduce hospital
emergency room waiting times because staff would not have to wait for test
results to be reviewed before the assessment is performed.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill amends
the definition of &quot;mental health screener&quot; to refer to regulations
adopted by the Department of Human Services concerning &quot;certified
screeners&quot; at N.J.A.C.10:31-3.3, and clarifies that the definition of this
term includes any person who meets the criteria for certification as a mental
health screener prescribed by regulation of the Commissioner of Human
Services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill specifies
that it does not alter the requirements of section 1 of P.L.2009, c.242
(C.30:4-177.61) concerning the use of standardized admission protocols and
medical clearance criteria for transfer or admission of a hospital emergency
department patient to a State or county psychiatric hospital or a short-term
