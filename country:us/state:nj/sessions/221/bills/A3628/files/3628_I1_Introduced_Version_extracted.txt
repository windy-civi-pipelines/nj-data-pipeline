The screening service may provide emergency and consensual treatment to the person receiving the assessment and may transport the person or detain the person up to 24 hours for the purposes of providing the treatment and conducting the assessment. b.    [When a person is assessed] The assessment shall be performed by a mental health screener [and] prior to the performance of routine laboratory and diagnostic testing pursuant to section 1 or 2 of P.L.2009, c.242 (C.30:4-177.61 or C.9:3A-7.4), as appropriate. If, as a result of the assessment, involuntary commitment to treatment seems necessary, the routine laboratory and diagnostic testing shall be performed and the screener shall provide, on a screening document prescribed by the division, information regarding the person's history and available alternative facilities and services that are deemed inappropriate for the person.  When appropriate and available, and as permitted by law, the screener shall make reasonable efforts to gather information from the person's family or significant others for the purposes of preparing the screening document. If a psychiatrist, in consideration of this document and in conjunction with the psychiatrist's own complete assessment, concludes that the person is in need of commitment to treatment, the psychiatrist shall complete the screening certificate.  The screening certificate shall be completed by a psychiatrist except in those circumstances where the division's contract with the screening service provides that another physician may complete the certificate. Upon completion of the screening certificate, screening service staff shall determine, in consultation with the psychiatrist or another physician, as appropriate, the least restrictive environment for the appropriate treatment to which the person shall be assigned or admitted, taking into account the person's prior history of hospitalization and treatment and the person's current mental health condition.  Screening service staff shall designate: (1)   inpatient treatment for the person if he is immediately or imminently dangerous or if outpatient treatment is deemed inadequate to render the person unlikely to be dangerous to self, others, or property within the reasonably foreseeable future; and (2)   outpatient treatment for the person when outpatient treatment is deemed sufficient to render the person unlikely to be dangerous to self, others, or property within the reasonably foreseeable future. If the screening service staff determines that the person is in need of involuntary commitment to outpatient treatment, the screening service staff shall consult with an outpatient treatment provider to arrange, if possible, for an appropriate interim plan of outpatient treatment in accordance with section 9 of P.L.2009, c.112 (C.30:4-27.8a). If a person has been admitted three times or has been an inpatient for 60 days at a short-term care facility during the preceding 12 months, consideration shall be given to not placing the person in a short-term care facility. The person shall be admitted to the appropriate facility or assigned to the appropriate outpatient treatment provider, as appropriate for treatment, as soon as possible.  Screening service staff are authorized to coordinate initiation of outpatient treatment or transport the person or arrange for transportation of the person to the appropriate facility. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to alter the requirements of section 1 of P.L.2009, c.242 (C.30:4-177.61) concerning the use of standardized admission protocols and medical clearance criteria for transfer or admission of a hospital emergency department patient to a State or county psychiatric hospital or a short-term care facility. c.     If the mental health screener determines that the person is not in need of assignment or commitment to an outpatient treatment provider, or admission or commitment to a short-term care facility, psychiatric facility, or special psychiatric hospital, the screener shall refer the person to an appropriate community mental health or social services agency or appropriate professional or inpatient care in a psychiatric unit of a general hospital. d.    A mental health screener shall make a screening outreach visit if the screener determines, based on clinically relevant information provided by an individual with personal knowledge of the person subject to screening, that the person may need involuntary commitment to treatment and the person is unwilling or unable to come to the screening service for an assessment. e.     If the mental health screener pursuant to this assessment determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a person is in need of involuntary commitment to treatment, the screener shall so certify the need on a form prepared by the division. (cf: P.L.2009, c.112, s.5) 3.    The Commissioner of Human Services, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et sq.), shall adopt rules and regulations as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this act. 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Human  Services shall take such anticipatory administrative action in advance thereof as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill amends the mental health screening law, P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4D-27.1 et seq.), concerning assessments of persons believed to be in need of involuntary commitment to treatment.  The bill requires that an assessment be performed prior to the performance of routine laboratory and diagnostic testing.  If, as a result of the assessment, involuntary commitment to treatment seems necessary, then the routine laboratory and diagnostic testing is to be performed.  (Laboratory and diagnostic testing may currently be completed and submitted to screening services before the assessment, so this bill seeks to avoid such testing expenses if the person does not need commitment, and to reduce hospital emergency room waiting times because staff would not have to wait for test results to be reviewed before the assessment is performed.) In addition, the bill amends the definition of "mental health screener" to refer to regulations adopted by the Department of Human Services concerning "certified screeners" at N.J.A.C.10:31-3.3, and clarifies that the definition of this term includes any person who meets the criteria for certification as a mental health screener prescribed by regulation of the Commissioner of Human Services. Lastly, the bill specifies that it does not alter the requirements of section 1 of P.L.2009, c.242 (C.30:4-177.61) concerning the use of standardized admission protocols and medical clearance criteria for transfer or admission of a hospital emergency department patient to a State or county psychiatric hospital or a short-term care facility.

STATEMENT This bill amends the mental health screening law, P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4D-27.1 et seq.), concerning assessments of persons believed to be in need of involuntary commitment to treatment.  The bill requires that an assessment be performed prior to the performance of routine laboratory and diagnostic testing.  If, as a result of the assessment, involuntary commitment to treatment seems necessary, then the routine laboratory and diagnostic testing is to be performed.  (Laboratory and diagnostic testing may currently be completed and submitted to screening services before the assessment, so this bill seeks to avoid such testing expenses if the person does not need commitment, and to reduce hospital emergency room waiting times because staff would not have to wait for test results to be reviewed before the assessment is performed.) In addition, the bill amends the definition of "mental health screener" to refer to regulations adopted by the Department of Human Services concerning "certified screeners" at N.J.A.C.10:31-3.3, and clarifies that the definition of this term includes any person who meets the criteria for certification as a mental health screener prescribed by regulation of the Commissioner of Human Services. Lastly, the bill specifies that it does not alter the requirements of section 1 of P.L.2009, c.242 (C.30:4-177.61) concerning the use of standardized admission protocols and medical clearance criteria for transfer or admission of a hospital emergency department patient to a State or county psychiatric hospital or a short-term care facility.
