This bill waives the 15-day waiting periods in the case of a patient who, based on reasonable medical certainty, is not expected to survive for 15 days.  The attending physician will be required to document the medical basis for the determination that the patient is not expected to survive for 15 days.  The bill retains the 48-hour waiting period between submission of a written request and the issuance of a prescription for medical aid in dying medication.
