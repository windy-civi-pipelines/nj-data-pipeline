<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises the
definition of harassment, intimidation or bullying under the Anti-Bullying
Bill of Rights Act.  Under that law, the term harassment, intimidation or
bullying is defined as any gesture, action, or electronic communication that
is reasonably perceived as being motivated either by any actual or perceived
characteristic, such as race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin,
gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, or a mental,
physical or sensory disability, or by any other distinguishing characteristic.
This bill revises the definition to clarify that hazing constitutes harassment,
intimidation, or bullying under the law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the State Board of
Educations regulations provide that a school districts policy prohibiting
harassment, intimidation, or bullying can include a statement that bullying is
unwanted, aggressive behavior that may involve a real or perceived power
imbalance.  This bill recognizes the power imbalance in harassment,
intimidation, or bullying incidents and requires that each school districts
policy include a statement that harassment, intimidation, or bullying is
unwanted, aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power
imbalance.  Additionally, this bill requires the Department of Education to
revise its model policy and guidance document to reflect the power imbalance between
aggressors and victims as it applies to incidents of harassment, intimidation,
or bullying in public schools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, current law
requires each public school teacher to complete two hours of instruction on
harassment, intimidation, or bullying in each professional development period. 
This bill increases the professional development requirement from two to five
hours.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill requires
the department to provide professional development opportunities related to
harassment, intimidation, and bullying prevention, the prevalence of
harassment, intimidation, and bullying during school and school-sponsored
athletic activities, and tools for creating a positive school climate and
culture.  This professional development is to be made available at no cost to
all public school teachers.  Under the bill, the department is to consult with
the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, the New Jersey
School Boards Association, and recognized experts in school bullying from a
cross section of academia, child advocacy organizations, nonprofit
organizations, professional associations, and government agencies, to develop or
identify these professional development opportunities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bills provisions
implement certain recommendations of the report from the New Jersey
Anti-Bullying Task Force, dated December 28, 2023.</p>
