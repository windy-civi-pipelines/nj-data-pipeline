In FY 2024, the State estimates that the 0.53 percent assessment will generate approximately $157 million in total revenue dedicated to the Health Care Subsidy Fund.  This fund supports State expenditures to subsidize federally qualified health centers, charity care, NJ FamilyCare, and other health care programs.
