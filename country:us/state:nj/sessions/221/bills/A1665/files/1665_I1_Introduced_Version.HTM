P.L.1947, c.262.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of the
State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      1.   New
section a.  As used in this section, graduated nursing student means a person
who has graduated from an accredited nurse training program that offers a
diploma, associates degree, baccalaureate degree, or advanced degree in
nursing but has not yet met the requirements for licensure as a licensed
practical nurse or registered nurse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board may issue a
temporary graduate nursing license to a graduated nursing student who submits
an application for temporary licensure on a form and in a manner provided by
the board.  The board may assess application and licensure fees for a temporary
graduate nursing license, which fees shall not exceed the fees assessed by the
board for licensure of registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  Unless granted an
extension pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, a temporary graduate
nurse license issued under this section shall be valid for one year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   At least 90 days prior
to the expiration date of a temporary graduate nurse license, the graduated nursing
student shall initiate the process of applying for licensure as a registered
nurse or a licensed practical nurse, as applicable, including registering for
the applicable licensure examination, initiating the process of completing a
criminal history record background check, and submitting the required fees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The board may authorize
an extension of a temporary graduate nurse license for up to one year on the
basis of illness or extreme hardship, provided the graduated nursing student
submits an application for extension at least 60 days prior to the expiration
of the license that includes a detailed, written explanation of the reason the
extension is requested.  If requesting an extension due to illness, the
applicant shall provide certification of the illness from the applicants
treating health care provider. In no case shall the board grant an extension to
a graduated nursing student who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2)
of this subsection.  An individual issued a temporary graduate nurse license
shall be granted no more than one extension pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A temporary graduate
nurse license shall immediately expire if the graduated nursing student fails
the applicable licensing examination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A graduated nursing
student shall not practice under a temporary graduate nurse license except when
under the supervision of a licensed registered nurse who is physically present
in the area where the graduated nursing student is practicing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2. Section 4 of P.L.1947,
c.262 (C.45:11-26) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  Qualifications of
applicants.    An applicant for a license to practice professional nursing
shall submit to the board evidence in such form as the board may prescribe that
said applicant:  (1) [has attained his or her eighteenth birthday] is at least
18 years of age; (2) is of good moral character, is not a habitual user of
drugs, and has never been convicted or has not pleaded nolo contendere, non
vult contendere, or non vult to an indictment, information, or complaint
alleging a violation of any [Federal] federal or State law relating to narcotic
drugs; (3) holds a diploma from an accredited [4] four-year high school or the
equivalent thereof as determined by the New Jersey State Department of
Education; (4) has completed a course of professional nursing study in an
accredited school of professional  nursing as defined by the board and holds a
diploma therefrom.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding anything
herein contained, any person who possesses the educational and school of
professional nursing qualifications for registration required by the law of
this State at the time of [his or her] the persons graduation from an
accredited school of professional nursing shall be deemed to possess the
qualifications (3) and (4) prescribed hereinabove in this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding anything
herein contained, any person who shall have qualifications (1) and (2) and
shall have graduated from a school of professional nursing, which need not be
an accredited school, shall be deemed to have qualifications (3) and (4) upon
complying with such reasonable requirements as to high school and school of
nursing studies and training as the board may prescribe; provided, however,
that such person shall make application in form prescribed by the board within
[1] one year from the effective date of this act and shall satisfactorily
complete such reasonable requirements and successfully pass the examinations,
which examinations shall be limited to  subject matters in the curriculum
required by the board at the time of the applicant's graduation, provided for
in subsection b. hereof, within [2] two years after the date of the filing of
such application.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  License.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) By examination.  The
applicant shall be required to pass a written examination in such subjects as
the board may determine, which examination may be supplemented by an oral or
practical examination or both.  Upon successfully passing such examinations the
applicant shall be licensed by the board to practice professional nursing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) By indorsement without
examination.  The board may issue a license to practice professional nursing
without examination to an applicant who has been duly licensed or registered as
a registered or professional nurse by examination or by original waiver under
the laws of another State, territory or possession of the United States, or the
District of Columbia, or any foreign country, if in the opinion of the board
the applicant has the qualifications required by this act for the licensing of
