<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The officer shall be
entitled to counsel by an attorney, or representation by any other person whom
the officer chooses, such as an employee representative, or both, immediately
before and during the entire period of any questioning, unless the officer
consents in writing to being questioned without the presence of counsel or an
employee representative.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    During the course of any
questioning session, the officer shall be afforded the opportunity to consult
privately with counsel, an employee representative, or both, if such
consultation does not repeatedly and unnecessarily disrupt the questioning
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the counsel or
representative of the officer is not available within 24 hours of the time set
for the commencement of any questioning, the officer shall be afforded a
reasonable extension of time, not to exceed 72 hours, to obtain counsel or
representation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The questioning of an
officer under investigation shall be conducted at a reasonable time when the
officer is on duty, unless exigent circumstances compel more immediate
questioning, or the officer agrees in writing to being questioned at a
different time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Unless the officer
consents in writing to being questioned elsewhere, the questioning of an
officer under investigation shall be conducted at the office of the officer or
department, commission or agency official conducting the investigation or at
the place where the officer under investigation reports for duty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    No threat against, false
or misleading statement to, harassment of, or promise of reward to an officer
under investigation shall be made to induce the officer to answer any question,
give any statement or otherwise provide information; provided, however, an
officer under investigation may be advised that he may be subject to
disciplinary action, including termination, if he has received a written grant
of immunity and affirmation that the statement given by the officer under
immunity shall not be used in any subsequent criminal proceeding against that
officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    All questioning of an
officer under investigation shall be recorded in full, either electronically or
stenographically, and a copy of the transcript shall be provided to the officer
under investigation before any subsequent period of questioning or the filing
of any charge against that officer.  An officer under investigation may
independently record all questioning.  If the department, commission or agency
or the officer conducting the questioning so requests, the officer under investigation
shall provide a copy of that recording to the requesting party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     No officer under
investigation shall be compelled to take or submit to a lie detector test as
part of that investigation.</p>

as part of an investigation shall be subject to a chain of custody sufficient
to establish it has not been substituted, tampered with, replaced or altered.

substituted, tampered with, replaced or altered shall not be used against any
officer, nor shall any record of, or reference to, that evidence be made part
of the officer's personnel file.</p>

discontinued and the investigator shall forthwith notify the Attorney General
or the county prosecutor, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the Attorney General
or county prosecutor, as the case may be, grants immunity, the investigator
shall so advise the subject officer in writing.  The investigator, orally and
in writing, shall also advise the subject officer that the immunity applies
solely to any criminal offense, not any departmental or administrative hearings
or actions and, further, that a failure on the part of the subject officer to
fully cooperate in the affected administrative investigation, interview or
interrogation may result in disciplinary charges, including termination for
cause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The advisory information
required in writing under this subsection shall be recorded on a form which the
subject officer shall sign in front of two witnesses, who also shall sign the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, to be known as the
&quot;State Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights,&quot; establishes
specific rights, privileges and protections for State law enforcement officers,
including State correction officers who are subject to charges which, after
investigation, might lead to disciplinary hearings and actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets time frames for
the commencement of investigations of complaints.  If the complaint is
initiated by a private citizen or inmate, the investigation must begin within
15 days of the date the complaint is received.  If the complaint is brought by
the department, commission or agency employing the officer, a disciplinary
hearing must be scheduled no less than 10 days, or more than 30 days, from the
date the complaint was served on the officer.  Violations of departmental,
commission or agency rules or regulations must be filed no more than 45 days after
the day on which the person filing the charge reasonably becomes aware of the
violation.  A complaint must be dismissed if it is not filed within these time
frames.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Among the procedural rights
and protections State law enforcement officers are afforded under this bill
are:  (1) notice of the nature and scope of the investigation or charges; (2)
24-hour advance notice before an officer subject to investigation may be
questioned; (3) right to counsel, or an employee representative, during
questioning; (4) records of all questioning periods; and (5) assurance that no
officer is required to submit to a lie detector test as part of any
investigation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Charges must be filed within
30 days of the conclusion of any investigation.  A failure to comply with this
requirement will result in the dismissal of all charges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No disciplinary action may be
taken against an officer until that officer has been afforded a hearing. 
Notwithstanding that requirement, an officer who is charged with a crime, and
who is found to be unfit for duty or is a danger to any person if permitted to
remain on the job, may be suspended without a hearing.  An officer may also be
suspended without a hearing if he is formally charged with a crime or if
immediate suspension is needed to maintain the safety, health or order of the
department, commission or agency employing the officer.  An officer who is
formally charged with a crime is to be suspended without pay.  If, however, he
is found not guilty, the charges are dismissed or the prosecution is
terminated, that officer is to receive all back pay within 30 days of that
disposition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the disciplinary hearing
officer finds or determines that a charged officer is not guilty:  (1) the
matter is deemed concluded and all charges are dismissed; (2) no disciplinary
action may be taken against the officer; (3) no record of, or reference to, the
