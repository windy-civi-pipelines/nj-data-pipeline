STATEMENT Fishing, hunting, trapping, and the harvesting of fish and wildlife are a valued part of the States heritage.  This constitutional amendment would preserve the right of the people to fish, hunt, trap, and harvest fish and wildlife.  The amendment would also require that fish and wildlife be managed by laws and regulations that provide persons with the continued opportunity to take, by traditional means and methods, species traditionally pursued by fishermen, hunters, and trappers. Fish and wildlife management would be required to be consistent with both the State's duty to protect its sporting heritage and its duty to conserve fish and wildlife.  The amendment would also require that fishing, hunting, trapping, and the harvesting of fish and wildlife, by traditional means and methods, be a preferred and available way of controlling all invasive or overpopulated species.
