circumstances where sex is a bona fide occupational qualification, reasonably
necessary to the normal operation of the particular business or enterprise;
provided further that nothing herein contained shall be construed to bar an

immediately before retirement, is employed in a bona fide executive or a high
policy-making position, if that employee is entitled to an immediate

of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy
day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief,
unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it
is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or
practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall
not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during
hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be
applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an
accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q.

refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this
subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely
held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer
to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place
of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement
of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a
reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of
employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall,
wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by
an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time,
or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than
sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by
the employer of that person as leave taken without pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) (a) For purposes of this

of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of
retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to
another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   The number of
individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held
religious observance or practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)   For an employer with
multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or
administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the
accommodation more difficult or expensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   An accommodation shall
be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the
inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in
which he or she is employed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   (i) The provisions of
this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of
religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship
or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   This subsection q.
shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of
attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the
employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph
(d) shall be upon the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.     For any employer to
take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or
disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer
from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information
regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation,
including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of
the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national
origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the
employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as
a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a
waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree,
not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee
herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any
authorized representative of the other employee or former employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     s.     For an employer to
treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer
knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner
less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or
breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition,
an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make
available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as
bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance
with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary
transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the
pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the
accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child,
the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee
and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall,
in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for
the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation
would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The
employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or
privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace
accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave
provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be
provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to
other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their
ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as
otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or
unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section &quot;pregnancy or breastfeeding&quot; means pregnancy, childbirth, and
breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from
childbirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the
employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking
into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity
requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     For an employer to pay
any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of
compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the
employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for
substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and
responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the
characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education
or experience, or the quantity or quality of production;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the factor or
factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   That each of the factors
is applied reasonably;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   That one or more of the
factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   That the factors are
job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate
business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it
is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve
the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Comparisons of wage rates
shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. 
For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;member of a protected class&quot;
means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed,
color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union
status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic
information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or
atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for
service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits
an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or

compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DDEI) as a new principal
department within the Executive Branch.  The bill specifies the commissioner of
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is appointed by the Governor with advice and
consent of the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor during the
Governors term of office.  The commissioner serves as the administrator and
chief executive officer of the DDEI.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The functions, powers, and
duties of the commissioner are set forth in this bill and will include
consulting and assisting on efforts by the Director of the Division of
Investment in the Department of Treasury to attempt to use underrepresented
financial businesses to provide brokerage and investment management services; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     consulting and assisting on
diversity, equity, and inclusion in investments by the State, and its political
subdivisions, in the allocation of loans and grants for business formation, and
in the provision of low interest loans and down payment support for homeowners;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     consulting and assisting on
diversity, equity, and inclusion in procurement by the State and its political
subdivisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill transfers certain
State offices, units, and responsibilities to the DDEI.  The functions, powers,
and duties of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Small Business
Registration and Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Certification
Services Unit in the Department of the Treasury would be transferred to the
DDEI.  Additionally, the DDEI would be responsible for the operation and
continued development of the central registry, known as the Selective
Assistance Vendor Information (SAVI II) database, which lists businesses
certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State set-aside program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires Statewide
and State agency-specific strategic plans for diversity, equity, inclusion, and
accessibility in State government workforce.  Under the bill, the Commissioner
of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, in consultation with the State Treasurer,
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, and Chairperson and Chief
Executive Officer of the Civil Service Commission must establish a coordinated
Statewide initiative to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility
in the State government workforce.  Under the bill, the head of each State
agency must, no later than 45 days following the issuance of the Statewide
diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan, and annually
thereafter, develop and submit to Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion the diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the Commissioner
of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to issue guidance on and State agencies to
address:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) paid internships,
fellowships, and apprenticeships;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) strengthening partnerships
and recruitment with diverse communities and institutions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) data collection</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) ensuring accessibility for
State employees with disabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6) evaluating the existence
of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing State
employment opportunities; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) the availability and use
of diversity training programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
requirement, to be overseen and enforced by the new department, that any entity
which receives a development subsidy or financial assistance from the State
submit and implement a strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan to the
Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The plan is intended to assist
corporations and not-for-profit entities in better understanding the States
demographics, while affording minority-owned and women-owned businesses more
opportunities to participate in the procurement of goods and services to the
public and private sector.  The bill specifies what information an entity is
required to include in the strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan. 
Each recipient of a development subsidy or financial assistance is required,
for the duration of the subsidy or five years, whichever is longer, to submit
annual reports on the progress of the recipient towards achieving its
diversity, equity, and inclusion goals for the reporting period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also transfers the Division
on Civil Rights to the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The
division currently is in the Department of Law and Public Safety and is under
the direction of the Attorney General, in conjunction with a commission
consisting of seven public members appointed by the Governor.  Under the bill, the
commissioner of the department assumes the responsibilities of the Attorney
General.  The public member commission continues in its current capacity.</p>
