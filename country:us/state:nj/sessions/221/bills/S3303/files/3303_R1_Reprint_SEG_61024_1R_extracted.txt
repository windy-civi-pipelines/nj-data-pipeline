(8)   In determining whether a proposed capital investment will yield a net positive benefit, the authority shall not consider the transfer of an existing job from one location in the State to another location in the State as the creation of a new job, unless (a) the business proposes to transfer existing jobs to a municipality in the State as part of a consolidation of business operations from two or more other locations that are not in the same municipality whether in-State or out-of-State, or (b) the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, submits a certification to the authority indicating that the existing jobs are at risk of leaving the State and that the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, has reviewed the information submitted to the authority and that the representations contained therein are accurate, and the business intends to employ not fewer than 500 full-time employees in the qualified business facility. In the event that this certification by the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, is found to be willfully false, the authority may revoke any award of tax credits in their entirety, which revocation shall be in addition to any other criminal or civil penalties that the business and the officer may be subject to. When considering an application involving intra-State job transfers, the authority shall require the company to submit the following information as part of its application: a full economic analysis of all locations under consideration by the company; all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist. Based on this information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, before a business may be awarded any tax credits under this section. b.    (1)  If applications under this section have been received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), then, to the extent that there remains sufficient financial authorization for the award of a tax credit, the authority is authorized to consider those applications and to make awards of tax credits to eligible applicants, provided that the authority shall take final action on those applications no later than December 31, 2013. (2)   A business shall apply for the credit under this section prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), and shall submit its documentation for approval of its credit amount no later than December 31, 2023. (3)   If a business has submitted an application under this section and that application has not been approved for any reason, the lack of approval shall not serve to prejudice in any way the consideration of a new application as may be submitted for the qualified business facility for the provision of incentives offered pursuant to the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.). (4)   Tax credits awarded pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) for applications submitted to and approved by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), shall be administered by the authority in the manner established prior to that date. (5)   With respect to an application received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.) for a qualified business facility that is located on or adjacent to the campus of an acute care medical facility, (a) the minimum number of full-time employees required for eligibility under the program may be employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the facility, in the aggregate, and the initial satisfaction of the requirement following completion of the project shall be deemed to satisfy the employment requirements of the program in all respects, and (b) if the capital investment in the facility exceeds $100,000,000, the determination of the net positive benefit yield shall be based on the benefits generated during a period of up to 30 years following the completion of the project, as determined by the authority. c.     (1)  The amount of credit allowed shall, except as otherwise provided, be equal to the capital investment made by the business, or the capital investment represented by the business's leased area, or area owned by the business as a condominium, and shall be taken over a 10-year period, at the rate of one-tenth of the total amount of the business's credit for each tax accounting or privilege period of the business, beginning with the tax period in which the business is first certified by the authority as having met the investment capital and employment qualifications, subject to any reduction or disqualification as provided by subsection d. of this section as determined by annual review by the authority. In conducting its annual review, the authority may require a business to submit any information determined by the authority to be necessary and relevant to its review. The credit amount that may be taken for a tax period of the business that exceeds the final liabilities of the business for the tax period may be carried forward for use by the business in the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter, provided that the value of all credits approved by the authority against tax liabilities pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) in any fiscal year shall not exceed $260,000,000. The amount of credit allowed for a tax period to a business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility shall not exceed the business's total lease payments for occupancy of the qualified business facility for the tax period. A business may elect to suspend its obligations for the 2020, 2021, 2022, [or] 2023, or 2024 tax period, or any combination thereof, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the business shall make such election in writing to the authority before the issuance of the tax credit for the corresponding tax year and such suspension shall extend the term of the eligibility period by a corresponding amount of time. The authority shall modify the approval letter, and the business shall execute the modification within the time period provided by the authority. The modification shall provide that the failure to submit the annual report due to the suspension shall not be a forfeiture or an uncertified tax period. (2)   A business that is a partnership shall not be allowed a credit under this section directly, but the amount of credit of an owner of a business shall be determined by allocating to each owner of the partnership that proportion of the credit of the business that is equal to the owner of the partnership's share, whether or not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership for its tax period ending within or at the end of the owner's tax period, or that proportion that is allocated by an agreement, if any, among the owners of the partnership that has been provided to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury by the time and accompanied by the additional information as the director may require. (3)   The amount of credit allowed may be applied against the tax liability otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or pursuant to N.J.S.17B:23-5. d.    (1)  If, in any tax period, fewer than 200 full-time employees of the business at the qualified business facility are employed in new full-time positions, the amount of the credit otherwise determined pursuant to final calculation of the award of tax credits pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall be reduced by 20 percent for that tax period and each subsequent tax period until the first period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the 200 full-time employees employed in new full-time positions at the qualified business facility has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed; provided, however, that for businesses applying before January 1, 2010, there shall be no reduction if a business relocates to an urban transit hub from another location or other locations in the same municipality. For the purposes of this paragraph, a "new full-time position" means a position created by the business at the qualified business facility that did not previously exist in this State. (2)   If, in any tax period, the business reduces the total number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under subsection a. of this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the business's Statewide workforce to the threshold levels required by this paragraph has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (3)   If, in any tax period, (a) the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality drops below 250, or (b) the number of full-time employees, who are not the subject of intra-State job transfers, pursuant to paragraph (8) of subsection a. of this section, employed by the business at any other business facility in the State, whether or not located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality, drops by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility to 250 or an increase above the 20 percent reduction has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (4)   (i)  If the qualified business facility is sold in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new owner shall not acquire the capital investment of the seller and the seller shall forfeit all credits for the tax period in which the sale occurs and all subsequent tax periods; provided, however, that any credits of tenants shall remain unaffected. (ii)   If a tenant subleases its tenancy in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new tenant shall not acquire the credit of the sublessor, and the sublessor tenant shall forfeit all credits for the tax period of its sublease and all subsequent tax periods. (5)   Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before March 31, 2024, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i)    any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility for the 2023 tax period 1and, if elected by the business, the 2024 tax period1 through March 31, 2024; and (ii)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period through March 31, 2024, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  1Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed.1 (6)   1[For the period] Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-208) or any other law or regulation to the contrary,1 beginning on April 1, 2024, and for all subsequent tax periods, 1[the authority may authorize]1 a business 1located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 that has entered into an 1[amended]1 incentive agreement with the authority 1may elect1 to waive the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes this election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i)    1for a qualified business facility located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 40 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility during the tax period; 1[and]1 (ii)   1[following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the tax credit the business receives for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the municipal affordable housing trust fund in the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located] the business shall extend by two years the time it is required to maintain the project at a location in New Jersey beyond the time set forth in the incentive agreement; and (iii) at the time the business submits its tax credit certificate certification for the tax period, the business shall make a non-refundable payment of an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of the maximum annual tax credit that the business is eligible to receive for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within enhanced areas or government-restricted municipalities, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337), as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed1.

The sale or assignment of any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section shall not be exchanged for consideration received by the business of less than 75 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted. Any amount of a tax credit transfer certificate used by a purchaser or assignee against a tax liability shall be subject to the same privileges, limitations, and conditions that apply to the use of the credit by the business that originally applied for and was allowed the tax credit, including treating the amount of excess as an overpayment under subsection f. of this section. The tax credit transferee may not transfer its tax credit to any other party. h.    Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before March 31, 2024, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1) any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility for the 2023 tax period 1and, if elected by the business, the 2024 tax period1 through March 31, 2024; and (2) following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period through March 31, 2024, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  1Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed.1 i.     1[For the period] Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2 of P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-125) or any other law or regulation to the contrary,1 beginning on April 1, 2024, and for all subsequent tax periods, 1[the authority may authorize]1 a business 1located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 that has entered into an 1[amended]1 incentive agreement with the authority 1may elect1 to waive the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes this election shall satisfy the following criteria: (1)   1for a qualified business facility located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 40 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility during the tax period; 1[and]1 (2)   1[following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the tax credit the business receives for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the municipal affordable housing trust fund in the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located] the business shall extend by two years the time it is required to maintain the project at a location in New Jersey beyond the time set forth in the incentive agreement; and (3)   at the time the business submits its tax credit certificate certification for the tax period, the business shall make a non-refundable payment of an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of the maximum annual tax credit that the business is eligible to receive for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within enhanced areas or government-restricted municipalities, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337), as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed1. j.     1[The authority, in consultation with the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, may authorize a tax certificate holder to carry forward tax credits for an additional period specified by the authority, subject to the provisions of this section.  The] Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the1 credit amount may 1first1 be taken by the tax certificate holder for the tax period for which it was issued 1, for the tax period in which it was issued,1 or 1[may be carried forward for use by the tax certificate holder in any of the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter] in any tax period during the time the business is required to maintain the project at a location in New Jersey, as set forth in the incentive agreement1 . The tax certificate holder may transfer the tax credit amount on or after the date of issuance 1[or at any time after the date of issuance]1 for use by the transferee in the tax period for which it was issued 1, for the tax period in which it was issued,1 or 1[within a period to be determined by the authority, in consultation with the Division of Taxation, but not to exceed the 20 tax periods immediately succeeding the tax period for which it was issued.  In the case of a tax certificate received after the end of the tax period for which the tax certificate was issued, whether by transfer or original issuance, a tax certificate holder or transferee shall not be required to amend the tax return for the tax period for which the tax certificate was issued or any successive tax period to first apply the credit] in any of the next three successive tax periods1 . The tax certificate holder or transferee may first 1[claim] use1 the credit 1[in any tax period on or after the date of issuance] against tax liabilities in the tax period in which it was issued or in a succeeding tax period, as authorized in this subsection, without the need for amending the tax return for the tax period for which the credit was issued1 , subject to the 1[carry-forward provision in] provisions of1 this section.  1[Notwithstanding the foregoing, no more than the amount of tax credits equal to the total credit amount, divided by the number of years in which the credits may be claimed, not including carried-forward use, may be taken in any tax period.]1 (cf: P.L.2023, c.261, s.2) 3.    Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-209) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  (1)  A business, upon application to and approval from the authority, shall be allowed a credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility within an eligible municipality, pursuant to the restrictions and requirements of this section. To be eligible for any tax credits authorized under this section, a business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality. The value of all credits approved by the authority pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) shall not exceed $1,750,000,000, except as may be increased by the authority as set forth in paragraph (5) of subsection a. of section 35 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.34:1B-209.3) and section 6 of P.L.2010, c.57 (C.34:1B-209.4). (2)   A business, other than a tenant eligible pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection, shall make or acquire capital investments totaling not less than $50,000,000 in a qualified business facility, at which the business shall employ not fewer than 250 full-time employees to be eligible for a credit under this section. A business that acquires a qualified business facility shall also be deemed to have acquired the capital investment made or acquired by the seller. (3)   A business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility, the owner of which has made or acquired capital investments in the facility totaling not less than $50,000,000, shall occupy a leased area of the qualified business facility that represents at least $17,500,000 of the capital investment in the facility at which the tenant business and up to two other tenants in the qualified business facility shall employ not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the aggregate to be eligible for a credit under this section. The amount of capital investment in a facility that a leased area represents shall be equal to that percentage of the owner's total capital investment in the facility that the percentage of net leasable area leased by the tenant is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility. Capital investments made by a tenant shall be deemed to be included in the calculation of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner, but only to the extent necessary to meet the owner's minimum capital investment of $50,000,000. Capital investments made by a tenant and not allocated to meet the owner's minimum capital investment threshold of $50,000,000 shall be added to the amount of capital investment represented by the tenant's leased area in the qualified business facility. (4)   A business shall not be allowed tax credits under this section if the business participates in a business employment incentive agreement, pursuant to P.L.1996, c.26 (C.34:1B-124 et seq.), relating to the same capital and employees that qualify the business for this credit, or if the business receives assistance pursuant to P.L.1996, c.25 (C.34:1B-112 et seq.). A business that is allowed a tax credit under this section shall not be eligible for incentives authorized pursuant to P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.). A business shall not qualify for a tax credit under this section, based upon its capital investment and the employment of full-time employees, if that capital investment or employment was the basis for which a grant was provided to the business pursuant to the "InvestNJ Business Grant Program Act," P.L.2008, c.112 (C.34:1B-237 et seq.). (5)   Full-time employment for an accounting or a privilege period shall be determined as the average of the monthly full-time employment for the period. (6)   The capital investment of the owner of a qualified business facility is that percentage of the capital investment made or acquired by the owner of the building that the percentage of net leasable area of the qualified business facility not leased to tenants is of the total net leasable area of the qualified business facility. (7)   A business shall be allowed a tax credit of 100 percent of its capital investment, made after the effective date of P.L.2011, c.89 but prior to its submission of documentation pursuant to subsection c. of this section, in a qualified business facility that is part of a mixed use project, provided that (a) the qualified business facility represents at least $17,500,000 of the total capital investment in the mixed use project, (b) the business employs not fewer than 250 full-time employees in the qualified business facility, and (c) the total capital investment in the mixed use project of which the qualified business facility is a part is not less than $50,000,000. The allowance of credits under this paragraph shall be subject to the restrictions and requirements, to the extent that those are not inconsistent with the provisions of this paragraph, set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subsection, including, but not limited to, the requirement that the business shall demonstrate to the authority, at the time of application, that the State's financial support of the proposed capital investment in a qualified business facility will yield a net positive benefit to both the State and the eligible municipality. (8)   In determining whether a proposed capital investment will yield a net positive benefit, the authority shall not consider the transfer of an existing job from one location in the State to another location in the State as the creation of a new job, unless (a) the business proposes to transfer existing jobs to a municipality in the State as part of a consolidation of business operations from two or more other locations that are not in the same municipality whether in-State or out-of-State, or (b) the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, submits a certification to the authority indicating that the existing jobs are at risk of leaving the State and that the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, has reviewed the information submitted to the authority and that the representations contained therein are accurate, and the business intends to employ not fewer than 500 full-time employees in the qualified business facility. In the event that this certification by the business's chief executive officer, or equivalent officer, is found to be willfully false, the authority may revoke any award of tax credits in their entirety, which revocation shall be in addition to any other criminal or civil penalties that the business and the officer may be subject to. When considering an application involving intra-State job transfers, the authority shall require the company to submit the following information as part of its application: a full economic analysis of all locations under consideration by the company; all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist. Based on this information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, before a business may be awarded any tax credits under this section. b.    (1)  If applications under this section have been received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), then, to the extent that there remains sufficient financial authorization for the award of a tax credit, the authority is authorized to consider those applications and to make awards of tax credits to eligible applicants, provided that the authority shall take final action on those applications no later than December 31, 2013. (2)   A business shall apply for the credit under this section prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), and shall submit its documentation for approval of its credit amount no later than December 31, 2023. (3)   If a business has submitted an application under this section and that application has not been approved for any reason, the lack of approval shall not serve to prejudice in any way the consideration of a new application as may be submitted for the qualified business facility for the provision of incentives offered pursuant to the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.). (4)   Tax credits awarded pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) for applications submitted to and approved by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), shall be administered by the authority in the manner established prior to that date. (5)   With respect to an application received by the authority prior to the effective date of the "New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013," P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.) for a qualified business facility that is located on or adjacent to the campus of an acute care medical facility, (a) the minimum number of full-time employees required for eligibility under the program may be employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the facility, in the aggregate, and the initial satisfaction of the requirement following completion of the project shall be deemed to satisfy the employment requirements of the program in all respects, and (b) if the capital investment in the facility exceeds $100,000,000, the determination of the net positive benefit yield shall be based on the benefits generated during a period of up to 30 years following the completion of the project, as determined by the authority. c.     (1)  The amount of credit allowed shall, except as otherwise provided, be equal to the capital investment made by the business, or the capital investment represented by the business's leased area, or area owned by the business as a condominium, and shall be taken over a 10-year period, at the rate of one-tenth of the total amount of the business's credit for each tax accounting or privilege period of the business, beginning with the tax period in which the business is first certified by the authority as having met the investment capital and employment qualifications, subject to any reduction or disqualification as provided by subsection d. of this section as determined by annual review by the authority. In conducting its annual review, the authority may require a business to submit any information determined by the authority to be necessary and relevant to its review. The credit amount that may be taken for a tax period of the business that exceeds the final liabilities of the business for the tax period may be carried forward for use by the business in the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter, provided that the value of all credits approved by the authority against tax liabilities pursuant to P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-207 et seq.) in any fiscal year shall not exceed $260,000,000. The amount of credit allowed for a tax period to a business that is a tenant in a qualified business facility shall not exceed the business's total lease payments for occupancy of the qualified business facility for the tax period. A business may elect to suspend its obligations for the 2020, 2021, 2022, [or] 2023, or 2024 tax period, or any combination thereof, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, provided that the business shall make such election in writing to the authority before the issuance of the tax credit for the corresponding tax year and such suspension shall extend the term of the eligibility period by a corresponding amount of time. The authority shall modify the approval letter, and the business shall execute the modification within the time period provided by the authority. The modification shall provide that the failure to submit the annual report due to the suspension shall not be a forfeiture or an uncertified tax period. (2)   A business that is a partnership shall not be allowed a credit under this section directly, but the amount of credit of an owner of a business shall be determined by allocating to each owner of the partnership that proportion of the credit of the business that is equal to the owner of the partnership's share, whether or not distributed, of the total distributive income or gain of the partnership for its tax period ending within or at the end of the owner's tax period, or that proportion that is allocated by an agreement, if any, among the owners of the partnership that has been provided to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury by the time and accompanied by the additional information as the director may require. (3)   The amount of credit allowed may be applied against the tax liability otherwise due pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or pursuant to N.J.S.17B:23-5. d.    (1)  If, in any tax period, fewer than 200 full-time employees of the business at the qualified business facility are employed in new full-time positions, the amount of the credit otherwise determined pursuant to final calculation of the award of tax credits pursuant to subsection c. of this section shall be reduced by 20 percent for that tax period and each subsequent tax period until the first period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the 200 full-time employees employed in new full-time positions at the qualified business facility has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed; provided, however, that for businesses applying before January 1, 2010, there shall be no reduction if a business relocates to an urban transit hub from another location or other locations in the same municipality. For the purposes of this paragraph, a "new full-time position" means a position created by the business at the qualified business facility that did not previously exist in this State. (2)   If, in any tax period, the business reduces the total number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its Statewide workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under subsection a. of this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the business's Statewide workforce to the threshold levels required by this paragraph has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (3)   If, in any tax period, (a) the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality drops below 250, or (b) the number of full-time employees, who are not the subject of intra-State job transfers, pursuant to paragraph (8) of subsection a. of this section, employed by the business at any other business facility in the State, whether or not located in an urban transit hub within an eligible municipality, drops by more than 20 percent from the number of full-time employees in its workforce in the last tax accounting or privilege period prior to the credit amount approval under this section, then the business shall forfeit its credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the number of full-time employees employed by the business at the qualified business facility to 250 or an increase above the 20 percent reduction has been reviewed and approved by the authority, for which tax period and each subsequent tax period the full amount of the credit shall be allowed. (4)   (i)  If the qualified business facility is sold in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new owner shall not acquire the capital investment of the seller and the seller shall forfeit all credits for the tax period in which the sale occurs and all subsequent tax periods; provided, however, that any credits of tenants shall remain unaffected. (ii)   If a tenant subleases its tenancy in whole or in part during the 10-year eligibility period, the new tenant shall not acquire the credit of the sublessor, and the sublessor tenant shall forfeit all credits for the tax period of its sublease and all subsequent tax periods. (5)   Following the termination of the public health emergency declared by the Governor pursuant to Executive Order No. 103 of 2020, as extended, a business that has entered into an incentive agreement may elect, before March 31, 2024, to waive, for the period beginning on July 1, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2024, the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes such an election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i)    any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 10 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility for the 2023 tax period 1and, if elected by the business, the 2024 tax period1 through March 31, 2024; and (ii)   following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the 2022 tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to five percent of the amount of tax credit the business receives for the 2022 tax period through March 31, 2024, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located, as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  1Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed.1 (6)   1[For the period] Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2 of P.L.2007, c.346 (C.34:1B-208) or any other law or regulation to the contrary,1 beginning on April 1, 2024, and for all subsequent tax periods, 1[the authority may authorize]1 a business 1located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 that has entered into an 1[amended]1 incentive agreement with the authority 1may elect1 to waive the requirement that a full-time employee who is employed by the business shall spend at least 60 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility; provided, however, that a business that makes this election shall satisfy the following criteria: (i)    1for a qualified business facility located outside an enhanced area or government-restricted municipality, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337),1 any full-time employee employed by the business shall spend at least 40 percent of the employee's time at the qualified business facility during the tax period; 1[and]1 (ii)   1[following the receipt by the business of its tax credit certificate or tax credit transfer certificate for the tax period, the business shall make a payment of an amount equal to 20 percent of the amount of the tax credit the business receives for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the municipal affordable housing trust fund in the municipality in which the qualified business facility is located] the business shall extend by two years the time it is required to maintain the project at a location in New Jersey beyond the time set forth in the incentive agreement; and (iii) at the time the business submits its tax credit certificate certification for the tax period, the business shall make a non-refundable payment of an amount equal to 10 percent of the amount of the maximum annual tax credit that the business is eligible to receive for the tax period, which payment shall be made to the authority, and which payment the authority shall hold and make available for the provision of loans, guarantees, equity investments, and grants, or other forms of financing to support small business and downtown or commercial corridor activation activities within enhanced areas or government-restricted municipalities, as those terms are defined in section 69 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-337), as may be designated by the chief executive officer of the authority.  Such funds shall be deployed by the authority within 12 months of the authoritys receipt of the funds, and the authority shall issue a report each fiscal year to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), detailing how the funds were distributed1. (7)   1[The authority, in consultation with the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, may authorize a tax certificate holder to carry forward tax credits for an additional period specified by the authority, subject to the provisions of this section.  The] Notwithstanding the provisions of any law to the contrary, the1 credit amount may 1first1 be taken by the tax certificate holder for the tax period for which it was issued 1, for the tax period in which it was issued,1 or 1[may be carried forward for use by the tax certificate holder in any of the next 20 successive tax periods, and shall expire thereafter] in any tax period during the time the business is required to maintain the project at a location in New Jersey, as set forth in the incentive agreement1 .
