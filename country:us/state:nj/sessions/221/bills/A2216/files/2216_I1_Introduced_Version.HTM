envelopes containing the ballots that the board or the Superior Court has
rejected shall not be so opened, but shall be retained as provided for by this
act.  The board shall then proceed to canvass the votes cast on the mail-in

which the ballot was prepared shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed. 
Mail-in ballots deemed invalid because the ballots were received after 48 hours
after the closing of the polls shall be retained, including the outer and inner
envelopes, for a period of two years and shall be made available for inspection
by the voter.</u></p>
