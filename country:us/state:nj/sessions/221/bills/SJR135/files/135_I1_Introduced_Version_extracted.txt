Urinary tract infections are also becoming increasingly antibiotic resistant while proper diagnosis of a UTI, especially in the elderly population, remains difficult.  Diagnosis of UTIs among the elderly remains difficult due many factors, including a slower or suppressed immune system, increasing the likelihood of a missed or delayed diagnosis.  There also has not been much research focused on UTIs among the elderly; it was not until the 2000s that medical researchers focused their research specifically on UTI manifestation within the elderly population.  Finally, there is still unwarranted stigma associated with UTIs, with many seniors unwilling to openly discuss or seek medical care for UTIs. The establishment of October 24th of each year as National Senior UTI Awareness Day will help to bring awareness of and destigmatize conversations surrounding UTIs.
