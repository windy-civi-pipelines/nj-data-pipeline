Within five days of a change of address, a person whose name is included in the registry is required provide the AOC with the new address.

In addition, the provisions of the bill require a law enforcement officer to determine, upon an arrest, if there is a domestic violence restraining order entered against the person. This determination is to include a search of the central domestic violence registry maintained by the AOC established pursuant to N.J.S.A.2C:25-34, as well as the publicly-accessible central registry established under the bill. This bill, designated Stephanies Law, is named after a domestic violence victim, Stephanie Nicole Parze, who was murdered by her ex-boyfriend.  The Stephanie Nicole Parze Foundation was created in her memory to provide support to victims of domestic violence.  This bill, which is intended to provide additional protections for victims of domestic violence, is named in her honor.
