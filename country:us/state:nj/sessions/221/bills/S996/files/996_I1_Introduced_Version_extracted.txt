The super conciliator is required to complete the proceedings not later than 90 day after the super conciliator is selected.  If the actions taken by the super conciliator fail to resolve the dispute, the super conciliator is required to issue a final report not more than 30 days after the completion of the investigatory proceedings, to be provided to the parties promptly and made available to the public within 10 days after it issued.
