licenses; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill enters New Jersey
into the Counseling Compact.  The Counseling Compact (compact) is an interstate
compact, or a contract among states, allowing professional counselors licensed
and residing in a compact member state to practice in other compact member
states without need for multiple licenses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this compact is
to facilitate interstate practice of licensed professional counselors with the
goal of improving public access to professional counseling services.  The
practice of professional counseling occurs in the state where the client is
located at the time of the counseling services.  The compact preserves the
regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the
current system of state licensure.  In addition, the compact is designed to
achieve the following objectives:  1) increase public access to professional
counseling services by providing for the mutual recognition of other member
state licenses; 2) enhance the states ability to protect the publics health
and safety; 3) encourage the cooperation of member states in regulating
multistate practice for licensed professional counselors; 4) support spouses of
relocating active duty military personnel; 5) enhance the exchange of
licensure, investigative, and disciplinary information among member states; 6)
allow for the use of telehealth technology to facilitate increased access to
professional counseling services; 7) support the uniformity of professional
counseling licensure requirements throughout the states to promote public
safety and public health benefits; 8) invest all member states with the
authority to hold a licensed professional counselor accountable for meeting all
state practice laws in the state in which the client is located at the time care
is rendered through the mutual recognition of member state  licenses; 9)
eliminate the necessity for licenses in multiple states; and 10) provide
opportunities for interstate practice by licensed professional counselors who
meet uniform licensure requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact is administered by
a commission comprising representatives of each of the member states.  The
commission has certain powers to promulgate rules and bylaws, create a budget,
conduct investigations, assess member fees, and to generally enforce the
provisions of the compact.  The compact sets forth procedures for investigating
and disciplining professional counselors for misconduct, as well as for
communicating to member states information concerning a professional counselor
who is under investigation, has lost the right to practice under the compact,
or who has regained the right to practice under the compact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The compact provides that it
takes effect when it has been adopted in 10 states.  Currently, 16 states have
joined the compact:   Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio,
Tennessee, Utah, and West Virginia.</p>
