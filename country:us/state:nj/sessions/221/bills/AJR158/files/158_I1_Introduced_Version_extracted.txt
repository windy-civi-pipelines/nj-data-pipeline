STATEMENT This joint resolution establishes the New Jersey Diversity in Law Enforcement Task Force to study ways to increase diversity and community representation within law enforcement agencies throughout the State of New Jersey including State, local, and municipal police departments. Law enforcement officers serve a vital role in all communities throughout the State of New Jersey by enforcing the law, controlling crime, and maintaining public order and safety.  However, law enforcement officers are not always representative of the communities they serve.  In recognition of this, many law enforcement agencies have taken measures to increase the diversity of their officers, such as focusing recruitment efforts on underrepresented groups and providing mentoring to new recruits. Despite these efforts to increase diversity within law enforcement agencies, many still do not reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.  This lack of diversity and community representation within law enforcement agencies can make it increasingly difficult for law enforcement officers to build lasting community relationships.  For these reasons, it is important for law enforcement agencies to expand their efforts to diversify, so that law enforcement officers and the communities they serve can work together to keep all residents of the State of New Jersey safe. The task force shall consist of 13 members with representation from the Senate, the General Assembly, the Attorney General, the President of the New Jersey State Policemens Benevolent Association, the President of the New Jersey State Troopers Fraternal Association, the President of the New Jersey State Fraternal Order of Police, the National President of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the President of the New Jersey State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), two representatives of local police departments throughout the State, and two representatives of the public.  The task force shall examine current data, research, and policies related to diversity issues within law enforcement agencies and examine current diversity present within law enforcement agencies across the State including State, local, and municipal police departments.  In addition, the task force shall identify effective strategies to increase diversity and community representation within the States law enforcement agencies and develop recommendations to implement those strategies within law enforcement agencies. Within a year after the organization of the task force, the task force shall submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature of the task forces findings and recommendations.
