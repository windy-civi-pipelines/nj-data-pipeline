the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Health care is
inclusive of many specific disciplines working together to promote the
well-being of patients, including the oral health care provided by general and
specialized dentists;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Active, robust and fully
competitive markets for health care and dental services provide the best
opportunity for the residents of this State to receive high quality health care
and dental services at an appropriate cost;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>A substantial amount of health care and dental services in this State is
purchased for the benefit of patients by health and dental insurance carriers
engaged in the financing of health care and dental services or is otherwise
delivered subject to the terms of agreements between carriers and health care
providers;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Carriers are able to control the flow of patients to health care providers
through compelling financial incentives for patients in their health and dental
benefits plans to utilize only the services of health care providers with whom the
carriers have contracted;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Carriers also control the health care and dental services rendered to
patients through utilization management and other managed care tools and
associated coverage and payment policies;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Carriers are often able to virtually dictate the terms of the contracts
that they offer health care providers and commonly offer these contracts on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>The power of carriers to unilaterally impose provider contract terms
jeopardizes the ability of health care providers to deliver the superior
quality health care and dental services traditionally available in this State;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Health care providers do not have sufficient market power to reject </span>carriers
contract terms that impede their ability to deliver medically appropriate care
without undue delay or difficulties<span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     <span style='color:
black;letter-spacing:0pt'>Inadequate reimbursement and other unfair payment
terms that are advantageous to carriers adversely affect the quality of patient
care and access to care by reducing the resources that </span><span
style='letter-spacing:0pt'>health care providers<span style='color:black'> can
devote to patient care and decreasing the time that </span>health care
providers <span style='color:black'>are able to spend with their patients;</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Inequitable reimbursement and other unfair payment terms also endanger the
health care infrastructure and progress by diverting capital needed for
reinvestment in the health care delivery system, curtailing the purchase of
state-of-the-art technology, the pursuit of medical research, and expansion of health
care services, all to the detriment of the residents of this State;</span></p>

<p style='line-height:150%'>     k.    <span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>The
inevitable collateral reduction and migration of the health care work force
will also have negative consequences for the economy of this State;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>Empowering independent health care providers to jointly negotiate with
carriers as provided in this act will help restore the competitive balance and
improve competition in the markets for health care and dental services in this

negotiation.  The negotiations would be carried out through a joint negotiation
representative selected by a health care provider to act on their behalf.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the bill, two or more
health care providers practicing in a service area of a carrier can jointly
negotiate, and engage in related joint activity, regarding non-fee-related
matters which may affect patient care, including (1) the definition of medical
necessity and other conditions of coverage; (2) clinical practice guidelines;
and (3) any provider rating program and the ability to appeal a carriers
rating of a provider. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the bill
establishes that if the Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner
of Banking and Insurance, finds that a carrier has substantial market power in
its service area and that any of the terms or conditions of the contract with
the carrier pose an actual or potential threat to the quality and availability
of patient care among covered persons, two or more independent health care
providers may jointly negotiate with the carrier, and engage in related joint
activity, on fees and fee-related matters.  This includes such items as (1) the
amount of payment or the methodology for determining the payment for a health
care or dental service, including, but not limited to, cost of living
increases; (2) the amount of any discount on the price of a health care or
dental service; and (3) the procedure code or other description of a health
care or dental service covered by a payment and the appropriate grouping of the
procedure codes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes
that, before entering into negotiations, a person or entity which proposes to
act as a joint negotiation representative is to submit a petition to enter into
negotiations to the Attorney General for approval.  The petition is to
identify, among other items, the representative, the health care providers who
the representative will represent, and the intended subject matter of the
proposed negotiations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a process is
established regarding the steps necessary for when the joint negotiation
representative and the carrier have reached an agreement on the contractual
terms or conditions that were the subject matter of negotiations.  The bill
also stipulates that if a party to the negotiations decides to decline or
terminate negotiations, within 14 days of this decision, the joint negotiation
representative is to report to the Attorney General that negotiations have
ended.  The Attorney General may, within 30 days <span style='letter-spacing:
0pt'>of a termination, make a binding determination as to the merits of the
joint negotiation request</span><span style='color:black'>.</span>  The bill
also establishes the process by which the Attorney General is to provide
written approval or disapproval of a petition or proposed contract furnished by
a joint negotiation representative.  A decision by the Attorney General to
approve or disapprove is to be rendered within 30 days after receipt of the
petition or proposed contract.  If that timeline passes with no decision
rendered, the joint negotiation representative may petition a court for an
order to require a decision from the Attorney General.  The petition or
proposed contract is to be approved by the Attorney General shall approve a petition
or a proposed contract if a determination is made that the petition or proposed
contract demonstrates that the benefits which are likely to result from the
proposed joint negotiations or contract outweigh the disadvantages attributable
to a reduction in competition that may result from the proposed joint
negotiations.  If a decision is made to disapprove of a petition or proposed
contract, a petitioner has 45 days to submit a written request to the Attorney
General for a hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill requires the
Attorney General, in consultation with the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance, to report annually to the Governor and the Legislature on the
implementation of the bill. The report is to include, among other items, an
assessment of the impact that the bill has had on health insurance premiums in
the State.  The report is to also include the recommendations of the Attorney
General as to whether the provisions of the substitute should be expanded to
include other types of health care facilities.</p>
