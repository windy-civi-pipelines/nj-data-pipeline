The superintendent may change the rank and grade of any trooper, detective, first line supervisor, mid-level manager, or executive-level personnel of the division for the efficient operation of the division. c.

Further, the bill provides that the superintendent may only make changes to command staff positions holding the rank of major and lieutenant colonel upon the approval of the Attorney General. The bill requires that any personnel changes should be achieved within the limitations of the divisions appropriations, consistent with current law.
