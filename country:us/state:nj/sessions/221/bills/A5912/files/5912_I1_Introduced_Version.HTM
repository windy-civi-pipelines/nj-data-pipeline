<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>establishing a State health insurance public
option and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    <span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>This act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;New
Jersey Public Option Health Care Act.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     2.    The Legislature finds and declares that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     a.     All residents of the State have the right to
health care.  While the federal Affordable Care Act brought many improvements
in health care and health coverage, it still leaves many New Jerseyans without
coverage or with inadequate coverage.  New Jerseyans, as individuals,
employers, and taxpayers have experienced a rise in the cost of health care and
coverage in recent years, including rising premiums, deductibles and co-pays,
restricted provider networks and high out-of-network charges.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     b.    Businesses have also experienced increases in
the costs of health care benefits for their employees, and many employers are
shifting a larger share of the cost of coverage to their employees or dropping
coverage entirely.  Health care providers are also affected by inadequate
health coverage in the State of New Jersey.  A large portion of voluntary and
public hospitals, health centers and other providers now experience substantial
losses due to the provision of care that is uncompensated.  Individuals often
find that they are deprived of affordable care and choice because of decisions
by health plans guided by the plan's economic needs rather than their health
care needs.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     c.     Affordable and comprehensive health coverage
must be provided to address the fiscal crisis facing the health care system and
the State and to ensure that New Jerseyans can exercise their right to health
care.  It is the intent of the Legislature to create the New Jersey Public
Option Health Care Program to provide a universal health plan option available
to every New Jerseyan. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='color:black;
letter-spacing:0pt'>     d.    The State shall obtain waivers and other
approvals relating to Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, Medicare, the Affordable Care
Act, and any other appropriate federal programs, under which federal funds and
other subsidies that are paid to the State of New Jersey are used, as
appropriate, to create a public option for New Jerseyans to purchase health
insurance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='color:black;letter-spacing:0pt'>     e.     If any necessary waiver or
approval is not obtained, the State shall use State plan amendments and seek
waivers and approvals to maximize, and make as seamless as possible, the use of
federal funds to facilitate the New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='color:black;letter-spacing:0pt'>     f.     In order to promote improved
quality of, and access to, health care services and promote improved clinical
outcomes, it is the policy of the State to encourage cooperative, collaborative
and integrative arrangements among health care providers who will participate
in the New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program, under the active
supervision of the Commissioner of Health.  It is the intent of the State to
supplant competition with such arrangements and regulation only to the extent
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%;background:white'><span
style='color:black;letter-spacing:0pt'>     g.    The Department of Health
shall create a New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program that includes as
many providers as possible and comes at the lowest possible cost for New
Jerseyans shopping for health insurance and that provides an efficient,
competitive publicly-run alternative to the private insurance market.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, the &quot;New
Jersey Public Option Health Care Act,&quot; creates the New Jersey Public
Option Health Care Program in the Department of Health.  The bill requires the
Commissioner of Health, in consultation with the Commissioner of Banking and
Insurance, to establish and implement the program, which will provide a
comprehensive health insurance coverage option to every State resident who
enrolls in the program.  The health insurance coverage offered by the program
shall compete in the market with insurance offered by private health insurers. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner will
determine when individuals may begin enrolling in the program.  There shall be
an implementation period, which shall begin on the date that individuals may
begin enrolling in the program and shall end as determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill creates the New
Jersey Public Option Health Care Board to consider any matter to effectuate the
provisions and purposes of the bill, and to advise the commissioner in that
regard.  The board shall be composed of the Commissioner of Health, the
Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, and the Treasurer, or their designees,
as ex officio members.  In addition, the board will have 11 members to be
appointed by the Governor:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   three of whom shall be
representatives of health care consumer advocacy organizations which have a
Statewide or regional constituency, who have been involved in activities
related to health care consumer advocacy, including issues of interest to low-
and moderate-income individuals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   one of whom shall be a
representative of professional organizations representing physicians;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   one of whom shall be a
representative of professional organizations representing licensed or
registered health care professionals other than physicians;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   two of whom shall be
representatives of hospitals, and of those two, one of whom shall be a
representative of public hospitals;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   one of whom shall be a representative
of community health centers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   one of whom shall be a
representative of health care organizations; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   one of whom shall be a representative
of organized labor; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   one of whom shall have
demonstrated expertise in health care finance; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board will also include
six members appointed by the Governor; two of whom to be appointed on the
recommendation of the Speaker of the General Assembly; two of whom to be
appointed on the recommendation of the President of the Senate; one of whom to
be appointed on the recommendation of the Minority Leader of the General Assembly;
and one of whom to be appointed on the recommendation of the Minority Leader of
the Senate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Members will serve without
compensation but will be reimbursed for their necessary and actual expenses
incurred while engaged in the business of the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, every resident
of the State will be eligible and entitled to enroll as a member under the
program.  The Commissioner of Health is to establish premiums for which members
are responsible and other charges for enrolling in or being a member under the
program.  The premium shall be determined in a manner to make the program
viable, but at the lowest possible cost to members. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
program will provide comprehensive health coverage to every member.  The
commissioner will also determine premiums, deductibles, co-payments or
co-insurance under the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner is also
required to establish and maintain procedures and standards for health care
providers to be qualified to participate in the program, including but not
limited to procedures and standards relating to the revocation, suspension,
limitation, or annulment of qualification to participate on a determination
that the health care provider is an incompetent provider of specific health
care services or has exhibited a course of conduct which is either inconsistent
with program standards and regulations or which exhibits an  unwillingness to
meet such standards and regulations, or is a potential threat to the public
health or safety.  Such procedures and standards shall not limit health care
provider participation in the program for economic purposes and shall be
consistent with good professional practice.  Any health care provider who is
qualified to participate under Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare or Medicare shall be
deemed to be qualified to participate in the program, and any health care
provider's revocation, suspension, limitation, or annulment of qualification to
participate in any of those programs shall apply to the health care provider's
qualification to participate in the program; provided that a health care
provider qualified in this manner shall follow the procedures to become qualified
under the program by the end of the implementation period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The program will engage in
good faith negotiations with health care providers' representatives including,
but not limited to, in relation to rates of payment and payment methodologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every participating provider
is required to furnish to the program such information to, and permit
examination of its records by, the program, as may be reasonably required for
purposes of reviewing accessibility and utilization of health care services,
quality assurance, and cost containment, the making of payments, and
statistical or other studies of the operation of the program or for protection
and promotion of public, environmental and occupational health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifies that the program
will maintain the confidentiality of all data and other information collected
under the program when such data would be normally considered confidential data
between a patient and health care provider.  Aggregate data of the program
which is derived from confidential data but does not violate patient
confidentiality will be public information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
commissioner shall seek all federal waivers and other federal approvals and arrangements
and submit State plan amendments necessary to operate the program consistent
with the bill and to maximize access to health care for residents of the State. 
The  commissioner shall apply to the Secretary of Health and Human Services or
other appropriate federal official for all waivers of requirements, and make
other arrangements, under Medicare, any federally-matched public health
program, the Affordable Care Act, and any other federal programs that provide
federal funds for payment for health care services, that are necessary to
enable all New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program members to receive all
benefits under the program through the program and to enable the State to
implement the provisions of the bill and to receive and deposit all federal
payments under those programs, where appropriate, including funds that may be
provided in lieu of premium tax credits, cost-sharing subsidies, and small
business tax credits, in the State treasury to the credit of the New Jersey
Public Option Health Care Trust Fund and to use those funds for the New Jersey
Public Option Health Care Program and other provisions under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner will also
directly, and through contracts with not-for-profit organizations, provide:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   consumer assistance to
individuals with respect to enrolling, obtaining health care services,
disenrolling, and other matters relating to the program; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   health care provider
assistance to health care providers providing and seeking or considering
whether to provide, health care services under the program, with respect to
participating in a health care organization and dealing with a health care
organization.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes in the
Department of the Treasury a nonlapsing revolving fund to be known as the New
Jersey Public Option Health Care Trust Fund.  This fund shall be the
repository for monies collected under the bill and other monies received as
grants or otherwise appropriated for the purposes of the program.  The monies
in the fund shall be used only for the purpose of supporting the activities of
the program and as otherwise provided for in the bill.  </p>
