An Act establishing a State health insurance public option and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the "New Jersey Public Option Health Care Act." 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     All residents of the State have the right to health care.  While the federal Affordable Care Act brought many improvements in health care and health coverage, it still leaves many New Jerseyans without coverage or with inadequate coverage.  New Jerseyans, as individuals, employers, and taxpayers have experienced a rise in the cost of health care and coverage in recent years, including rising premiums, deductibles and co-pays, restricted provider networks and high out-of-network charges. b.    Businesses have also experienced increases in the costs of health care benefits for their employees, and many employers are shifting a larger share of the cost of coverage to their employees or dropping coverage entirely.  Health care providers are also affected by inadequate health coverage in the State of New Jersey.  A large portion of voluntary and public hospitals, health centers and other providers now experience substantial losses due to the provision of care that is uncompensated.  Individuals often find that they are deprived of affordable care and choice because of decisions by health plans guided by the plan's economic needs rather than their health care needs. c.     Affordable and comprehensive health coverage must be provided to address the fiscal crisis facing the health care system and the State and to ensure that New Jerseyans can exercise their right to health care.  It is the intent of the Legislature to create the New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program to provide a universal health plan option available to every New Jerseyan. d.    The State shall obtain waivers and other approvals relating to Medicaid, NJ FamilyCare, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and any other appropriate federal programs, under which federal funds and other subsidies that are paid to the State of New Jersey are used, as appropriate, to create a public option for New Jerseyans to purchase health insurance. e.     If any necessary waiver or approval is not obtained, the State shall use State plan amendments and seek waivers and approvals to maximize, and make as seamless as possible, the use of federal funds to facilitate the New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program. f.     In order to promote improved quality of, and access to, health care services and promote improved clinical outcomes, it is the policy of the State to encourage cooperative, collaborative and integrative arrangements among health care providers who will participate in the New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program, under the active supervision of the Commissioner of Health.  It is the intent of the State to supplant competition with such arrangements and regulation only to the extent necessary to accomplish the purposes of this act. g.    The Department of Health shall create a New Jersey Public Option Health Care Program that includes as many providers as possible and comes at the lowest possible cost for New Jerseyans shopping for health insurance and that provides an efficient, competitive publicly-run alternative to the private insurance market. 3.    As used in this act: "Affordable Care Act" means the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub.L.111-148, as amended by the federal Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, Pub.L.111-152, and any federal rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto.
