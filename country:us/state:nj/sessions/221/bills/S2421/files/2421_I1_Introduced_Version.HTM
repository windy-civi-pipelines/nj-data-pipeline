<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 12 of P.L.            , c.               (C.              ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the
&quot;Freedom to Read Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The freedom to read is
a human right, constitutionally protected by the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution, and individuals have the right to free inquiry and the
right to form their own opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The freedom to read does
not require a person to agree with topics or themes within a material, but
instead allows a reader to explore and engage with differing perspectives to
form and inform their own views.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Since <u><span
style='color:black;border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in;background:white'>Tinker
v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist.</span></u><span style='color:black;
border:none windowtext 1.0pt;padding:0in;background:white'>, 393 U.S. 503
(1969), it has been well established</span> that students do not shed their
constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse
gate[,] and, as such, students have a right to access a diverse range of
age-relevant information, stories, perspectives, and ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In <u>Bd. of Ed.  v.
Pico</u>, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), the United States Supreme Court recognized that
school libraries are completely voluntary on the part of students[,] a
students selection of books from a school library is entirely a matter of
free choice[,] and the school library affords a student an opportunity at
self-education and individual enrichment that is wholly optional. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     School libraries and
public libraries, as centers for voluntary inquiry, play a unique role in
promoting intellectual freedom, providing equitable access to learning resources,
and promoting democracy by providing service to all regardless of race,
ethnicity, creed, age, ability, gender, or socio-economic status. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     School library media
specialists and librarians are essential members of the community; as trained
professionals, they help young people of all backgrounds find and interpret the
information they need to succeed in school and prepare for college, careers,
and life. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    School library media
specialists and librarians receive extensive professional training that
prepares them to develop and curate collections designed to meet the broad and
varied interests and needs of their communities and students, which is based on
a variety of factors, including pedagogical value, student interest, and the
age-appropriateness of the material. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Despite this, school
library media specialists and librarians have been targeted, harassed, and
defamed for providing young people access to library material.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>     </span>i.     Therefore,
it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to protect the freedom of New
Jerseys residents to read, for school libraries and public libraries to
acquire and maintain materials without external limitations, to recognize that
school library media specialists and librarians are trained to curate and
develop collections, and to protect school library media specialists and
librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted harassment and defamation for
performance of their duties. </p>

before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

points of view concerning contemporary problems and issues, whether
international, national, or local; but excludes content that is inappropriate
for grades and age groups served by the school library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Emotional distress means
significant mental suffering or distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Library material means any

subsections l. and m. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or to
attempt, or to conspire to do so. Such prohibited conduct shall include, but
not be limited to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Buying from, selling to,
leasing from or to, licensing, contracting with, trading with, providing goods,
services, or information to, or otherwise doing business with any person
because that person does, or agrees or attempts to do, any such act or any act
prohibited by this subsection; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Boycotting, commercially
blacklisting or refusing to buy from, sell to, lease from or to, license,
contract with, provide goods, services or information to, or otherwise do
business with any person because that person has not done or refuses to do any
such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; provided that this
subsection shall not prohibit refusals or other actions either pertaining to
employee-employer collective bargaining, labor disputes, or unfair labor
practices, or made or taken in connection with a protest of unlawful
discrimination or unlawful employment practices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    For any multiple listing
service, real estate brokers' organization or other service, organization or
facility related to the business of selling or renting dwellings to deny any
person access to or membership or participation in such organization, or to
discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access,

origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership
status, familial status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender identity or
expression, affectional or sexual orientation, disability, liability for
service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.    Nothing in the
provisions of this section shall affect the ability of an employer to require
employees to adhere to reasonable workplace appearance, grooming and dress
standards not precluded by other provisions of State or federal law, except
that an employer shall allow an employee to appear, groom and dress consistent
with the employee's gender identity or expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q. (1) For any employer to
impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment,
including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or
conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held
religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the
observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or
other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious
belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates
that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance
or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall
not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during
hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be
applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an
accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q.
shall be construed as reducing:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The number of the hours
worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority,
pension or other benefits; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Any premium wages or
benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For an employer to
refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this
subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely
held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer
to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place
of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement
of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a
reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of
employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall,
wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by
an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time,
or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than
sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by
the employer of that person as leave taken without pay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) (a) For purposes of this
subsection q., &quot;undue hardship&quot; means an accommodation requiring
unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or
efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority
system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   In determining whether
the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall
include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    The identifiable cost
of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of
retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to
another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   The number of
individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held
religious observance or practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (iii)   For an employer with
multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or
administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the
accommodation more difficult or expensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   An accommodation shall
be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the
inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in
which he or she is employed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   (i) The provisions of
this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of
religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship
or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   This subsection q.
shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of
attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the
employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph
(d) shall be upon the employer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     r.     For any employer to
take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or
disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer
from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information
regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation,
including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of
the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national
origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the
employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as
a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a
waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree,
not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the
employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to
any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     s.     For an employer to
treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer
knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner
less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or
breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition,
an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make
available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as
bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance
with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary
transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the
pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the
accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child,
the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee
and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall,
in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for
the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation
would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The
employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or
privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace
accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave
provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be
provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to
other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their
ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as
otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or
unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section &quot;pregnancy or breastfeeding&quot; means pregnancy, childbirth, and
breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions
related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from
childbirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship
on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered
include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number
of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of
the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the
employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking
into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside
funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an
essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business
necessity requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     t.     For an employer to pay
any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of
compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the
employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for
substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and
responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation
of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in
order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of
compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made
pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   That the differential is
based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the
characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education
or experience, or the quantity or quality of production;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   That the factor or
factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation
based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   That each of the factors
is applied reasonably;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   That one or more of the
factors account for the entire wage differential; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   That the factors are
job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate
business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it
is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve
the same business purpose without producing the wage differential.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Comparisons of wage rates
shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. 
For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;member of a protected class&quot;
means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed,
color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union
status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic
information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or
atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, <b><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     15.  This act shall take

Education and State Librarian may take such anticipatory action as may be
necessary for the implementation of the act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the &quot;Freedom
to Read Act,&quot; establishes requirements for library material in public
school libraries and public libraries and establishes protections for school
library media specialists and librarians against harassment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, boards of
education and governing boards of public libraries are required to adopt
policies on the curation of library material within school libraries and public
libraries.  Library material is defined under the bill to mean any material
including, but not limited to, nonfiction and fiction books; magazines;
reference books; supplementary titles; multimedia and digital material;
software and instructional material and other material not required as part of
classroom instruction, belonging to, on loan to, or otherwise in the custody of
a school library or public library.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To assist boards of education
in establishing a policy on the library material within school libraries, the
Commissioner of Education is to create a model policy in consultation with the
State Librarian and the New Jersey Association of School Librarians.  The bill
also requires the State Librarian to establish a model policy, in consultation
with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public
libraries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further requires boards
of education and governing boards of public libraries to adopt policies
creating a procedure regarding requests for removal of library material from a
school library or public library.  These policies are to establish a mechanism
to challenge a library material, create a review committee, and require a
written statement of reasons on the final determination of the library
material.  The State Librarian is to establish a model policy, in consultation
with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public
libraries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires boards
of education and governing boards of public libraries to include diverse and
inclusive material within their respective libraries.  Students are to be able
to reserve, check out, or access any age- and grade-appropriate library
material, including diverse and inclusive materials.  Similarly, residents are
to be able to reserve, check out, or access any library material, including
diverse and inclusive materials. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill defines diverse and
inclusive material to mean any material that reflects any protected class as
enumerated in the &quot;Law Against Discrimination,&quot; (LAD); material
produced by an author notwithstanding the authors membership in a protected class
as enumerated in the LAD; and material that contains the author's points of
view concerning contemporary problems and issues, whether international,
national or local; but excludes content that is inappropriate for grades and
age groups served by the school library.  The LAD bars discrimination on the
basis of a persons race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex,
gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital
status, liability for service in the Armed Forces, disability, or nationality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Further, this bill provides
that a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or
any other staff member of a public library that engages in activities required
under the bill is to be immune from criminal and civil liability.  These
individuals are also to have a civil cause of action for any relevant tort
against any person who harasses the school library media specialist, teaching
staff member, librarian, or any other staff member of a public library for
complying with the provisions of the bill.  Harassment or harasses is
defined in the bill as a singular act that is severe or pervasive, or a series
of acts over any period of time directed at a specific person that serves no
legitimate purpose and would cause, or has caused, a reasonable person to
suffer emotional distress.  Emotional distress is defined as significant
mental suffering or distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill creates
an affirmative defense for a prosecution for obscenity for school library media
specialists, teaching staff members, librarians, or any staff member of a
public library that are complying with the provisions of this bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill expands the
scope of the LAD, to incorporate protection against discriminatory acts against
a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any
staff member of a public library based upon their refusal to remove library
material except as permitted under the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent that
the Legislature protect the freedom of New Jerseys residents to read, for
school libraries and public libraries to acquire and maintain materials without
external limitations, to recognize that school library media specialists and
librarians are trained to curate and develop collections, and to protect school
library media specialists and librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted
harassment and defamation for performance of their duties. </p>
