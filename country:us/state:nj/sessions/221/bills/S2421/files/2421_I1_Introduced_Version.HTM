TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senators McKnight, McKeon, B.Smith, Mukherji, Stack and Burgess SYNOPSIS "Freedom to Read Act"; establishes requirements for library material in public school libraries and public libraries; protects school library media specialists and librarians from harassment. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning public school libraries and public libraries, supplementing Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, and amending N.J.S.2C:34-3 and P.L.1945, c.169. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 12 of P.L.            , c.               (C.              ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Freedom to Read Act." 2.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The freedom to read is a human right, constitutionally protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and individuals have the right to free inquiry and the right to form their own opinions. b.    The freedom to read does not require a person to agree with topics or themes within a material, but instead allows a reader to explore and engage with differing perspectives to form and inform their own views. c.     Since Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969), it has been well established that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate[,] and, as such, students have a right to access a diverse range of age-relevant information, stories, perspectives, and ideas. d.    In Bd. of Ed.  v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), the United States Supreme Court recognized that school libraries are completely voluntary on the part of students[,] a students selection of books from a school library is entirely a matter of free choice[,] and the school library affords a student an opportunity at self-education and individual enrichment that is wholly optional. e.     School libraries and public libraries, as centers for voluntary inquiry, play a unique role in promoting intellectual freedom, providing equitable access to learning resources, and promoting democracy by providing service to all regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, age, ability, gender, or socio-economic status. f.     School library media specialists and librarians are essential members of the community; as trained professionals, they help young people of all backgrounds find and interpret the information they need to succeed in school and prepare for college, careers, and life. g.    School library media specialists and librarians receive extensive professional training that prepares them to develop and curate collections designed to meet the broad and varied interests and needs of their communities and students, which is based on a variety of factors, including pedagogical value, student interest, and the age-appropriateness of the material. h.    Despite this, school library media specialists and librarians have been targeted, harassed, and defamed for providing young people access to library material. i.     Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to protect the freedom of New Jerseys residents to read, for school libraries and public libraries to acquire and maintain materials without external limitations, to recognize that school library media specialists and librarians are trained to curate and develop collections, and to protect school library media specialists and librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted harassment and defamation for performance of their duties. 3.    (New section) As used in sections 4 through 7 of P.L.            , c.               (C.              ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Diverse and inclusive material means any material that reflects any protected class as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); material produced by an author notwithstanding the authors membership in a protected class as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); and material that contains the author's points of view concerning contemporary problems and issues, whether international, national, or local; but excludes content that is inappropriate for grades and age groups served by the school library. Emotional distress means significant mental suffering or distress. Harassment or harasses means a singular act that is severe or pervasive, or a series of acts over any period of time directed at a specific person that serves no legitimate purpose and would cause, or has caused, a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress. Library material means any material including, but not limited to, nonfiction and fiction books; magazines; reference books; supplementary titles; multimedia and digital material; software and instructional material and other material not required as part of classroom instruction, belonging to, on loan to, or otherwise in the custody of a school library. 4.    (New section) a.  A board of education shall adopt a policy on the curation of library material within a school library.  When developing the policy, the board shall review the model policy established by the Commissioner of Education pursuant to subsection b. of this section.  The board shall have control over the content of the policy, except that the policy shall, at a minimum: (1)   recognize that library material should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all students and should present diverse points of view in the collection as a whole;

(2)   Refuse to grant or accept any letter of credit or other document which evidences the transfer of funds or credit, or refuse to enter into any contract for the exchange of goods or services, on the ground that it does not contain such a discriminatory provision or certification. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any letter of credit, contract, or other document which contains any provision pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, a labor dispute or an unfair labor practice, or made in connection with the protest of unlawful discrimination or an unlawful employment practice, if the other provisions of such letter of credit, contract, or other document do not otherwise violate the provisions of this subsection. n.    For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, coerce, or induce the doing of any act forbidden by subsections l. and m. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or to attempt, or to conspire to do so. Such prohibited conduct shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   Buying from, selling to, leasing from or to, licensing, contracting with, trading with, providing goods, services, or information to, or otherwise doing business with any person because that person does, or agrees or attempts to do, any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; or (2)   Boycotting, commercially blacklisting or refusing to buy from, sell to, lease from or to, license, contract with, provide goods, services or information to, or otherwise do business with any person because that person has not done or refuses to do any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; provided that this subsection shall not prohibit refusals or other actions either pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, labor disputes, or unfair labor practices, or made or taken in connection with a protest of unlawful discrimination or unlawful employment practices. o.    For any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization or other service, organization or facility related to the business of selling or renting dwellings to deny any person access to or membership or participation in such organization, or to discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or participation, on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, familial status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, disability, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality. p.    Nothing in the provisions of this section shall affect the ability of an employer to require employees to adhere to reasonable workplace appearance, grooming and dress standards not precluded by other provisions of State or federal law, except that an employer shall allow an employee to appear, groom and dress consistent with the employee's gender identity or expression. q. (1) For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3) (a) For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i) The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, [or] liability for service in the armed forces, or the refusal of a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any staff member of a public library to remove library material from a school library or a public library, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 15.  This act shall take effect one year following the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Education and State Librarian may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary for the implementation of the act. STATEMENT This bill, entitled the "Freedom to Read Act," establishes requirements for library material in public school libraries and public libraries and establishes protections for school library media specialists and librarians against harassment. Under the bill, boards of education and governing boards of public libraries are required to adopt policies on the curation of library material within school libraries and public libraries.  Library material is defined under the bill to mean any material including, but not limited to, nonfiction and fiction books; magazines; reference books; supplementary titles; multimedia and digital material; software and instructional material and other material not required as part of classroom instruction, belonging to, on loan to, or otherwise in the custody of a school library or public library. To assist boards of education in establishing a policy on the library material within school libraries, the Commissioner of Education is to create a model policy in consultation with the State Librarian and the New Jersey Association of School Librarians.  The bill also requires the State Librarian to establish a model policy, in consultation with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public libraries. The bill further requires boards of education and governing boards of public libraries to adopt policies creating a procedure regarding requests for removal of library material from a school library or public library.  These policies are to establish a mechanism to challenge a library material, create a review committee, and require a written statement of reasons on the final determination of the library material.  The State Librarian is to establish a model policy, in consultation with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public libraries. The bill also requires boards of education and governing boards of public libraries to include diverse and inclusive material within their respective libraries.  Students are to be able to reserve, check out, or access any age- and grade-appropriate library material, including diverse and inclusive materials.  Similarly, residents are to be able to reserve, check out, or access any library material, including diverse and inclusive materials. The bill defines diverse and inclusive material to mean any material that reflects any protected class as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," (LAD); material produced by an author notwithstanding the authors membership in a protected class as enumerated in the LAD; and material that contains the author's points of view concerning contemporary problems and issues, whether international, national or local; but excludes content that is inappropriate for grades and age groups served by the school library.  The LAD bars discrimination on the basis of a persons race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces, disability, or nationality. Further, this bill provides that a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any other staff member of a public library that engages in activities required under the bill is to be immune from criminal and civil liability.  These individuals are also to have a civil cause of action for any relevant tort against any person who harasses the school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any other staff member of a public library for complying with the provisions of the bill.  Harassment or harasses is defined in the bill as a singular act that is severe or pervasive, or a series of acts over any period of time directed at a specific person that serves no legitimate purpose and would cause, or has caused, a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress.  Emotional distress is defined as significant mental suffering or distress. Additionally, the bill creates an affirmative defense for a prosecution for obscenity for school library media specialists, teaching staff members, librarians, or any staff member of a public library that are complying with the provisions of this bill. Finally, this bill expands the scope of the LAD, to incorporate protection against discriminatory acts against a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any staff member of a public library based upon their refusal to remove library material except as permitted under the bill. It is the sponsors intent that the Legislature protect the freedom of New Jerseys residents to read, for school libraries and public libraries to acquire and maintain materials without external limitations, to recognize that school library media specialists and librarians are trained to curate and develop collections, and to protect school library media specialists and librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted harassment and defamation for performance of their duties.

S2421 SENATE, No. 2421 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JANUARY 29, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Senator  M. TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senators McKnight, McKeon, B.Smith, Mukherji, Stack and Burgess SYNOPSIS "Freedom to Read Act"; establishes requirements for library material in public school libraries and public libraries; protects school library media specialists and librarians from harassment. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning public school libraries and public libraries, supplementing Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes, and amending N.J.S.2C:34-3 and P.L.1945, c.169. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 12 of P.L.            , c.               (C.              ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the "Freedom to Read Act." 2.    (New section) The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The freedom to read is a human right, constitutionally protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, and individuals have the right to free inquiry and the right to form their own opinions. b.    The freedom to read does not require a person to agree with topics or themes within a material, but instead allows a reader to explore and engage with differing perspectives to form and inform their own views. c.     Since Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503 (1969), it has been well established that students do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate[,] and, as such, students have a right to access a diverse range of age-relevant information, stories, perspectives, and ideas. d.    In Bd. of Ed.  v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853 (1982), the United States Supreme Court recognized that school libraries are completely voluntary on the part of students[,] a students selection of books from a school library is entirely a matter of free choice[,] and the school library affords a student an opportunity at self-education and individual enrichment that is wholly optional. e.     School libraries and public libraries, as centers for voluntary inquiry, play a unique role in promoting intellectual freedom, providing equitable access to learning resources, and promoting democracy by providing service to all regardless of race, ethnicity, creed, age, ability, gender, or socio-economic status. f.     School library media specialists and librarians are essential members of the community; as trained professionals, they help young people of all backgrounds find and interpret the information they need to succeed in school and prepare for college, careers, and life. g.    School library media specialists and librarians receive extensive professional training that prepares them to develop and curate collections designed to meet the broad and varied interests and needs of their communities and students, which is based on a variety of factors, including pedagogical value, student interest, and the age-appropriateness of the material. h.    Despite this, school library media specialists and librarians have been targeted, harassed, and defamed for providing young people access to library material. i.     Therefore, it is necessary and proper for the Legislature to protect the freedom of New Jerseys residents to read, for school libraries and public libraries to acquire and maintain materials without external limitations, to recognize that school library media specialists and librarians are trained to curate and develop collections, and to protect school library media specialists and librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted harassment and defamation for performance of their duties. 3.    (New section) As used in sections 4 through 7 of P.L.            , c.               (C.              ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Diverse and inclusive material means any material that reflects any protected class as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.);

(2)   Refuse to grant or accept any letter of credit or other document which evidences the transfer of funds or credit, or refuse to enter into any contract for the exchange of goods or services, on the ground that it does not contain such a discriminatory provision or certification. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any letter of credit, contract, or other document which contains any provision pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, a labor dispute or an unfair labor practice, or made in connection with the protest of unlawful discrimination or an unlawful employment practice, if the other provisions of such letter of credit, contract, or other document do not otherwise violate the provisions of this subsection. n.    For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, coerce, or induce the doing of any act forbidden by subsections l. and m. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or to attempt, or to conspire to do so.

(1) For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3) (a) For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i) The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, [or] liability for service in the armed forces, or the refusal of a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any staff member of a public library to remove library material from a school library or a public library, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 15.  This act shall take effect one year following the date of enactment, but the Commissioner of Education and State Librarian may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary for the implementation of the act. STATEMENT This bill, entitled the "Freedom to Read Act," establishes requirements for library material in public school libraries and public libraries and establishes protections for school library media specialists and librarians against harassment. Under the bill, boards of education and governing boards of public libraries are required to adopt policies on the curation of library material within school libraries and public libraries.  Library material is defined under the bill to mean any material including, but not limited to, nonfiction and fiction books; magazines; reference books; supplementary titles; multimedia and digital material; software and instructional material and other material not required as part of classroom instruction, belonging to, on loan to, or otherwise in the custody of a school library or public library. To assist boards of education in establishing a policy on the library material within school libraries, the Commissioner of Education is to create a model policy in consultation with the State Librarian and the New Jersey Association of School Librarians.  The bill also requires the State Librarian to establish a model policy, in consultation with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public libraries. The bill further requires boards of education and governing boards of public libraries to adopt policies creating a procedure regarding requests for removal of library material from a school library or public library.  These policies are to establish a mechanism to challenge a library material, create a review committee, and require a written statement of reasons on the final determination of the library material.  The State Librarian is to establish a model policy, in consultation with the New Jersey Library Association, for use and adoption by public libraries. The bill also requires boards of education and governing boards of public libraries to include diverse and inclusive material within their respective libraries.  Students are to be able to reserve, check out, or access any age- and grade-appropriate library material, including diverse and inclusive materials.  Similarly, residents are to be able to reserve, check out, or access any library material, including diverse and inclusive materials. The bill defines diverse and inclusive material to mean any material that reflects any protected class as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," (LAD); material produced by an author notwithstanding the authors membership in a protected class as enumerated in the LAD; and material that contains the author's points of view concerning contemporary problems and issues, whether international, national or local; but excludes content that is inappropriate for grades and age groups served by the school library.  The LAD bars discrimination on the basis of a persons race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, marital status, liability for service in the Armed Forces, disability, or nationality. Further, this bill provides that a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any other staff member of a public library that engages in activities required under the bill is to be immune from criminal and civil liability.  These individuals are also to have a civil cause of action for any relevant tort against any person who harasses the school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any other staff member of a public library for complying with the provisions of the bill.  Harassment or harasses is defined in the bill as a singular act that is severe or pervasive, or a series of acts over any period of time directed at a specific person that serves no legitimate purpose and would cause, or has caused, a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress.  Emotional distress is defined as significant mental suffering or distress. Additionally, the bill creates an affirmative defense for a prosecution for obscenity for school library media specialists, teaching staff members, librarians, or any staff member of a public library that are complying with the provisions of this bill. Finally, this bill expands the scope of the LAD, to incorporate protection against discriminatory acts against a school library media specialist, teaching staff member, librarian, or any staff member of a public library based upon their refusal to remove library material except as permitted under the bill. It is the sponsors intent that the Legislature protect the freedom of New Jerseys residents to read, for school libraries and public libraries to acquire and maintain materials without external limitations, to recognize that school library media specialists and librarians are trained to curate and develop collections, and to protect school library media specialists and librarians from unnecessary and unwarranted harassment and defamation for performance of their duties.
