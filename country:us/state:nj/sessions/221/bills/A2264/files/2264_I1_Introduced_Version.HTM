of Labor and Workforce Development.  The purpose of the program is to provide
incentives to small private sector employers who increase their workforce by
hiring unemployed workers.</p>

100 or fewer full-time employees eligible for a refundable New Jobs for New

tax, whichever applies to the employer, for each eligible individual employed
by the employer on a full-time basis during a tax year, if the following
requirements are met:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The eligible individual
is hired by the employer after April 1, 2021, is employed full-time during the

to April 1, 2021; and</p>

the refundable tax credit provided to an approved employer for each eligible individual
employed during a tax year as the total amount of the employer payroll taxes paid
during that tax year by the employer with respect to that individual, subject
to the requirements of the bill.  Employer payroll taxes include the portion
paid by employers of State unemployment, temporary disability, and workforce
development and basic skills assessments, and federal Social Security,
