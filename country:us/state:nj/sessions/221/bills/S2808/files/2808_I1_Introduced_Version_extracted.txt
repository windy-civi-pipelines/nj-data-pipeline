(cf: P.L.2022, c.131, s.8) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows honorably discharged veterans of the United States Armed Forces or National Guard to carry a handgun at all times in this State. Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times. This bill extends the right to carry a handgun to honorably discharged veterans provided the veteran is not otherwise disqualified from owning a firearm under current law.  As is the case with a retired law enforcement officer, a veteran would be required to semi-annually qualify in the use of the handgun.  The bill requires that prior to issuing a carry permit the Superintendent of State Police is to obtain a verification of service from a representative of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs certifying the veterans length of service and the date on which the veteran was honorably discharged. Members of the United States Armed Forces receive extensive firearms and weapons training as part of their service to this country.  The sponsor believes that men and women who have served this country honorably and are trained in the use of firearms should be entitled to carry a handgun at all times in this State to protect themselves and continue to provide safety to the community.

STATEMENT This bill allows honorably discharged veterans of the United States Armed Forces or National Guard to carry a handgun at all times in this State. Under current law, certain retired law enforcement officers may annually apply for a permit to carry a handgun, until those officers reach age 75, at which time they are no longer eligible. The permit allows a retired law enforcement officer to carry a handgun at all times. This bill extends the right to carry a handgun to honorably discharged veterans provided the veteran is not otherwise disqualified from owning a firearm under current law.  As is the case with a retired law enforcement officer, a veteran would be required to semi-annually qualify in the use of the handgun.  The bill requires that prior to issuing a carry permit the Superintendent of State Police is to obtain a verification of service from a representative of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs certifying the veterans length of service and the date on which the veteran was honorably discharged. Members of the United States Armed Forces receive extensive firearms and weapons training as part of their service to this country.  The sponsor believes that men and women who have served this country honorably and are trained in the use of firearms should be entitled to carry a handgun at all times in this State to protect themselves and continue to provide safety to the community.
