The secretary shall allow an independent institution of higher education to submit data elements to the longitudinal data system, and independent institutions of higher education are encouraged to do so. 4.    The working group established pursuant to section 1 of this act shall submit a report to the Governor, and to the Legislature pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1). The report shall  contain  information on  the implementation and effectiveness of the longitudinal data system, and on the need for State funds to continue, expand, or modify the operations of the longitudinal data system. 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the development of a Statewide longitudinal data system that is capable of retaining individual-level information. The data records would include information starting when an individual enrolls in a public school, and would continue as the individual enters the workforce. Under the bill, the Secretary of Higher Education, the Commissioner of Education, and the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development will jointly establish a P-20 Longitudinal Data System Working Group. The working group will determine: · the data elements to be maintained in the longitudinal data system; · the process by which entities will submit information to the data system; · the measures to be taken to ensure that all data in the longitudinal data system are secure and that individuals privacy is not compromised; · the development of analytic reports that will be created using information stored in the longitudinal data system; and · the feasibility of collecting postsecondary education and employment data for inclusion in the longitudinal data system of individuals who graduated from a public secondary school in the State and subsequently moved out-of-State. The bill requires that the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education, the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development enter into a memorandum of understanding no later than the beginning of the first full academic year following the bills effective date to develop the longitudinal data system. The system would be operational by the beginning of the second full academic year following the bills effective date.
