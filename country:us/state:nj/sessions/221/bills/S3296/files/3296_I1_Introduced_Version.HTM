a county program shall also be available to volunteer firefighters.  The term

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law permits the
governing body of any county to establish a law enforcement crisis intervention
services program for the provision of debriefing and counseling services for
law enforcement officers and sheriffs officers who have been involved in incidents
which may produce personal or job-related depression, anxiety, stress or other
psychological or emotional tensions, traumas, pressures or disorders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, which is designated
as the Craig Tiger Act, requires that each county establish such a program. 
This bill also makes firefighters in the county eligible for the debriefing and
counseling services of a program, and makes law enforcement officers who are
employed by a State department or agency eligible for the debriefing and
counseling services of a program when the officer resides in the county or when
the officers primary work location is in the county.  The bill makes volunteer
firefighters and 9-1-1 first responder dispatchers eligible for the program as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill expands the definition
of critical incident to include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the visual or audible
witnessing of the death or maiming, or the visual or audible witnessing of the
immediate aftermath of such a death or maiming, of one or more human beings; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) the response to or direct
involvement in a criminal investigation of an offense involving dangerous
crimes against children; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  the need for rescue in
the line of duty where ones life was in danger; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the response to or direct
involvement in an investigation regarding the drowning or near drowning of a
child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits an
employer from requiring a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or sheriffs
officer who is receiving services to use accrued paid vacation leave, personal
leave, or sick leave if the law enforcement officer, firefighter, or sheriffs
officer leaves work to attend these counseling sessions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill
provides that, if a provider of the crisis intervention services program
determines that the law enforcement officer, firefighter, or sheriffs officer is
not fit for duty while the law enforcement officer is receiving debriefing or
counseling services, the employer must ensure that the law enforcement officer has
no loss of pay and benefits for up to 30 calendar days per incident after the
date the provider determines that the employee is not fit for duty if certain
criteria are met.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill will provide
qualified officers and firefighters with up to 12 counseling sessions, which can
be provided in person or by telehealth.  If the provider determines that the officer
or firefighter requires additional counseling sessions, the program will
provide up to an additional 24 counseling sessions, if the sessions occur
within one year after the first session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, this bill
requires each county crisis intervention services advisory council to compile
data regarding the program and, on or before September 1 of each year, submit
the data to the Department of Community Affairs.  On or before October 1 of
each year, the department is required to compile the data into a report and submit
the report to the Governor and the Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill requires
the State to reimburse a county for the costs of the crisis intervention
services program it is required to establish pursuant to this bill.</p>
