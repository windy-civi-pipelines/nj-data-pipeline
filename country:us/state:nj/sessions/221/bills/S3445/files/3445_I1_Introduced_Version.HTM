boundaries, and expectations of the Legislature for the conventions outcome.
The advisory committee shall put forth the resolution for the Legislatures
approval. A commissioner who has been named on the commissioning resolution
shall be permitted to withdraw from consideration if the commissioner is unable

additional instructions at any time via subsequent resolution, a copy of which
the Secretary of the Senate or Clerk of the General Assembly shall provide to each
commissioner and to the advisory committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6. a. Each commissioner shall,
before exercising any function of the position, execute the following oath in
writing: I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I accept and will act according

subsequent instructions. I understand that violating this oath may subject me
to penalties provided by law. I understand that I may be recalled or suspended

an interim commissioner shall accept, during the time of service, any gifts or
benefits with a combined value of more than $200, other than from an immediate family
member and of the kind customarily granted by a member of ones family. The term
gift or benefit shall be construed liberally to include current and future
loans, lodging, food, offer of prospective employment, and other actual and
prospective benefits. An employers decision to continue paying a commissioners
current salary shall not be construed to be a gift. Once a commissioner has
accepted a position as a member of the delegation, such salary shall not be
altered until the adjournment of the Article V convention and proposed
amendments have been submitted to the states for ratification.</p>

or by the legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. The provisions of
subsections b. and c. of this section shall not be construed to prevent a commissioner

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f. The quorum for decision by
the delegation, including the designation of commissioners for particular duties

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a process
for the selection, instruction, and oversight of commissioners to an Article V
convention for proposing amendments to the United States Constitution, and establishes
criminal penalties for certain violations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, an odd number
of commissioners would be named as this States delegates to an Article V
convention by a resolution passed by the State legislature, by a majority of
those legislators present and voting in a joint session. To be eligible for
selection and service as a commissioner, a person would be required to be: a
United States citizen and have been such for at least 5 years; a resident of
this State and have been such for at least 3 of the last 5 years; at least 25
years old; a registered voter in this State; not registered or required to be
registered as a federal lobbyist at any time within the last 5 years; not a
federal employee, other than a member of the United States armed forces, or
contractor, currently or at any time within the last 10 years; not a federal
elected or appointed officer at any time within the last 10 years; not a
convicted felon for crimes involving moral turpitude in any jurisdiction, nor for
any crime in any jurisdiction within the last 10 years; not a Statewide office
while performing the duties of commissioner or interim commissioner; able to
attend the convention unencumbered with other responsibilities that could
detract from full-time commitment to the responsibilities of the convention,
taking into consideration the anticipated duration of the convention; and have
relevant subject matter expertise in areas that may include, but may not be
limited to, constitutional law, civics, rules of order, American history,
political science, political theory, and government. A position as a State
legislator would not be deemed a Statewide office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides for a
commissioner to receive the same compensation as a member of the legislature of
this State, prorated for length of time served, and the same allowance for
expenses. The bill prohibits a commissioner or interim commissioner from
accepting, during the time of service, any gifts or benefits with a combined
value of more than $200, other than from an immediate family member and of the
kind customarily granted by a member of ones family. The term gift or
benefit would be construed liberally to include current and future loans,
lodging, food, offer of prospective employment, and other actual and
prospective benefits. An employers decision to continue paying a
commissioners current salary would not be construed to be a gift. However,
such salary would not be altered until the adjournment of the Article V
convention and proposed amendments have been submitted to the states for
ratification.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
resolution naming the commissioners and their commission would prohibit a
commissioner from voting for or otherwise promoting any change to the
traditional convention rule of decision on the floor and in the committee of
the whole, to-wit, that each state has one vote. A commissioner would also be
prohibited from voting in favor of any proposed amendment that would alter the
text of the specific guarantees of individual liberty established by the United
States Constitution, including the original constitution, the Bill of Rights,
and the following amendments: Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth,
Twenty-Third, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth. The commissioning resolution
would be required to clearly state the scope of the commissioners authority,
which would be limited by: (1) if this State was not one of the two-thirds of
the states applying for the convention, the subject matter enumerated in the 34
state applications that triggered the convention; or (2) if this State was one of
the two-thirds of the states applying for the convention, the subject matter in
this States application; and (3) any additional instructions from the
legislature, whether in the commissioning resolution or issued thereafter. The
bill allows the legislature to provide additional instructions at any time via
subsequent resolution. In addition to the commissioning resolution, the Senate
and General Assembly would adopt a resolution to outline the commissions
initial statement and charter. The advisory committee would put forth the
resolution for the Legislatures approval. A commissioner who has been named on
the commissioning resolution would be permitted to withdraw from consideration
if the commissioner is unable to uphold the goals established in the resolution
of initial statement and charter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes a
three-member advisory committee composed of a member of the Senate appointed by
the President of the Senate; a member of the General Assembly appointed by the
Speaker of the General Assembly; and a member of the legislature nominated by
joint action of the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General
Assembly and approved by the majority of those voting in each chamber. The advisory
committee has the responsibility to determine whether a prospective or actual
action by a commissioner would violate or violates the commissioning resolution
or any subsequent instruction. Upon determining that a commissioner or interim
commissioner has exceeded the scope of the commissioners authority, the
advisory committee would be required to recall or suspend said commissioner,
and would communicate said action and the reasons therefor to the President of
the Senate, Speaker of the General Assembly, the Attorney General, and the
presiding officers of the convention. Under the bill, the legislature is
empowered to remove said commissioner and appoint an interim commissioner to
fill the vacancy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes criminal
penalties for certain violations. Under the bill, a commissioner or interim
commissioner who exceeds the scope of the commissioners authority would be
guilty of a crime of the third degree. In addition, any individual who, while
not being privileged by law, knowingly bribes, threatens, intimidates or
obstructs a commissioner, interim commissioner, or a person representing
another state in the capacity of a commissioner or interim commissioner at a
convention held in this State, in the performance of the commissioners duties,
or attempts to do so, would be guilty of a crime of the third degree.</p>
