<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning</span> the study and promotion of wave and
tidal energy, and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Ocean energy represents
the third largest source of renewable energy and the largest source of
underutilized renewable energy.  Ocean energy primarily comes in two forms: 
(1) wave energy, harnessed by waves; and (2) tidal energy, harnessed by tides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State, through
Executive Order No. 28 of 2018 and the 2019 Energy Master Plan, prepared
pursuant to Executive Order No. 28 of 2018 and section 12 of P.L.1977, c.146
(C.52:27F-14), has established an ambitious goal of providing 100 percent clean
energy in the State by 2050, with at least 50 percent of the States
electricity supply to be derived from renewable energy by 2030.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Executive Order No. 28
of 2018 and the 2019 Energy Master Plan each highlight and promote the need for
the State to increase its development and use of renewable energy technologies,
facilities, and resources, with efforts and goals directed towards solar and
wind energy.  To expand and enhance both Executive Order No. 28 of 2018 and the
2019 Energy Master Plan, provisions specifically highlighting and promoting the
need for, and benefits of, developing and using untapped ocean energy,
including wave energy, tidal energy, or both, in the State, as a means to
achieve the States clean energy goals, should also be included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In order to achieve the
States clean energy goals with the least cost and greatest benefit to
consumers, it is critical that the State not only promote and facilitate
investments in wind and solar energy technologies, infrastructure, and
facilities, but also promote and facilitate concurrent investments in new wave
and tidal energy technologies, infrastructure, and facilities, so that the
State can begin to make full use of the oceans inexhaustible and untapped sources
of clean energy and, thereby, bolster and expand its renewable energy
portfolio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The generation of
energy from ocean forces is a new and emerging field, and, going forward, the
availability of effective and efficient technology and technological
innovations will be essential to ensuring that ocean energy can be generated at
the lowest cost to consumers and in sufficient amounts to meet the States
energy needs.  By promoting and facilitating growth in the emerging wave and
tidal energy sectors and incorporating ambitious, but achievable, wave and
tidal energy generation goals into the States Energy Master Plan, New Jersey
can position itself as a nationwide leader in ocean energy, while facilitating
the development of high quality jobs and technological advancements in this
burgeoning industry. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Based on the foregoing,
it is both reasonable and necessary, and in the public interest, for the State
to enact legislation requiring:  (1) a comprehensive study of the potential
associated with the adoption and use of wave and tidal energy in New Jersey;
(2) the amendment of the States Energy Master Plan to incorporate the use of
wave and tidal energy as an integral component of the States clean energy
planning and goals; and (3) the taking of additional steps, as may be necessary
to position New Jersey as a leader in these emerging clean ocean energy
sectors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Within 30 days after
the effective date of this act, the Board of Public Utilities and the
Department of Environmental Protection shall commence a comprehensive,
collaborative study to evaluate the feasibility and benefits of using wave and
tidal energy as forms of clean energy in the State.  The study shall include an
evaluation of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the actual and potential
impacts associated with the increased use of wave and tidal energy in the
State, including, but not limited to, the impacts to labor markets, energy
prices, air quality and greenhouse gas emissions, ocean ecosystems and water
quality, grid transmission, PJM grid operation, grid reliability, and grid
security; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the feasibility and
desirability of establishing a renewable energy credit program, like the solar
renewable energy credit (SREC) program established pursuant to section 38 of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-87), the SREC-II program established pursuant to
P.L.2021, c.169 (C.48:3-114 et seq.), and the offshore wind renewable energy
certificate (OREC) program established pursuant to section 38 of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-87), by which Wave Renewable Energy Credits (WRECs) can be used to
encourage the development and successful deployment of wave or tidal energy
technologies, infrastructure, and facilities in the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the feasibility and
desirability of using alternative means and methods, other than renewable
energy credits, such as public-private partnerships, financial investments, or
university involvement, to encourage and incentivize the development of wave
and tidal energy technologies, infrastructure, and facilities, as well as the
creation of private sector wave and tidal energy jobs, in the State and
otherwise facilitate the establishment of New Jersey a national leader in the
growing wave and tidal energy sectors; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the factors that should
be considered, and determinations that should be made, by the board, when
soliciting and approving proposals for wave and tidal energy projects in the
State, including, at a minimum, the evaluation of existing wave and tidal
projects around the globe that produce technical data, and the determination
that each proposed project in the State will result in a positive net economic
and environmental benefit to the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board and department
shall authorize individuals and entities to engage in pilot wave and tidal
energy projects in the State, as provided by subsection a. of section 3 of this
act, with associated data to be included in the study conducted pursuant to subsection
a. of this section and in the report produced pursuant to subsection d. of this
section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In conducting the wave
and tidal energy study pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the board and
department shall cooperatively engage in a robust stakeholder engagement
process, which process shall include consultation with, and the solicitation of
