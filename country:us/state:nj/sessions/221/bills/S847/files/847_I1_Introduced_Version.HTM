<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  When
an official mail-in ballot is mailed to an address at which the listed voter no
longer resides, the person residing at that address may return the ballot to
the county clerk of the county in which the ballot was issued.  The person
residing at that address may return the unopened official mail-in ballot
envelope in person to the county clerk or deposit the envelope in a ballot drop
box or any outgoing United States Postal Service mailbox or letter collection
box with a return to sender notation affixed thereto.  The person residing at
that address may write one of the following notations on the front of the
unopened official mail-in ballot envelope:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) Return to Sender - No
Longer at this Address;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Return to Sender - Moved
out of State or County;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Return to Sender 
Deceased; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) any other notations deemed
appropriate by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Secretary of State
shall prepare and transmit, within 60 days of the effective date of this act,
P.L.   , c.   (C.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill),
instructions on how to return an unopened official mail-in ballot envelope to
sender.  The instructions prepared by the Secretary of State shall be contained
in any printed or electronic voter information notices or educational materials
provided or disseminated by the Department of State.  The New Jersey Division
of Elections and each county clerk and board of elections in this State shall
also make available on their websites, if one exists, the instructions prepared
by the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 3 of P.L.2009,
c.79 (C.19:63-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.  a.  A qualified voter
shall be entitled to vote using a mail-in ballot:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) in all future elections,
including general elections, held in this State, in which the voter is eligible
to vote; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) in any single election
held in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The qualified voter who
chooses the option to vote using a mail-in ballot in all future elections shall
be furnished with such a ballot by the county clerk without further request on
the part of the voter and until the voter requests in writing that the voter no
longer be sent a mail-in ballot. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The mail-in ballot application
form prepared by the Secretary of State shall present the two options in the
order provided above.  The mail-in ballot application shall also provide spaces
for the voter's telephone number and email address, including language
informing the voter that this contact information will be used to contact the
voter concerning the acceptance or rejection of the ballot, and how the voter
may cure a defect.  A voter's telephone number and email address shall not be
subject to public disclosure and shall not be considered a government record.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The additional direct
expenditures required for the implementation of the provisions of this
subsection as amended by section 1 of P.L.2018, c.72 shall be offset pursuant
to section 1 of P.L.2019, c.459 (C.19:63-29).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Not less than seven days
before an election in which a voter wants to vote by mail, the voter may apply
to the person designated in section 5 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5), for a
mail-in ballot.  The application shall be in writing, shall be signed by the
applicant and shall state the applicant's place of voting residence and the
address to which the ballot shall be sent.  The Secretary of State shall
prepare a mail-in application form and shall have the authority to promulgate
any rules and regulations the secretary deems necessary to effectuate the
purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Any voter wanting to
vote by mail in any election may apply to the person designated in section 5 of
P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-5) for a mail-in ballot to be sent to the voter.  A
voter who is a member of the armed forces of the United States may use a
federal postcard application form to apply for a mail-in ballot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Any voter who fails to
apply for a mail-in ballot before the seven-day period prescribed in subsection
b. of this section may apply in person to the county clerk for a mail-in ballot
up to 3 p.m. of the day before the election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A person voting by
mail-in ballot who registered by mail after January 1, 2003, who did not
provide personal identification information when registering pursuant to
section 16 of P.L.1974, c.30 (C.19:31-6.4) and is voting for the first time in
his or her current county of residence following registration shall include
copies of the required identification information with the mail-in ballot. 
Failure to include such information with the mail-in ballot shall result in its
rejection. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The county clerk shall
not transmit a mail-in ballot for any election to any person who: is deemed by
a county commissioner of registration to be an inactive voter; or notifies the
clerk in writing that the person no longer wishes to receive such a ballot for

the signature and information contained in the respective requests for mail-in
ballots and the signature and information contained in the Statewide voter
registration system.  In addition, as to mail-in ballots issued less than seven
days prior to an election, the county board of elections shall also check to
establish that the mail-in voter did not vote in person.  The county board
shall reject such a ballot if it is not satisfied, pursuant to a comparison with
the Statewide voter registration system, that the voter is legally entitled to
vote and that the ballot conforms with the requirements of this act.  The
county board of elections shall conduct the determination of qualification of

the voter is not entitled to vote according to the Statewide voter registration
system, and if it shall appear from the record that the voter is not entitled

shall inform the voter of that fact and provide the reasoning for rejection,
and attempt to contact the voter by telephone, if a telephone number is
available.  The cure letter shall include a &quot;Cure Form&quot; and the form

license number or Motor Vehicle Commission non-driver identification number; or
(b) if the voter does not have a valid New Jersey driver's license number or
Motor Vehicle Commission non-driver identification number, then by providing
the last four digits of their Social Security Number; or (c) if the voter does
not have the identification in (a) or (b), then attaching a legible copy of a

circumstances, the cure form may not be verified or authenticated using
signature matching.</p>

not match.</p>

municipality is located once each month, during the first five days thereof,
the age, date of death, and the names and addresses of all persons 18 years of
age or older who have died within such municipality during the previous month. 
Within 30 days after the receipt of such list, the commissioner shall make and

shall forward a copy of the notice of death to the officer in charge of records
of death in the municipality in which the decedent resided.  That officer having

residing at that address may return the unopened official mail-in ballot
envelope in person to the county clerk or deposit the envelope in a ballot drop

ballot that is sent to a qualified voter and that is returned to the county
clerk for any reason is required to be forwarded by the county clerk to the
commissioner of registration within 30 days from the date the mail-in ballot is
returned to the county clerk.  If the reason the mail-in ballot is returned is
due to the death of the qualified voter, the commissioner of registration is
required to determine if the death was filed by the officer in charge of
records of death in the municipality in which the decedent resided as
prescribed in current law and must undertake the procedures provided in current
law.  The bill requires that any deceased registrant on the monthly or yearly

to complete the Certificate of Mail-in Voter that is attached to the flap of
the mail-in ballot inner envelope.  By completing the certificate, the mail-in
voter certifies, subject to the penalties for fraudulent voting: the voters
address, that the voter is the person who applied for the enclosed ballot, that
the voter marked the ballot in secret, and that a family member may provide
assistance to the voter.  The mail-in voter and any person who provided
assistance to the voter are required to sign the certificate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, when the
voter failed to include the Certificate of Mail-in Voter or includes a detached

substantially similar certificate for the voter to complete in order to cure
the voters mail-in ballot in accordance with the same requirements,
procedures, and timeframes specified for ballot curing due to a missing or
discrepant signature.</p>
