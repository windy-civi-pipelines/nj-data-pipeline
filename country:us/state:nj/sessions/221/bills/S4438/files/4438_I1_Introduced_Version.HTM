Under current law, juveniles 15 years of age and older at the time of the alleged delinquent act who are charged with certain offenses, such as criminal homicide, other than death by auto; first degree robbery; carjacking; and aggravated sexual assault, are eligible to be waived to adult criminal court.  Under the provisions of this bill, these juveniles also would be eligible to be waived to adult criminal court for terrorism or human trafficking. The bill further provides that a juvenile, regardless of age, who is charged with terrorism, human trafficking, or certain other offenses, as set forth under current law, is eligible to be waived to adult criminal court if the circumstances and severity of the offense warrant waiver.
