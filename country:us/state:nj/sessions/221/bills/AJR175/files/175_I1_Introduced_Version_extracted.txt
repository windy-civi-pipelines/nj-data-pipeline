ATKINS District 20 (Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Quijano SYNOPSIS Designates March 1 of every year as Endometriosis Awareness Day in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating March 1 of every year, as Endometriosis Awareness Day in New Jersey Whereas, Endometriosis is a chronic disease impacting millions of menstruating individuals as well as premenarchal and post-menopausal individuals, many of whom reside in the State of New Jersey; and Whereas, Endometriosis affects a menstruating individuals reproductive system when tissue typically found in the uterus grows in areas outside of the uterus causing severe discomfort and other complications; and Whereas, In addition to its physical effects, endometriosis can also take a toll on an individuals emotional and mental well being; and Whereas, Roughly one in 10 menstruating individuals worldwide suffer from endometriosis and 30-50 percent of those diagnosed will experience difficulties conceiving; and Whereas, The normalization of menstrual pain by many individuals and medical professionals and a lack of public awareness has led to endometriosis diagnoses being delayed by seven to 10 years; and Whereas, Early diagnosis and effective treatments such as hormone therapy and surgical intervention are critical to managing symptoms but are not always available to low and middle-income individuals; and Whereas, The economic burden of endometriosis on our health care system totals approximately $80 billion annually underlining the need for greater research and medical innovation to care for endometriosis patients; and Whereas, It is essential to recognize the efforts of the estimated 11 percent of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that dedicate their lives to fighting this disease; and Whereas, Raising awareness for endometriosis can bring about more research funding for this disease that can lead to treatment breakthroughs and faster diagnoses; and Whereas, March is nationally recognized as Endometriosis Awareness Month. Therefore by designating March 1 of each year as Endometriosis Awareness Day, New Jersey will join the broader movement to spread awareness about this disease; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1  March 1 of each year is designated Endometriosis Awareness Day in New Jersey to raise awareness of endometriosis, and to recognize the efforts of the 11 percent of American College Obstetricians and Gynecologists who dedicate their lives to fighting this disease. 2.  The Governor shall annually issue a proclamation and call upon public officials, and all citizens of this State, to observe Endometriosis Awareness Day with appropriate programs and activities. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates March 1 of each year as Endometriosis Awareness Day in New Jersey, with the aim of raising public awareness about endometriosis, a chronic disease that affects approximately one in 10 menstruating individuals worldwide. Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, leading to severe discomfort and potential difficulties conceiving. The impact of endometriosis is significant, costing the United States healthcare system approximately $80 billion annually. Despite its prevalence, the normalization of menstrual pain by society and the medical profession often leads to delayed diagnoses, with many individuals suffering in silence for seven to 10 years before receiving proper medical attention. Nationally, the month of March is recognized as Endometriosis Awareness Month, dedicated to spreading information about endometriosis and acknowledging the healthcare workers fighting against it. By designating March 1 as Endometriosis Awareness Day, New Jersey will contribute to the national movement to increase public awareness about endometriosis and ensure that those affected can access the care and support they need.
