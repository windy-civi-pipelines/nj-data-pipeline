Haiti has been through political and economic turmoil and has suffered from natural disasters for years.  However, following the assassination of the Haitian President, the country fell into an even greater crisis, the rise in gang activity. This organized criminal gang activity has resulted in civilian casualties and displaced thousands of people in and around Haitis capital of Port-au-Prince. As a result of political instability and ongoing natural disasters, the Biden administration has stated that Haiti is grappling with a deteriorating political crisis, violence, and a staggering increase in human rights abuses. Given the political turmoil and the financial distress, Haitians have started to migrate more to the United States via boats or land corridors from the Americas.  Haitians are among the numerous migrants from Caribbean, Central, and Latin countries who undergo treacherous journeys northward in search of safety and opportunity in the United States. This resolution urges Congress to provide support to frontline organizations that work to aid Haitian migrants who were dislocated, detained, and expelled as they sought asylum and safety at the U.S. border.  Aid to the migrants should include funding to provide shelter, food aid, and medical assistance and further, to organizations that provide legal services.
