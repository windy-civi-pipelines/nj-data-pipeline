CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution pursuant to P.L.1960, c.52 proposing an amendment to the Rules of Evidence. Whereas, Decisions associated with the provision, continuation, or cessation of mental health services can profoundly impact the lives of those persons in need of or currently undergoing treatment, as well as their family, friends, and caretakers; and Whereas, The use of hearsay testimony about a persons medical history or present condition may be a vital source in making decisions about the provision, continuation, or cessation of mental health services; and Whereas, Clarifying the availability of such hearsay testimony as an exception to the general prohibition against using hearsay testimony in legal proceedings will eliminate efforts to prevent its admissibility; and Whereas, Section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38) provides a procedure for the adoption of rules of evidence without necessity for presentation at the Judicial Conference so that their adoption by the Supreme Court may be accelerated; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Pursuant to section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38), the Supreme Court of New Jersey may adopt the amendatory rule specified in this section in the form set out, at any time after this joint resolution has been delivered to and signed by the Governor of the State of New Jersey, by entering an order that the amendment is adopted and by causing true copies of its order of adoption to be delivered to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly and the Governor, without presenting the subject matter and a tentative draft of rules at a Judicial Conference.

STATEMENT This joint resolution would clarify an exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803 of the Rules of Evidence, concerning a persons medical diagnosis or treatment for purposes of providing, continuing, or ending mental health services.  The use of hearsay testimony about a persons medical history or present condition may be a vital source in making such treatment decisions.
