(cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.3) 4.    Section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328) is amended to read as follows: 60. a. (1) Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to sections 58 and 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326 and C.34:1B-327), the authority shall enter into an incentive award agreement with the developer.  The chief executive officer of the authority shall negotiate the terms and conditions of the incentive award agreement on behalf of the State. (2) For a phased project, the incentive phase agreement shall set forth, for each phase of the project and for the total project, the capital investment requirements and the time periods in which each phase of the project shall be commenced and completed.  The awarding of tax credits shall be conditioned on the developer's compliance with the requirements of the agreement.  A redevelopment project may be completed in phases in accordance with rules adopted by the authority if the redevelopment project has a total project cost in excess of $50,000,000. b.    An incentive award agreement shall specify the amount of the incentive award the authority shall award to the developer and the duration of the eligibility period.  The duration of the eligibility period [shall not exceed 15 years for a commercial or mixed-use project and] shall not exceed 10 years for a commercial project, mixed-use project, or residential project, except that [to] the authority shall consider reducing the eligibility period if a shorter period would reduce the total value of tax credits needed to reimburse a developer for all or part of the project financing gap of a redevelopment project, [the authority may, in its discretion, approve a duration for the eligibility period that is shorter than the applicable maximum periods] enhance access to tax credit monetization on cost effective terms, or otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the program.  The incentive award agreement shall provide an estimated date of completion and include a requirement for periodic progress reports, including the submittal of executed financing commitments and documents that evidence site control; provided however, that the developer may sell one or more buildings during the eligibility period, provided that such sale is: an arms-length transaction to an unrelated party, or for an amount at least equal to fair market value based on an appraisal conducted within one year; and subject to the purchasers assumption of all obligations relating to the buildings pursuant to sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335).  If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive award.  If the authority rescinds an incentive award in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive award, then the authority may assign the incentive award to another applicant.  The incentive award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developer's projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. c.     To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis.  If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive award.  At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developer's rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval.  If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment.  The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period.  Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developer's rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval.  If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds.  If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund. d.    The incentive award agreement shall include a requirement that the authority confirm with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action for the developer, and the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the redevelopment project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The incentive award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive award in any year in which the developer is neither in substantial good standing with each department nor has entered into a practical corrective action.  The incentive award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. e. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the authority shall not enter into an incentive award agreement for a redevelopment project that includes at least one retail establishment which will have more than 10 employees, at least one distribution center which will have more than 20 employees, or at least one hospitality establishment which will have more than 10 employees, unless the incentive award agreement includes a precondition that any business that serves as the owner or operator of the retail establishment, distribution center, or hospitality establishment enters into a labor harmony agreement with a labor organization or cooperating labor organizations which represent retail establishment, hospitality establishment, or distribution center employees in the State. (2) A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into an incentive award agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be able to go forward if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2023, c.98) f. (1) Except for a residential project that is located in a government-restricted municipality, and in which 100 percent of the residential units constructed in the residential project are reserved for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households, for a redevelopment project whose total project cost equals or exceeds $10 million, in addition to the incentive award agreement, a developer shall enter into a community benefits agreement with the authority and the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located.  The agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for training, employment, and youth development and free services to underserved communities in and around the community in which the redevelopment project is located. Prior to entering a community benefits agreement, the governing body of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located shall hold at least one public hearing at which the governing body shall hear testimony from residents, community groups, and other stakeholders on the needs of the community that the agreement should address. (2) The community benefits agreement shall provide for the creation of a community advisory committee to oversee the implementation of the agreement, monitor successes, ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement, and produce an annual public report.  The community advisory committee created pursuant to this paragraph shall be comprised of representatives of diverse community groups and residents of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located. (3) At the time the developer submits the annual report required pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330) to the authority, the developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that it is in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement.  If the developer fails to provide the certification required pursuant to this paragraph or the authority determines that the developer is not in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement based on the reports submitted by the community advisory committee pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the authority may rescind an award or recapture all or part of any tax credits awarded. (4) Notwithstanding any requirement of this subsection to the contrary, a developer shall be considered to have met the requirements of a community benefits agreement [pursuant to this subsection], and the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection shall not apply, if the developer submits to the authority: (a) a copy of either the developer's approval letter from the authority or a redevelopment agreement applicable to the qualified business facility, provided that the approval letter is certified by the municipality or the redevelopment agreement is [certified] adopted by resolution at a public meeting by the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, and includes provisions that meet [or exceed] the [standards] community benefit required [for] under a community benefits agreement in this subsection [, as determined by the chief executive officer pursuant to rules adopted by the authority]; or (b) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, which resolution shall be adopted after at least one public hearing at which the governing body provides an opportunity for residents, community groups, and other stakeholders to testify, and which resolution shall state that the governing body has determined that the redevelopment project will provide economic and social benefits to the community that fulfill the purposes of this subsection, which benefits render a separate community benefit agreement unnecessary, and explain the reasons supporting the governing body's determination. g.    A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive award agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or other event evidencing project completion that begins the eligibility period indicated in the incentive award agreement.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury.  Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. h.    The incentive award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. i.     The incentive award agreement shall include one or more provisions, as determined by the authority, concerning the terms and conditions for default and the remedies for the developer of a redevelopment project in the event of default.  The incentive award agreement shall not allow the authority to declare a cross-default when the developer of a redevelopment project, including any business affiliate of the developer or any other entity with common principals as the developer, is in default with any other assistance program administered by the authority. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.6) 5.    Section 61 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329) is amended to read as follows: 61.  a. Up to the limits established in subsection b. of this section and in accordance with an incentive award agreement, beginning upon the receipt of occupancy permits for any portion of the redevelopment project, or upon any other event evidencing project completion as set forth in the incentive award agreement, a developer shall be allowed a total tax credit [that shall not exceed] as follows, subject to the enhancements set forth in subsection c. of this section: (1) 80 percent of the total project cost for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (2) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a redevelopment project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (3)   50 percent of the total project cost for any other redevelopment project. b.    The value of all tax credits approved by the authority under the program for a redevelopment project phase shall not exceed: (1)   $120,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (2)   $90,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is allowed a tax credit under paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section; and (3)   $60,000,000 for any other redevelopment project or phase. c.     Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in subsection a. of this section, but subject to the limitations of subsections b. and d. of this section and the demonstration of a financing gap, a developer shall be eligible for each of the following enhancements to the total tax credit award: (1)   for a redevelopment project that includes the redevelopment of a stranded asset, an enhancement of up to 10 percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project; (2)   for a residential project that meets the three-bedroom distribution requirement under the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls, an enhancement of up to five percent of the project cost of the residential project; and (3)   for a redevelopment project that meets local first source hiring requirements for residents in the municipality or county where the project is located, an enhancement of up to three percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project. d.    Except for a redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality: (1)   the total tax credits awarded for the redevelopment project, together with all tax credits awarded under any other program administered by the authority, shall not exceed 80 percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project; and (2)   for a redevelopment project that receives tax credits under the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, the total tax credits awarded for the redevelopment project, together with all tax credits awarded under any other program administered by the authority and under the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, shall not exceed 90 percent of the project cost.

A developer approved for an incentive award pursuant to sections 58 and 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326 and C.34:1B-327) and that enters an incentive award agreement pursuant to section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328) shall submit annually, commencing in the year in which the incentive award is issued and for the remainder of the eligibility period, a report indicating whether the developer is aware of any condition, event, or act that would cause the developer not to be in compliance with the incentive award agreement or the provisions of sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335) and any additional reporting requirements contained in the incentive award agreement or tax credit certificate.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. b.    (1) Upon receipt and review of each report submitted during the eligibility period, the authority shall provide to the developer and the director a certificate of compliance indicating the amount of tax credits that the developer may apply against the developer's tax liability. (2)   Upon receipt by the director of the certificate of compliance, the director shall allow the developer a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  A developer shall apply the credit awarded against the developer's liability under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 for the privilege period [during] identified in the tax credit certificate which the director [allows] issues to the developer [a tax credit] pursuant to this subsection, or within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer. A developer may carry forward an unused credit resulting from the limitations of paragraph (3) of this subsection, if necessary, for use in the seven privilege periods next following the privilege period for which the credits are [awarded] applied. Credits granted to a partnership shall be passed through to the partners, members, or owners, respectively, pro-rata, or pursuant to an executed agreement among the partners, members, or owners documenting an alternate distribution method provided to the director accompanied by any additional information as the director may prescribe. (3)   The director shall prescribe the order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law against the tax imposed under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).

(4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 55 and 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 and C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, each phase of a transformative project completed in phases shall have a separate eligibility period.  After completing each phase, the developer shall submit a certification that the phase is completed.  If the authority approves the certification, the tax credit allowed to the developer shall be increased by the tax credit amount corresponding to that phase. Notwithstanding the different eligibility periods for each phase, all conditions and requirements applicable during an eligibility period pursuant to sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335) shall apply to the entire transformative project until the end of the eligibility period for the last phase. (5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, for a transformative project completed in phases, a review of the project financing gap shall be performed at the certification of completion of each phase, and the authority shall re-evaluate the developer's rate of return in the seventh year and at the end of the eligibility period for the last phase, provided that the authority may also re-evaluate the developer's rate of return during the fifth year of any earlier phase. (6)   A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section, other than a project that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production, shall be located in an incentive area, a distressed municipality, a government-restricted municipality, or an enhanced area.  A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production may be located anywhere in the State.  The authority shall not consider an application for a transformative project unless the applicant submits with its application a letter evidencing support for the transformative project from the governing body of the municipality in which the transformative project is located. c.     The authority shall review the transformative project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  In determining whether a transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developer's State or local tax liability.  The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state.  The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant.  A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer's application for an incentive award that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary.  The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed transformative project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. Projects that are predominantly residential shall be excluded from the calculation of the net benefit test required pursuant to this subsection. d.    In determining net benefits for any business or person considering locating in a transformative project and applying to receive from the authority any other economic development incentive subsequent to the award of transformative project tax credits pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333), the authority shall not credit the business or person with any benefit that was previously credited to the transformative project pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333). e.     The authority shall administer the credits awarded pursuant to this section in accordance with the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330 and C.34:1B-331). f.     Prior to allocating an incentive award to a developer, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan, and the developer shall certify that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the transformative project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. g.    Notwithstanding the limitation on incentive awards set forth in subsection b. of section 61 and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329 and C.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may allow a developer of a transformative project a tax credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1)   (a) 80 percent of the total project cost for a transformative project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (b)   60 percent of the total project cost for a residential transformative project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (c)   50 percent of the total project cost for any other transformative project; (2)   the total value of the project financing gap; or (3)   $400,000,000, except that for a transformative project that is developed in phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the transformative project. h.    (1) The parking component of a transformative project shall be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project, provided that the parking component shall be constructed in conformity with local zoning, planning, or similar requirements and up to the amount required by the Residential Site Improvement Standards.  Any portion of the parking component that exceeds the local parking requirements or the Residential Site Improvement Standards shall not be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project. (2)   Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (1) of this subsection to the contrary, the entire parking component of a project located in a government restricted municipality shall be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project.

(I)   With respect to privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, interest paid, accrued or incurred for the privilege period to a related member, as defined in section 5 of P.L.2002, c.40 (C.54:10A-4.4), except that a deduction shall be permitted to the extent that the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the director, that: (i) a principal purpose of the transaction giving rise to the payment of the interest was not to avoid taxes otherwise due under Title 54 of the Revised Statutes or Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes, (ii) the interest is paid pursuant to arm's length contracts at an arm's length rate of interest, and (iii)(aa) the related member was subject to a tax on its net income or receipts in this State or another state or possession of the United States or in a foreign nation, (bb) a measure of the tax includes the interest received from the related member, and (cc) the rate of tax applied to the interest received by the related member is equal to or greater than a rate three percentage points less than the rate of tax applied to taxable interest by this State pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). With respect to privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, a deduction shall also be permitted if the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the director, that the disallowance of a deduction is unreasonable, or the taxpayer and the director agree in writing to the application or use of an alternative method of apportionment under section 8 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-8); nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or negate the director's authority to otherwise enter into agreements and compromises otherwise allowed by law. With respect to privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, a deduction shall also be permitted to the extent that the taxpayer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence, as determined by the director, that the interest is directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred to (i) a related member in a foreign nation which has in force a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States and the related member (aa) was subject to tax in the foreign nation on a tax base that included the payment paid, accrued, or incurred; and (bb) under which the related member's income received from the transaction was taxed at an effective tax rate equal to or greater than a rate of three percentage points less than the rate of tax applied to taxable interest by the State of New Jersey pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), provided however that the taxpayer shall disclose on its return for the privilege period the name of the related member, the amount of the interest, the relevant foreign nation, and such other information as the director may prescribe or (ii) to an independent lender and the taxpayer guarantees the debt on which the interest is required. The adjustments required by this subparagraph shall not apply to transactions between related members included in a combined group reported on a New Jersey combined return. (J)   (i) Amounts deducted for federal tax purposes pursuant to section 199 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.199, except that this exclusion shall not apply to amounts deducted pursuant to that section that are exclusively based upon domestic production gross receipts of the taxpayer which are derived only from any lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualifying production property which the taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director was manufactured or produced by the taxpayer in whole or in significant part within the United States but not qualified production property that was grown or extracted by the taxpayer. "Manufactured or produced" as used in this paragraph shall be limited to performance of an operation or series of operations the object of which is to place items of tangible personal property in a form, composition, or character different from that in which they were acquired. The change in form, composition, or character shall be a substantial change, and result in a transformation of property into a different or substantially more usable product. (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017, notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) or any other law to the contrary, for the purposes of determining the amount of income pursuant to P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) that is net of expenses, no amounts shall be taken as a deduction pursuant to section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.199A). (K)  (i) For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending before July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), shall apply on a pro-rata basis to interest paid to both related and unrelated parties, regardless of whether the related parties are subject to the add-back provision of either subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of this subsection or in section 5 of P.L.2002, c.40 (C.54:10A-4.4). (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on and after July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), shall apply to a combined group as though the combined group filed a federal consolidated return; provided, however, for the purposes of applying the limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), with regard to affiliates that were members of the federal consolidated return but were not members of the combined group included on the New Jersey combined return, the combined group and the affiliates will also be treated as having filed one federal consolidated return. (3)   The director may, whenever necessary to properly reflect the entire net income of any taxpayer, determine the year or period in which any item of income or deduction shall be included, without being limited to the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer. (4)   There shall be allowed as a deduction from entire net income of a banking corporation, to the extent not deductible in determining federal taxable income, the eligible net income of an international banking facility determined as follows: (A)  The eligible net income of an international banking facility shall be the amount remaining after subtracting from the eligible gross income the applicable expenses; (B)  Eligible gross income shall be the gross income derived by an international banking facility, which shall include, but not be limited to, gross income derived from: (i)    Making, arranging for, placing or carrying loans to foreign persons, provided, however, that in the case of a foreign person which is an individual, or which is a foreign branch of a domestic corporation (other than a bank), or which is a foreign corporation or foreign partnership which is controlled by one or more domestic corporations (other than banks), domestic partnerships or resident individuals, all the proceeds of the loan are for use outside of the United States; (ii)   Making or placing deposits with foreign persons which are banks or foreign branches of banks (including foreign subsidiaries) or foreign branches of the taxpayers or with other international banking facilities; (iii)  Entering into foreign exchange trading or hedging transactions related to any of the transactions described in this paragraph; or (iv)  Such other activities as an international banking facility may, from time to time, be authorized to engage in; (C)  Applicable expenses shall be any expense or other deductions attributable, directly or indirectly, to the eligible gross income described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (5)   (A) (i) Entire net income shall exclude 100% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section for privilege periods beginning on or before December 31, 2016. (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and before January 1, 2019, entire net income shall exclude 95% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid, to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. For the purposes of calculating the tax liability owed for the paid or deemed paid dividends included in entire net income by this subsubparagraph (ii), the taxpayer shall use either their three-year average allocation factor for the taxpayer's 2014 through 2016 tax years reported on the taxpayer's tax returns or 3.5 percent, whichever is lower. (iii)  For privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019 and ending before July 31, 2023, entire net income shall exclude 95% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. (iv)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, entire net income shall exclude 100 percent of dividends and deemed dividends that were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80 percent or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. (B)  Entire net income shall exclude 50% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of 50% or more ownership of investment, such ownership of investment calculated in the same manner as the 80% or more of ownership of investment is calculated as described in subsection (d) of this section. (C)  To the extent a subsidiary received dividends from other subsidiaries and included those dividends in its entire net income for the purposes of determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and paid tax on those dividends, the taxpayer receiving those same dividends from the subsidiary shall exclude those dividends from its entire net income based on the subsidiary's allocation factor used by the subsidiary in determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  This subparagraph (C) shall not apply to privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019. (D)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019 but before July 31, 2020, to the extent a subsidiary received dividends from other subsidiaries and included those dividends in its entire net income for the purposes of determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and paid tax on those dividends, the taxpayer receiving those same dividends from the subsidiary shall exclude those dividends from its entire net income. (E)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2020, for purposes of this paragraph (5), the members of a combined group filing a New Jersey combined return shall be treated as one taxpayer with regard to dividends and deemed dividends that were received as part of the unitary business of the combined group. (F)   For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023: (i)    The exclusion provided by this paragraph (5) shall be deducted from entire net income after the State modifications that increase federal entire net income but before the other State modifications that reduce entire net income and before the allocation of entire net income to this State. (ii)   In computing the total amount of the dividends and deemed dividends excluded by this paragraph (5) for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the amount of dividends and deemed dividends excluded shall be reduced by the amount of the expenses and deductions that are attributable to those dividends and deemed dividends. For purposes of this paragraph (5), expenses and deductions related to dividends shall equal five percent of all dividends and deemed dividends received by a taxpayer during an income year. (G)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, for the purposes of this paragraph (5) and for subsection d. of section 18 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.6), the income amounts required to be included in federal taxable income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. s.951A, shall be considered a dividend. (6)   (A) Net operating loss deduction. For privilege periods ending before July 31, 2019, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the privilege period the net operating loss carryover to that period. (B)  Net operating loss carryover. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 1984 shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the seven privilege periods following the period of the loss and a net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 2009 shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the twenty privilege periods following the period of the loss. The entire amount of the net operating loss for any privilege period (the "loss period") shall be carried to the earliest of the privilege periods to which the loss may be carried. The portion of the loss which shall be carried to each of the other privilege periods shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of the loss over the sum of the entire net income, computed without the exclusions permitted in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection or the net operating loss deduction provided by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, for each of the prior privilege periods to which the loss may be carried. (C)  Net operating loss. For purposes of this paragraph the term "net operating loss" means the excess of the deductions over the gross income used in computing entire net income without the net operating loss deduction provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the exclusions in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. (D)  Change in ownership. Where there is a change in 50% or more of the ownership of a corporation because of redemption or sale of stock and the corporation changes the trade or business giving rise to the loss, no net operating loss sustained before the changes may be carried over to be deducted from income earned after such changes. In addition where the facts support the premise that the corporation was acquired under any circumstances for the primary purpose of the use of its net operating loss carryover, the director may disallow the carryover. (E)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (6) of subsection (k) of this section to the contrary, for privilege periods beginning during calendar year 2002 and calendar year 2003, no deduction for any net operating loss carryover shall be allowed and for privilege periods beginning during calendar year 2004 and calendar year 2005, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the privilege period so much of the net operating loss carryover as reduces entire net income otherwise calculated by 50%. If and only to the extent that any net operating loss carryover deduction is disallowed by reason of this subparagraph (E), the date on which the amount of the disallowed net operating loss carryover deduction would otherwise expire shall be extended by a period equal to the period for which application of the net operating loss was disallowed by this subparagraph. Provided, that this subparagraph (E) shall not restrict the surrender or acquisition of corporation business tax benefit certificates pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1997, c.334 (C.34:1B-7.42a) and shall not restrict the application of corporation business tax benefit certificates pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.334 (C.54:10A-4.2). (F)   Reduction for discharge of indebtedness. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 2014, and any net operating loss carryover to such privilege period, shall be reduced by the amount excluded from federal taxable income under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.108), for the privilege period of the discharge of indebtedness. (7)   The entire net income of gas, electric and gas and electric public utilities that were subject to, or would have been subject to tax if doing business in this State, the provisions of P.L.1940, c.5 (C.54:30A-49 et seq.) prior to 1998, shall be adjusted by substituting the New Jersey depreciation allowance for federal tax depreciation with respect to assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998. For gas, electric, and gas and electric public utilities that were subject to, or would have been subject to tax if doing business in this State, the provisions of P.L.1940, c.5 (C.54:30A-49 et seq.) prior to 1998, the New Jersey depreciation allowance shall be computed as follows: All depreciable assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be considered a single asset account. The New Jersey tax basis of this depreciable asset account shall be an amount equal to the carryover adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes on December 31, 1997 of all depreciable assets in service on December 31, 1997, increased by the excess, of the "net carrying value," defined to be adjusted book basis of all assets and liabilities, excluding deferred income taxes, recorded on the public utility's books of account on December 31, 1997, over the carryover adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes on December 31, 1997 of all assets and liabilities owned by the gas, electric, or gas and electric public utility as of December 31, 1997. "Books of account" for gas, gas and electric, and electric public utilities means the uniform system of accounts as promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and adopted by the Board of Public Utilities. The following adjustments to entire net income shall be made pursuant to this section: (A)  Depreciation for property placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be adjusted as follows: (i)    Depreciation for federal income tax purposes shall be disallowed in full. (ii)   A deduction shall be allowed for the New Jersey depreciation allowance. The New Jersey depreciation allowance shall be computed for the single asset account described above based on the New Jersey tax basis as adjusted above as if all assets in the single asset account were first placed in service on January 1, 1998. Depreciation shall be computed using the straight line method over a thirty-year life. A full year's depreciation shall be allowed in the initial tax year. No half-year convention shall apply. The depreciable basis of the single account shall be reduced by the adjusted federal tax basis of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of during any year on which gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes as described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (B)  Gains and losses on sales, retirements and other dispositions of assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be recognized and reported on the same basis as for federal income tax purposes. (C)  The Director of the Division of Taxation shall promulgate regulations describing the methodology for allocating the single asset account in the event that a portion of the utility's operations are separated, spun-off, transferred to a separate company or otherwise desegregated. (8)   In the case of taxpayers that are gas, electric, gas and electric, or telecommunications public utilities as defined pursuant to subsection (q) of this section, the director shall have authority to promulgate rules and issue guidance correcting distortions and adjusting timing differences resulting from the adoption of P.L.1997, c.162 (C.54:10A-5.25 et al.). (9)   Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, entire net income shall not include the income derived by a corporation organized in a foreign country from the international operation of a ship or ships, or from the international operation of aircraft, if such income is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 883 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.883. (10) Entire net income shall exclude all income of an alien corporation the activities of which are limited in this State to investing or trading in stocks and securities for its own account, investing or trading in commodities for its own account, or any combination of those activities, within the meaning of section 864 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.864, as in effect on December 31, 1998. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if an alien corporation undertakes one or more infrequent, extraordinary or non-recurring activities, including but not limited to the sale of tangible property, only the income from such infrequent, extraordinary or non-recurring activity shall be subject to the tax imposed pursuant to P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), and that amount of income subject to tax shall be determined without regard to the allocation to that specific transaction of any general business expense of the taxpayer and shall be specifically assigned to this State for taxation by this State without regard to section 6 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6). For the purposes of this paragraph, "alien corporation" means a corporation organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or its political subdivisions. (11) No deduction shall be allowed for research and experimental expenditures, to the extent that those research and experimental expenditures are qualified research expenses or basic research payments for which an amount of credit is claimed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24) unless those research and experimental expenditures are also used to compute a federal credit claimed pursuant to section 41 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.41; provided, however, for privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2022, a deduction for research and experimental expenditures shall be allowed during the same privilege period for which a credit is claimed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24), notwithstanding the timing schedule required by the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.174, for the deduction of specified research and experimental expenditures. (12) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (k) of section 168 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.168, subsection (b) of section 1400L of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.1400L, or any other federal law, for property acquired after September 10, 2001, the depreciation deduction otherwise allowed pursuant to section 167 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.167, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2001. (B)  The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the acquired property for the purposes of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162. (13) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 179 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.179, for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2004, the costs that a taxpayer may otherwise elect to treat as an expense which is not chargeable to a capital account shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2002. (B)  The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the acquired property for the purposes of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162. (14) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108), for privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2008 and before January 1, 2011, entire net income shall include the amount of discharge of indebtedness income excluded for federal income tax purposes pursuant to subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108), and for privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and before January 1, 2019, entire net income shall exclude the amount of discharge of indebtedness income included for federal income tax purposes, pursuant to subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108). (15) Entire net income shall exclude the gain or income derived from the sale or assignment of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-248) [and], section 10 of P.L.2014, c.63 (C.34:1B-251), or the "New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020," P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.), as amended and supplemented. (16) (A) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in accordance with this paragraph. (B)  For purposes of this paragraph, "net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that exceed the deferred tax assets of the combined group, as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and "net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the deferred tax liabilities of the combined group, as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (C)  Only publicly traded companies, including affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as of the effective date of this paragraph, shall be eligible for this deduction. (D)  If the provisions of sections 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) result in an aggregate increase to the members' net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease to the members' net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the combined group shall be entitled to a deduction, as determined in this paragraph. (E)  (i) Beginning with the combined group's first privilege period on or after January 1 of the fifth year after the effective date of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 et al.), a combined group shall be entitled to a deduction from combined group entire net income equal to one-tenth of the amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, according to the schedule provided by subsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph (E).  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (ii)   For group privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023, but before January 1, 2030, the combined group may deduct one percent of the amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, during a group privilege period.  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (iii)  For group privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2030, the combined group may deduct up to five percent of any remaining unused amount of the deduction during the group privilege period, until the group privilege period in which the total deduction amount has been fully utilized.  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (F)   The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph must be converted to the annual Deferred Tax Deduction amount, as follows: (i)    the deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall be divided by the rate determined under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) at the effective date of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 et al.); (ii)   the resulting amount shall be further divided by the New Jersey unitary business allocation factor that was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph; (iii)  the resulting amount represents the total net Deferred Tax Deduction available over the period as described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. (G)  The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a result of any events happening subsequent to such calculation, including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets. Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than combined group entire net income, any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction to combined group entire net income in future privilege periods until fully utilized. (H)  Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this paragraph shall file a statement with the director on or before July 1 of the year subsequent to the first privilege period for which a combined return is required. Such statement shall specify the total amount of the deduction which the combined group claims on such form and in such manner as prescribed by the director. No deduction shall be allowed under this paragraph for any privilege period except to the extent claimed on such timely filed statement in accordance with this paragraph. (17) (A) In the case of a taxpayer that is a cannabis licensee, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to any expenditure that is eligible to be claimed as a federal income tax deduction but is disallowed because cannabis is a controlled substance under federal law, and income shall be determined without regard to section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.280E) for cannabis licensees. (B)  In the case of a taxpayer that is a cannabis licensee, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to any expenditure that would qualify as a specified research or experimental expenditure pursuant to section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code but is disallowed as a deduction for federal tax purposes because cannabis is a controlled substance under federal law.

"Base year BAF" means the taxpayer's business allocation factor as provided in sections 6 through 10 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10) for purposes of calculating entire net income for the base year, as such section was in effect for the last privilege period ending prior to July 31, 2019. "UNOL" means the unabsorbed portion of net operating loss as calculated under paragraph (6) of subsection (k) of this section as such paragraph was in effect for the last privilege period ending prior to July 31, 2019, that was not deductible in previous privilege periods and was eligible for carryover on the last day of the base year subject to the limitations for deduction under such subsection, including any net operating loss sustained by the taxpayer during the base year.

The value of the UNOL for each privilege period is equal to the product of (I) the amount of the taxpayer's UNOL for a privilege period, and (II) the taxpayer's base year BAF. This result shall equal the taxpayer's prior net operating loss conversion carryover. (B)  The taxpayer shall continue to carry over its prior net operating loss conversion carryover to offset its allocated entire net income as provided in sections 6 through 10 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10) for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019.

(2)   Net operating loss. For purposes of this paragraph the term "net operating loss" means the excess of the deductions over the gross income used in computing entire net income, without regard to any net operating loss carryover, and for privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, computed without the exclusions in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (k) of this section, and for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, computed after the application of paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (k) of this section, allocated to this State pursuant to sections 6 through 10 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10). (3)   Reduction for discharge of indebtedness. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending on or after July 31, 2019, and any net operating loss carryover to such privilege period, shall be reduced by the amount excluded from federal taxable income under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.108, for the privilege period of the discharge of indebtedness.

Where there is a change in 50% or more of the ownership of a corporation because of redemption or sale of stock and the corporation changes the trade or business giving rise to the loss, no net operating loss sustained before the changes may be carried over to be deducted from income earned after such changes. In addition, where the facts support the premise that the corporation was acquired under any circumstances for the primary purpose of the use of its net operating loss carryover, the director may disallow the carryover; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply between members of a combined group reported on a New Jersey combined return.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.96, s.1) 15.  N.J.S.54A:5-1 is amended to read as follows: 54A:5-1.  New Jersey Gross Income Defined.  New Jersey gross income shall consist of the following categories of income: a.     Salaries, wages, tips, fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services rendered whether in cash or in property, and amounts paid or distributed, or deemed paid or distributed, out of a medical savings account that are not excluded from gross income pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1997, c.414 (C.54A:6-27). b.    Net profits from business.  The net income from the operation of a business, profession or other activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes but without deduction of the amount of: (1)   taxes based on income; (2)   a civil, civil administrative, or criminal penalty or fine, including a penalty or fine under an administrative consent order, assessed and collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, an administrative consent order, or an environmental ordinance or resolution of a local governmental entity, and any interest earned on the penalty or fine, and any economic benefits having accrued to the violator as a result of a violation, which benefits are assessed and recovered in a civil, civil administrative, or criminal action, or pursuant to an administrative consent order.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a penalty or fine assessed or collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, or local environmental ordinance or resolution, if the penalty or fine was for a violation that resulted from fire, riot, sabotage, flood, storm event, natural cause, or other act of God beyond the reasonable control of the violator, or caused by an act or omission of a person who was outside the reasonable control of the violator; and (3)   treble damages paid to the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11f) for costs incurred by the department in removing, or arranging for the removal of, an unauthorized discharge upon the failure of the discharger to comply with a directive from the department to remove, or arrange for the removal of, a discharge. c.     Net gains or income from disposition of property.  Net gains or net income, less net losses, derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of property, including real or personal, whether tangible or intangible as determined in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.  For the purpose of determining gain or loss, the basis of property shall be the adjusted basis used for federal income tax purposes, except as expressly provided for under this act, but without a deduction for penalties, fines, or economic benefits excepted pursuant to paragraph (2), or for treble damages excepted pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section. A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director. For the tax year 1976, any taxpayer with a tax liability under this subsection, or under the "Tax on Capital Gains and Other Unearned Income Act," P.L.1975, c.172 (C.54:8B-1 et seq.), shall not be subject to payment of an amount greater than the amount he would have paid if either return had covered all capital transactions during the full tax year 1976; provided, however, that the rate which shall apply to any capital gain shall be that in effect on the date of the transaction.  To the extent that any loss is used to offset any gain under P.L.1975, c.172, it shall not be used to offset any gain under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.

For purposes of this clause, the term "reorganization" means[--]: (i)    A statutory merger or consolidation; (ii)   The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) of stock of another corporation if, immediately after the acquisition, the acquiring corporation has control of such other corporation (whether or not such acquiring corporation had control immediately before the acquisition); (iii) The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of substantially all of the properties of another corporation, but in determining whether the exchange is solely for stock the assumption by the acquiring corporation of a liability of the other, or the fact that property acquired is subject to a liability, shall be disregarded; (iv)  A transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; (v)   A recapitalization; (vi)  A mere change in identity, form, or place of organization however effected; or (vii) The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange for stock of a corporation (referred to in this subclause as "controlling corporation") which is in control of the acquiring corporation, of substantially all of the properties of another corporation which in the transaction is merged into the acquiring corporation shall not disqualify a transaction under subclause (i) if such transaction would have qualified under subclause (i) if the merger had been into the controlling corporation, and no stock of the acquiring corporation is used in the transaction; (viii) A transaction otherwise qualifying under subclause (i) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (referred to in this subclause as the "controlling corporation") which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if after the transaction, the corporation surviving the merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction); and in the transaction, former shareholders of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of the controlling corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving corporation which constitutes control of such corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "a party to a reorganization" includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization, and both corporations, in the case of a reorganization resulting from the acquisition by one corporation of stock or properties of another.  In the case of a reorganization qualifying under subclause (i) by reason of subclause (vii) the term "a party to a reorganization" includes the controlling corporation referred to in such subclause (vii). Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.     Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

STATEMENT This bill amends and supplements the New Jersey Aspire Program Act (Aspire Program) and provides for certain related changes to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax and Corporation Business Tax. Aspire Program Definitions The bill revises the definition of a commercial project to include space that is predominantly used for warehouse distribution or fulfillment centers.  The bill amends the definition of an incentive area to include an endorsed plan and removes certain transportation connectivity requirements that exist under current law. The bill defines a mixed-use project as a redevelopment project including a residential component and a nonresidential component. The bill also clarifies that the definition of the term project cost also applies to the term total project cost.  The definition for total project cost under current law instead applies for the term total development cost or total redevelopment cost under the bill. The bill provides that for a redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality, the following costs are also included in the project cost or total project cost: the costs of land and building acquisition, professional services, environmental remediation, and infrastructure improvements. Aspire Program Changes Concerning Residential Projects The bill provides that the New Jersey Economic Development Authoritys (authority) housing affordability controls are to be consistent with those in the Fair Housing Act, except not including the bedroom distribution requirements for three-bedroom housing units. The bill provides that, in addition to the exemption for certain commercial tenants, commercial subtenants, or other commercial occupants with rights in a redevelopment project, any residential tenant of a redevelopment project is also exempt from the requirement to pay the prevailing wage rate for each workers craft or trade when that worker is employed to perform building services work at the redevelopment project. Sale of Buildings Under the Aspire Program A developer is permitted, under the bill, to sell one or more buildings during the eligibility period if the sale is an arms-length sale and is subject to the purchasers assumption of all obligations under the Aspire Program. Aspire Program Community Benefit Requirement The bill amends current law to exempt the developers of certain projects from the requirements of a community benefits agreement once the host municipality certifies the approval letter or adopts the redevelopment agreement at a public meeting, which documents are required to state that the community benefit under a community benefits agreement has been met. Aspire Program Occupancy Requirement Beginning on the third year following the date of issuance of a final certificate of occupancy during the eligibility period of a commercial project and through the eligibility period, the developer and any co-applicant is required to maintain at least 60 percent occupancy or to forfeit all tax credits for the tax period in which occupancy falls below this minimum requirement.  Tax credits are allowed in full upon restoration of 60 percent or greater occupancy.    Occupancy is to be measured by the average occupancy rate during the relevant tax period.  Residential projects are exempt from this requirement. Eligibility Period Under Aspire Program The bill reduces the maximum duration of an eligibility period for a commercial project, mixed-use project, or residential project to 10 years.  Under current law, the maximum duration of an eligibility period for a commercial or mixed-use project is 15 years, and for a residential project is 10 years.  The bill adds that the authority may determine a shorter eligibility period if this reduction would enhance access to tax credit monetization or otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the program. Total Tax Credit Eligibility Under Aspire Program The bill increases the amount of tax credits that may be awarded to a developer in certain circumstances. Specifically, the bill provides that a developer may be allowed each of the following enhancements to the developers total tax credit award: (1) for a redevelopment project that includes redevelopment of a stranded asset, an increase of up to 10 percent of the project cost.  Under the bill, a stranded asset is defined as any building previously used for commercial, retail, office space, manufacturing, or industrial purposes, which building is no longer used for such purposes, and which has been abandoned, experienced significant vacancies for at least two consecutive years, or has fallen into such disrepair as to be untenantable; (2) for a residential project meeting the three-bedroom distribution requirements of the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls, an increase of up to five percent of the project cost; or (3) for a redevelopment project meeting local first source hiring requirements for the municipality or county where the project is located, an increase of up to three percent of the project cost. However, except for any redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality, the bill limits a developers total tax credits awarded under the Aspire Program, together with any program administered by the authority for a redevelopment project, to: 90 percent of the project cost for redevelopment projects that receive tax credits under the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program; and 80 percent of the project cost for all other redevelopment projects. Aspire Program Tax Credit Carry Forward and Transfer Under current law, a developer is required to apply tax credits during the tax periods approved by the authority.  This bill additionally authorizes a developer to apply tax credits within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer.  Similarly, a developer is authorized under the bill to transfer the tax credits, and a transferee is authorized to use the tax credits, within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer. Transformative Projects Under Aspire Program This bill amends current requirements for certain transformative projects.  Under current law, a residential project with fewer than 700 new residential units is required to include the construction of 50,000 square feet or more of commercial space to qualify as a transformative project.  Under this bill, this requirement is reduced to 20,000 or more of commercial space, which may include retail space. Additionally, the bill permits a parking component to be included in the calculation of the total square footage of a transformative project, but only if constructed in agreement with local zoning, planning, or similar requirements and with the Residential Site Improvement Standards.  Portions of a parking component that exceed local parking requirements or the Residential Site Improvement Standards are not to be included in these calculations.  However, if the project is located within a government restricted municipality, the entire parking component is required to be included in the calculation of square footage requirements for a transformative project, regardless of agreement with local requirements or Residential Site Improvement Standards. Aspire Program Fees The bill requires that the fees charged by the authority under the program be proportional to tax credit amount allowed for a redevelopment project.  The authority is required to promulgate a schedule of fees that are limited to coverage of actual direct costs of administering the program, coverage of reasonable indirect costs of administering the program, and maintenance of reasonable reserves for administering the program. The bill provides that applications submitted prior to the effective date of this bill remain subject to the authoritys fees in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this bill. Applicability to Aspire Program Applications Already Received The bill provides that any application submitted on or after the date six months prior to the bills effective date is subject to the new requirements provided for in the bill, except for the fees imposed on applications that precede the effective date of the bill. Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program Under Aspire Program The bill provides for the establishment of a Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program for the purpose of offering loans or loan guarantees, at the discretion of the authority, to developers whose redevelopment projects have an outstanding financing gap.  The purpose of the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program is to offer additional financing to the developer of a redevelopment project, prior to the issuance of tax credits under the Aspire Program, to ensure the completion of the project. To apply for a loan under the program, the developer is required to submit to the authority a proposed loan and interest amount, a repayment plan, an accounting of the remaining project financing gap, and any other information the authority requires.  To apply for a loan guarantee, the developer is required to submit to the authority a proposed loan guarantee amount and terms, an accounting of the remaining project gap, and any other information the authority requires. The bill authorizes the authority to issue loans and loan guarantees using a Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Revolving Fund, into which all monies received from loan repayments are to be deposited.  All monies received in the fund are to support the program until such time as the authority determines there remains no need for bridge financing, or until December 31, 2028, whichever occurs first, at which point the monies in the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Revolving Fund are to be deposited into the General Fund. The bill requires that the authority recommend to the Governor and the Legislature an amount for appropriation, which amount is necessary for the administration of the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program. Aspire Program Tax Credit Redemption The bill requires the Department of the Treasury to redeem unused tax credits, as the department deems necessary.  The bill authorizes the department to purchase such certificates at a discount of their face value, which discount may not exceed 10 percent.  The tax credit redemptions are to be paid in the same manner as tax refunds, except that the proceeds of the redemption may be issued over one or more tax periods, but not to exceed the eligibility period. Changes to Corporate Business Tax and Gross Income Tax The bill amends current law to exclude gains from the transfer of tax credits issued pursuant to the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 from the calculation of entire net income under the New Jersey Corporate Business Tax and gross income under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax.

and subject to the purchasers assumption of all obligations relating to the buildings pursuant to sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335).  If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive award.  If the authority rescinds an incentive award in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive award, then the authority may assign the incentive award to another applicant.  The incentive award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developer's projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. c.     To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis.  If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive award.  At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developer's rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval.  If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment.  The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period.  Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developer's rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval.  If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds.  If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund. d.    The incentive award agreement shall include a requirement that the authority confirm with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action for the developer, and the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the redevelopment project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The incentive award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive award in any year in which the developer is neither in substantial good standing with each department nor has entered into a practical corrective action.  The incentive award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. e. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the authority shall not enter into an incentive award agreement for a redevelopment project that includes at least one retail establishment which will have more than 10 employees, at least one distribution center which will have more than 20 employees, or at least one hospitality establishment which will have more than 10 employees, unless the incentive award agreement includes a precondition that any business that serves as the owner or operator of the retail establishment, distribution center, or hospitality establishment enters into a labor harmony agreement with a labor organization or cooperating labor organizations which represent retail establishment, hospitality establishment, or distribution center employees in the State. (2) A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into an incentive award agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be able to go forward if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3) (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2023, c.98) f. (1) Except for a residential project that is located in a government-restricted municipality, and in which 100 percent of the residential units constructed in the residential project are reserved for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households, for a redevelopment project whose total project cost equals or exceeds $10 million, in addition to the incentive award agreement, a developer shall enter into a community benefits agreement with the authority and the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located.  The agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for training, employment, and youth development and free services to underserved communities in and around the community in which the redevelopment project is located. Prior to entering a community benefits agreement, the governing body of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located shall hold at least one public hearing at which the governing body shall hear testimony from residents, community groups, and other stakeholders on the needs of the community that the agreement should address. (2) The community benefits agreement shall provide for the creation of a community advisory committee to oversee the implementation of the agreement, monitor successes, ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement, and produce an annual public report.  The community advisory committee created pursuant to this paragraph shall be comprised of representatives of diverse community groups and residents of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located. (3) At the time the developer submits the annual report required pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330) to the authority, the developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that it is in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement.  If the developer fails to provide the certification required pursuant to this paragraph or the authority determines that the developer is not in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement based on the reports submitted by the community advisory committee pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the authority may rescind an award or recapture all or part of any tax credits awarded. (4) Notwithstanding any requirement of this subsection to the contrary, a developer shall be considered to have met the requirements of a community benefits agreement [pursuant to this subsection], and the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection shall not apply, if the developer submits to the authority: (a) a copy of either the developer's approval letter from the authority or a redevelopment agreement applicable to the qualified business facility, provided that the approval letter is certified by the municipality or the redevelopment agreement is [certified] adopted by resolution at a public meeting by the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, and includes provisions that meet [or exceed] the [standards] community benefit required [for] under a community benefits agreement in this subsection [, as determined by the chief executive officer pursuant to rules adopted by the authority]; or (b) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, which resolution shall be adopted after at least one public hearing at which the governing body provides an opportunity for residents, community groups, and other stakeholders to testify, and which resolution shall state that the governing body has determined that the redevelopment project will provide economic and social benefits to the community that fulfill the purposes of this subsection, which benefits render a separate community benefit agreement unnecessary, and explain the reasons supporting the governing body's determination. g.    A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive award agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or other event evidencing project completion that begins the eligibility period indicated in the incentive award agreement.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury.  Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. h.    The incentive award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. i.     The incentive award agreement shall include one or more provisions, as determined by the authority, concerning the terms and conditions for default and the remedies for the developer of a redevelopment project in the event of default.  The incentive award agreement shall not allow the authority to declare a cross-default when the developer of a redevelopment project, including any business affiliate of the developer or any other entity with common principals as the developer, is in default with any other assistance program administered by the authority. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.6) 5.    Section 61 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329) is amended to read as follows: 61.  a. Up to the limits established in subsection b. of this section and in accordance with an incentive award agreement, beginning upon the receipt of occupancy permits for any portion of the redevelopment project, or upon any other event evidencing project completion as set forth in the incentive award agreement, a developer shall be allowed a total tax credit [that shall not exceed] as follows, subject to the enhancements set forth in subsection c. of this section: (1) 80 percent of the total project cost for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (2) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a redevelopment project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (3)   50 percent of the total project cost for any other redevelopment project. b.    The value of all tax credits approved by the authority under the program for a redevelopment project phase shall not exceed: (1)   $120,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (2)   $90,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is allowed a tax credit under paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section; and (3)   $60,000,000 for any other redevelopment project or phase. c.     Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in subsection a. of this section, but subject to the limitations of subsections b. and d. of this section and the demonstration of a financing gap, a developer shall be eligible for each of the following enhancements to the total tax credit award: (1)   for a redevelopment project that includes the redevelopment of a stranded asset, an enhancement of up to 10 percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project; (2)   for a residential project that meets the three-bedroom distribution requirement under the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls, an enhancement of up to five percent of the project cost of the residential project; and (3)   for a redevelopment project that meets local first source hiring requirements for residents in the municipality or county where the project is located, an enhancement of up to three percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project. d.    Except for a redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality: (1)   the total tax credits awarded for the redevelopment project, together with all tax credits awarded under any other program administered by the authority, shall not exceed 80 percent of the project cost of the redevelopment project; and (2)   for a redevelopment project that receives tax credits under the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, the total tax credits awarded for the redevelopment project, together with all tax credits awarded under any other program administered by the authority and under the Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, shall not exceed 90 percent of the project cost. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.7) 6.    Section 62 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330) is amended to read as follows: 62.  a. A developer approved for an incentive award pursuant to sections 58 and 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326 and C.34:1B-327) and that enters an incentive award agreement pursuant to section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328) shall submit annually, commencing in the year in which the incentive award is issued and for the remainder of the eligibility period, a report indicating whether the developer is aware of any condition, event, or act that would cause the developer not to be in compliance with the incentive award agreement or the provisions of sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335) and any additional reporting requirements contained in the incentive award agreement or tax credit certificate.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury. b.    (1) Upon receipt and review of each report submitted during the eligibility period, the authority shall provide to the developer and the director a certificate of compliance indicating the amount of tax credits that the developer may apply against the developer's tax liability. (2)   Upon receipt by the director of the certificate of compliance, the director shall allow the developer a credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  A developer shall apply the credit awarded against the developer's liability under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5 for the privilege period [during] identified in the tax credit certificate which the director [allows] issues to the developer [a tax credit] pursuant to this subsection, or within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer. A developer may carry forward an unused credit resulting from the limitations of paragraph (3) of this subsection, if necessary, for use in the seven privilege periods next following the privilege period for which the credits are [awarded] applied. Credits granted to a partnership shall be passed through to the partners, members, or owners, respectively, pro-rata, or pursuant to an executed agreement among the partners, members, or owners documenting an alternate distribution method provided to the director accompanied by any additional information as the director may prescribe. (3)   The director shall prescribe the order of priority of the application of the credit allowed under this section and any other credits allowed by law against the tax imposed under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  The amount of the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with any other credits allowed by law, shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5). (cf: P.L.2022, c.46, s.1) 7.    Section 63 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-331) is amended to read as follows: 63.  a. A developer may apply to the director and the chief executive officer of the authority for a tax credit transfer certificate, covering one or more years, in lieu of the developer being allowed any amount of the credit against the tax liability of the developer.  The tax credit transfer certificate, upon receipt thereof by the developer from the director and the chief executive officer of the authority, may be sold or assigned, in full or in part in an amount not less than $25,000, in the privilege period during which the developer receives the tax credit transfer certificate from the director, to another person, who may apply the credit against a tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), sections 2 and 3 of P.L.1945, c.132 (C.54:18A-2 and C.54:18A-3), section 1 of P.L.1950, c.231 (C.17:32-15), or N.J.S.17B:23-5.  The certificate provided to the developer shall include a statement waiving the developer's right to claim the amount of the credit that the developer has elected to sell or assign against the developer's tax liability. b.    The developer shall not sell or assign, including a collateral assignment, a tax credit transfer certificate allowed under this section for consideration received by the developer of less than 85 percent of the transferred credit amount before considering any further discounting to present value which shall be permitted, except a developer of a residential project consisting of newly-constructed residential units may assign a tax credit transfer certificate for consideration of less than 85 percent subject to the submission of a plan to the authority and the agency to use the proceeds derived from the assignment of tax credits to complete the residential project, except a developer of a residential project consisting of newly-constructed residential units that has received federal low income housing tax credits under 26 U.S.C. s.42(b)(1)(B)(i) may assign a tax credit transfer certificate for consideration of no less than 65 percent subject to the submission of a plan to the authority and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency to use the proceeds derived from the assignment of tax credits to complete the residential project.  The tax credit transfer certificate issued to a developer by the director shall be subject to any limitations and conditions imposed on the application of State tax credits pursuant to sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through 34:1B-335) and any other terms and conditions that the director may prescribe; provided, however, that the holder of a tax credit certificate may transfer all or part of the tax credit amount, within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer, on or after the date of issuance of the tax credit transfer certificate, for use by the transferee in the tax period for which it was issued or within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit transfer certificate is received by the transferee, and the transferee may carry forward all or part of the tax credit amount in any of the next five successive tax periods after the tax period for which it was used. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the amount of tax credits that may be claimed by the transferee in any tax period shall not exceed the total tax credit amount divided by the duration of the eligibility period in years. c.     A purchaser or assignee of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to this section shall not make any subsequent transfers, assignments, or sales of the tax credit transfer certificate. d.    The authority shall publish on its Internet website the following information concerning each tax credit transfer certificate approved by the authority and the director pursuant to this section: (1) the name of the transferor; (2) the name of the transferee; (3) the value of the tax credit transfer certificate; and (4) the consideration received by the transferor. e.     When a tax credit certificate is issued to a developer after the tax period in which all or part of the tax credits may be used by the developer or a holder of the credit transfer certificate, the developer or transferee shall be allowed to use the tax credit for the same tax period specified in the tax credit certificate, or within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the certificate is received by the developer or transferee.  In this circumstance, the developer or transferee shall not be required to amend its tax return for the tax period in which it applies the tax credit or for a tax period preceding the tax period in which the tax credit is applied. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.8) 8.    Section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333) is amended to read as follows: 65.  a. As used in this section, "transformative project" means a redevelopment project: that has a project financing gap; that has a total project cost of at least $150,000,000; that, subject to the provisions of subsection h. of this section, includes 200,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for a project located in a government-restricted municipality, that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms, or other infrastructure for film production, that includes 300,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for a project located in an enhanced area, or that includes 500,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for any other project; and, for a commercial project, that is of special economic importance as measured by the level of new jobs, new capital investment, opportunities to leverage leadership in a high-priority targeted industry, or other state priorities as determined by the authority pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated to implement this section.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of section 14 of P.L.2023, c.98 (C.34:1B-335.1) to the contrary, for applications submitted on and after the effective date of P.L.2023, c.98 (C.34:1B-335.1 et al.), if the redevelopment project is located entirely on land designated by the Department of Environmental Protection as a brownfield development area pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2005, c.223 (C.58:10B-25.1), and the project cost of the redevelopment project includes at least $15,000,000 in environmental remediation costs, the redevelopment project shall constitute a project of special economic importance.  A transformative project may be completed in phases, which phases may be determined by the authority based on factors such as written architectural plans and specifications completed before or during the physical work, certificates of occupancy, or financial and operational plans.  The criteria developed by the authority shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1)   the extent to which the proposed transformative project would create modern facilities that enhance the State's competitiveness in attracting targeted industries; (2)   (a) for a residential project, the construction of 700 or more new residential units; (b)   for a residential project containing [less] fewer than 700 new residential units, the construction of 200 or more new residential units if the project is located in a government-restricted municipality, 300 or more residential units if the project is located in an enhanced area, or 400 or more residential units for all other mixed-use projects; (c)   for a residential project containing [less] fewer than 700 new residential units, the construction of [50,000] 20,000 square feet or more of commercial space, which commercial space may include retail space; and (d)   for a residential project, 20 percent of the new residential units shall be constructed for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households with affordability controls as adopted by the authority, in consultation with the agency, in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 56 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-324), except that a residential project receiving a federal historic rehabilitation tax credit pursuant to section 47 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.47, or a tax credit pursuant to the "Historic Property Reinvestment Act," sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through 34:1B-276), shall be exempt from the affordability controls related to bedroom distribution; and (3)   the extent to which the proposed project would leverage the competitive economic development advantages of the State's mass transit assets, higher education assets, and other economic development assets in attracting or retaining both employers and skilled workers generally or in targeted industries. A    "transformative project" shall not include a redevelopment project at which more than 50 percent of the premises is occupied by one or more businesses engaged in final point of sale retail. b.    (1) The authority may award incentive awards to transformative projects in accordance with the provisions of sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335). (2)   (a) For transformative projects completed in phases, the developer shall enter into a transformative phase agreement with the authority. (b)   As used in this subsection, "transformative phase agreement" shall mean a sub-agreement of the incentive award agreement that governs the timing, capital investment, and other applicable details of the respective phase of a phased project. (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 57 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-325), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, a transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued a certificate of occupancy for the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within five years of executing the incentive award agreement, except that the authority may, in its discretion, extend this deadline by up to one additional year.  For transformative projects completed in phases, the transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued certificates of occupancy for all phases of the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within 10 years of executing either the incentive award agreement or the first transformative phase agreement corresponding to the transformative project. (4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 55 and 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 and C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, each phase of a transformative project completed in phases shall have a separate eligibility period.  After completing each phase, the developer shall submit a certification that the phase is completed.  If the authority approves the certification, the tax credit allowed to the developer shall be increased by the tax credit amount corresponding to that phase. Notwithstanding the different eligibility periods for each phase, all conditions and requirements applicable during an eligibility period pursuant to sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335) shall apply to the entire transformative project until the end of the eligibility period for the last phase. (5)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, for a transformative project completed in phases, a review of the project financing gap shall be performed at the certification of completion of each phase, and the authority shall re-evaluate the developer's rate of return in the seventh year and at the end of the eligibility period for the last phase, provided that the authority may also re-evaluate the developer's rate of return during the fifth year of any earlier phase. (6)   A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section, other than a project that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production, shall be located in an incentive area, a distressed municipality, a government-restricted municipality, or an enhanced area.  A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production may be located anywhere in the State.  The authority shall not consider an application for a transformative project unless the applicant submits with its application a letter evidencing support for the transformative project from the governing body of the municipality in which the transformative project is located. c.     The authority shall review the transformative project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  In determining whether a transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developer's State or local tax liability.  The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state.  The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant.  A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer's application for an incentive award that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary.  The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed transformative project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. Projects that are predominantly residential shall be excluded from the calculation of the net benefit test required pursuant to this subsection. d.    In determining net benefits for any business or person considering locating in a transformative project and applying to receive from the authority any other economic development incentive subsequent to the award of transformative project tax credits pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333), the authority shall not credit the business or person with any benefit that was previously credited to the transformative project pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333). e.     The authority shall administer the credits awarded pursuant to this section in accordance with the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330 and C.34:1B-331). f.     Prior to allocating an incentive award to a developer, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan, and the developer shall certify that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the transformative project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. g.    Notwithstanding the limitation on incentive awards set forth in subsection b. of section 61 and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329 and C.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may allow a developer of a transformative project a tax credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1)   (a) 80 percent of the total project cost for a transformative project that is located in a government-restricted municipality; (b)   60 percent of the total project cost for a residential transformative project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (c)   50 percent of the total project cost for any other transformative project; (2)   the total value of the project financing gap; or (3)   $400,000,000, except that for a transformative project that is developed in phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the transformative project. h.    (1) The parking component of a transformative project shall be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project, provided that the parking component shall be constructed in conformity with local zoning, planning, or similar requirements and up to the amount required by the Residential Site Improvement Standards.  Any portion of the parking component that exceeds the local parking requirements or the Residential Site Improvement Standards shall not be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project. (2)   Notwithstanding any provision of paragraph (1) of this subsection to the contrary, the entire parking component of a project located in a government restricted municipality shall be included in the calculation of the total square footage of the project.

With respect to privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, a deduction shall also be permitted if the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing evidence, as determined by the director, that the disallowance of a deduction is unreasonable, or the taxpayer and the director agree in writing to the application or use of an alternative method of apportionment under section 8 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-8); nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit or negate the director's authority to otherwise enter into agreements and compromises otherwise allowed by law. With respect to privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, a deduction shall also be permitted to the extent that the taxpayer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence, as determined by the director, that the interest is directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred to (i) a related member in a foreign nation which has in force a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States and the related member (aa) was subject to tax in the foreign nation on a tax base that included the payment paid, accrued, or incurred; and (bb) under which the related member's income received from the transaction was taxed at an effective tax rate equal to or greater than a rate of three percentage points less than the rate of tax applied to taxable interest by the State of New Jersey pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), provided however that the taxpayer shall disclose on its return for the privilege period the name of the related member, the amount of the interest, the relevant foreign nation, and such other information as the director may prescribe or (ii) to an independent lender and the taxpayer guarantees the debt on which the interest is required. The adjustments required by this subparagraph shall not apply to transactions between related members included in a combined group reported on a New Jersey combined return. (J)   (i) Amounts deducted for federal tax purposes pursuant to section 199 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.199, except that this exclusion shall not apply to amounts deducted pursuant to that section that are exclusively based upon domestic production gross receipts of the taxpayer which are derived only from any lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of qualifying production property which the taxpayer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director was manufactured or produced by the taxpayer in whole or in significant part within the United States but not qualified production property that was grown or extracted by the taxpayer. "Manufactured or produced" as used in this paragraph shall be limited to performance of an operation or series of operations the object of which is to place items of tangible personal property in a form, composition, or character different from that in which they were acquired. The change in form, composition, or character shall be a substantial change, and result in a transformation of property into a different or substantially more usable product. (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017, notwithstanding the provisions of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) or any other law to the contrary, for the purposes of determining the amount of income pursuant to P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) that is net of expenses, no amounts shall be taken as a deduction pursuant to section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.199A). (K)  (i) For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending before July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), shall apply on a pro-rata basis to interest paid to both related and unrelated parties, regardless of whether the related parties are subject to the add-back provision of either subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of this subsection or in section 5 of P.L.2002, c.40 (C.54:10A-4.4). (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2017 and ending on and after July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), shall apply to a combined group as though the combined group filed a federal consolidated return; provided, however, for the purposes of applying the limitation in subsection (j) of section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.163), with regard to affiliates that were members of the federal consolidated return but were not members of the combined group included on the New Jersey combined return, the combined group and the affiliates will also be treated as having filed one federal consolidated return. (3)   The director may, whenever necessary to properly reflect the entire net income of any taxpayer, determine the year or period in which any item of income or deduction shall be included, without being limited to the method of accounting employed by the taxpayer. (4)   There shall be allowed as a deduction from entire net income of a banking corporation, to the extent not deductible in determining federal taxable income, the eligible net income of an international banking facility determined as follows: (A)  The eligible net income of an international banking facility shall be the amount remaining after subtracting from the eligible gross income the applicable expenses; (B)  Eligible gross income shall be the gross income derived by an international banking facility, which shall include, but not be limited to, gross income derived from: (i)    Making, arranging for, placing or carrying loans to foreign persons, provided, however, that in the case of a foreign person which is an individual, or which is a foreign branch of a domestic corporation (other than a bank), or which is a foreign corporation or foreign partnership which is controlled by one or more domestic corporations (other than banks), domestic partnerships or resident individuals, all the proceeds of the loan are for use outside of the United States; (ii)   Making or placing deposits with foreign persons which are banks or foreign branches of banks (including foreign subsidiaries) or foreign branches of the taxpayers or with other international banking facilities; (iii)  Entering into foreign exchange trading or hedging transactions related to any of the transactions described in this paragraph; or (iv)  Such other activities as an international banking facility may, from time to time, be authorized to engage in; (C)  Applicable expenses shall be any expense or other deductions attributable, directly or indirectly, to the eligible gross income described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (5)   (A) (i) Entire net income shall exclude 100% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section for privilege periods beginning on or before December 31, 2016. (ii)   For privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2016 and before January 1, 2019, entire net income shall exclude 95% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid, to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. For the purposes of calculating the tax liability owed for the paid or deemed paid dividends included in entire net income by this subsubparagraph (ii), the taxpayer shall use either their three-year average allocation factor for the taxpayer's 2014 through 2016 tax years reported on the taxpayer's tax returns or 3.5 percent, whichever is lower. (iii)  For privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019 and ending before July 31, 2023, entire net income shall exclude 95% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80% or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. (iv)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, entire net income shall exclude 100 percent of dividends and deemed dividends that were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of the 80 percent or more ownership of investment described in subsection (d) of this section. (B)  Entire net income shall exclude 50% of dividends which were included in computing such taxable income for federal income tax purposes, paid or deemed paid to the taxpayer by one or more subsidiaries owned by the taxpayer to the extent of 50% or more ownership of investment, such ownership of investment calculated in the same manner as the 80% or more of ownership of investment is calculated as described in subsection (d) of this section. (C)  To the extent a subsidiary received dividends from other subsidiaries and included those dividends in its entire net income for the purposes of determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and paid tax on those dividends, the taxpayer receiving those same dividends from the subsidiary shall exclude those dividends from its entire net income based on the subsidiary's allocation factor used by the subsidiary in determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  This subparagraph (C) shall not apply to privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019. (D)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019 but before July 31, 2020, to the extent a subsidiary received dividends from other subsidiaries and included those dividends in its entire net income for the purposes of determining its tax liability pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) and paid tax on those dividends, the taxpayer receiving those same dividends from the subsidiary shall exclude those dividends from its entire net income. (E)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2020, for purposes of this paragraph (5), the members of a combined group filing a New Jersey combined return shall be treated as one taxpayer with regard to dividends and deemed dividends that were received as part of the unitary business of the combined group. (F)   For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023: (i)    The exclusion provided by this paragraph (5) shall be deducted from entire net income after the State modifications that increase federal entire net income but before the other State modifications that reduce entire net income and before the allocation of entire net income to this State. (ii)   In computing the total amount of the dividends and deemed dividends excluded by this paragraph (5) for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the amount of dividends and deemed dividends excluded shall be reduced by the amount of the expenses and deductions that are attributable to those dividends and deemed dividends. For purposes of this paragraph (5), expenses and deductions related to dividends shall equal five percent of all dividends and deemed dividends received by a taxpayer during an income year. (G)  For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, for the purposes of this paragraph (5) and for subsection d. of section 18 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.6), the income amounts required to be included in federal taxable income pursuant to 26 U.S.C. s.951A, shall be considered a dividend. (6)   (A) Net operating loss deduction. For privilege periods ending before July 31, 2019, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the privilege period the net operating loss carryover to that period. (B)  Net operating loss carryover. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 1984 shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the seven privilege periods following the period of the loss and a net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 2009 shall be a net operating loss carryover to each of the twenty privilege periods following the period of the loss. The entire amount of the net operating loss for any privilege period (the "loss period") shall be carried to the earliest of the privilege periods to which the loss may be carried. The portion of the loss which shall be carried to each of the other privilege periods shall be the excess, if any, of the amount of the loss over the sum of the entire net income, computed without the exclusions permitted in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection or the net operating loss deduction provided by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, for each of the prior privilege periods to which the loss may be carried. (C)  Net operating loss. For purposes of this paragraph the term "net operating loss" means the excess of the deductions over the gross income used in computing entire net income without the net operating loss deduction provided for in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and the exclusions in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection. (D)  Change in ownership. Where there is a change in 50% or more of the ownership of a corporation because of redemption or sale of stock and the corporation changes the trade or business giving rise to the loss, no net operating loss sustained before the changes may be carried over to be deducted from income earned after such changes. In addition where the facts support the premise that the corporation was acquired under any circumstances for the primary purpose of the use of its net operating loss carryover, the director may disallow the carryover. (E)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (6) of subsection (k) of this section to the contrary, for privilege periods beginning during calendar year 2002 and calendar year 2003, no deduction for any net operating loss carryover shall be allowed and for privilege periods beginning during calendar year 2004 and calendar year 2005, there shall be allowed as a deduction for the privilege period so much of the net operating loss carryover as reduces entire net income otherwise calculated by 50%. If and only to the extent that any net operating loss carryover deduction is disallowed by reason of this subparagraph (E), the date on which the amount of the disallowed net operating loss carryover deduction would otherwise expire shall be extended by a period equal to the period for which application of the net operating loss was disallowed by this subparagraph. Provided, that this subparagraph (E) shall not restrict the surrender or acquisition of corporation business tax benefit certificates pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1997, c.334 (C.34:1B-7.42a) and shall not restrict the application of corporation business tax benefit certificates pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.334 (C.54:10A-4.2). (F)   Reduction for discharge of indebtedness. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending after June 30, 2014, and any net operating loss carryover to such privilege period, shall be reduced by the amount excluded from federal taxable income under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.108), for the privilege period of the discharge of indebtedness. (7)   The entire net income of gas, electric and gas and electric public utilities that were subject to, or would have been subject to tax if doing business in this State, the provisions of P.L.1940, c.5 (C.54:30A-49 et seq.) prior to 1998, shall be adjusted by substituting the New Jersey depreciation allowance for federal tax depreciation with respect to assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998. For gas, electric, and gas and electric public utilities that were subject to, or would have been subject to tax if doing business in this State, the provisions of P.L.1940, c.5 (C.54:30A-49 et seq.) prior to 1998, the New Jersey depreciation allowance shall be computed as follows: All depreciable assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be considered a single asset account. The New Jersey tax basis of this depreciable asset account shall be an amount equal to the carryover adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes on December 31, 1997 of all depreciable assets in service on December 31, 1997, increased by the excess, of the "net carrying value," defined to be adjusted book basis of all assets and liabilities, excluding deferred income taxes, recorded on the public utility's books of account on December 31, 1997, over the carryover adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes on December 31, 1997 of all assets and liabilities owned by the gas, electric, or gas and electric public utility as of December 31, 1997. "Books of account" for gas, gas and electric, and electric public utilities means the uniform system of accounts as promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and adopted by the Board of Public Utilities. The following adjustments to entire net income shall be made pursuant to this section: (A)  Depreciation for property placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be adjusted as follows: (i)    Depreciation for federal income tax purposes shall be disallowed in full. (ii)   A deduction shall be allowed for the New Jersey depreciation allowance. The New Jersey depreciation allowance shall be computed for the single asset account described above based on the New Jersey tax basis as adjusted above as if all assets in the single asset account were first placed in service on January 1, 1998. Depreciation shall be computed using the straight line method over a thirty-year life. A full year's depreciation shall be allowed in the initial tax year. No half-year convention shall apply. The depreciable basis of the single account shall be reduced by the adjusted federal tax basis of assets sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of during any year on which gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes as described in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph. (B)  Gains and losses on sales, retirements and other dispositions of assets placed in service prior to January 1, 1998 shall be recognized and reported on the same basis as for federal income tax purposes. (C)  The Director of the Division of Taxation shall promulgate regulations describing the methodology for allocating the single asset account in the event that a portion of the utility's operations are separated, spun-off, transferred to a separate company or otherwise desegregated. (8)   In the case of taxpayers that are gas, electric, gas and electric, or telecommunications public utilities as defined pursuant to subsection (q) of this section, the director shall have authority to promulgate rules and issue guidance correcting distortions and adjusting timing differences resulting from the adoption of P.L.1997, c.162 (C.54:10A-5.25 et al.). (9)   Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, entire net income shall not include the income derived by a corporation organized in a foreign country from the international operation of a ship or ships, or from the international operation of aircraft, if such income is exempt from federal taxation pursuant to section 883 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.883. (10) Entire net income shall exclude all income of an alien corporation the activities of which are limited in this State to investing or trading in stocks and securities for its own account, investing or trading in commodities for its own account, or any combination of those activities, within the meaning of section 864 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.864, as in effect on December 31, 1998. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if an alien corporation undertakes one or more infrequent, extraordinary or non-recurring activities, including but not limited to the sale of tangible property, only the income from such infrequent, extraordinary or non-recurring activity shall be subject to the tax imposed pursuant to P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.), and that amount of income subject to tax shall be determined without regard to the allocation to that specific transaction of any general business expense of the taxpayer and shall be specifically assigned to this State for taxation by this State without regard to section 6 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6). For the purposes of this paragraph, "alien corporation" means a corporation organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or its political subdivisions. (11) No deduction shall be allowed for research and experimental expenditures, to the extent that those research and experimental expenditures are qualified research expenses or basic research payments for which an amount of credit is claimed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24) unless those research and experimental expenditures are also used to compute a federal credit claimed pursuant to section 41 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.41; provided, however, for privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2022, a deduction for research and experimental expenditures shall be allowed during the same privilege period for which a credit is claimed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24), notwithstanding the timing schedule required by the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.174, for the deduction of specified research and experimental expenditures. (12) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (k) of section 168 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.168, subsection (b) of section 1400L of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.1400L, or any other federal law, for property acquired after September 10, 2001, the depreciation deduction otherwise allowed pursuant to section 167 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.167, shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2001. (B)  The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the acquired property for the purposes of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162. (13) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 179 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.179, for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2004, the costs that a taxpayer may otherwise elect to treat as an expense which is not chargeable to a capital account shall be determined pursuant to the provisions of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.1 et seq.) in effect on December 31, 2002. (B)  The director shall prescribe the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this paragraph, including, among others, those for determining the adjusted basis of the acquired property for the purposes of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162. (14) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108), for privilege periods beginning after December 31, 2008 and before January 1, 2011, entire net income shall include the amount of discharge of indebtedness income excluded for federal income tax purposes pursuant to subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108), and for privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 and before January 1, 2019, entire net income shall exclude the amount of discharge of indebtedness income included for federal income tax purposes, pursuant to subsection (i) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. s.108). (15) Entire net income shall exclude the gain or income derived from the sale or assignment of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-248) [and], section 10 of P.L.2014, c.63 (C.34:1B-251), or the "New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020," P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.), as amended and supplemented. (16) (A) There shall be allowed as a deduction an amount computed in accordance with this paragraph. (B)  For purposes of this paragraph, "net deferred tax liability" means deferred tax liabilities that exceed the deferred tax assets of the combined group, as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and "net deferred tax asset" means that deferred tax assets exceed the deferred tax liabilities of the combined group, as computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (C)  Only publicly traded companies, including affiliated corporations participating in the filing of a publicly traded company's financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as of the effective date of this paragraph, shall be eligible for this deduction. (D)  If the provisions of sections 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) result in an aggregate increase to the members' net deferred tax liability or an aggregate decrease to the members' net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, the combined group shall be entitled to a deduction, as determined in this paragraph. (E)  (i) Beginning with the combined group's first privilege period on or after January 1 of the fifth year after the effective date of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 et al.), a combined group shall be entitled to a deduction from combined group entire net income equal to one-tenth of the amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, according to the schedule provided by subsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph (E).  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (ii)   For group privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2023, but before January 1, 2030, the combined group may deduct one percent of the amount necessary to offset the increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset, or aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability, during a group privilege period.  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (iii)  For group privilege periods beginning on and after January 1, 2030, the combined group may deduct up to five percent of any remaining unused amount of the deduction during the group privilege period, until the group privilege period in which the total deduction amount has been fully utilized.  Such increase in the net deferred tax liability or decrease in the net deferred tax asset or the aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability shall be computed based on the change that would result from the imposition of the unitary reporting requirements under sections 1 and 18 through 23 of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 and C.54:10A-4.6 to C.54:10A-4.11) but for the deduction provided under this paragraph as of the effective date of this paragraph. (F)   The deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph must be converted to the annual Deferred Tax Deduction amount, as follows: (i)    the deferred tax impact determined in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph shall be divided by the rate determined under section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) at the effective date of P.L.2018, c.48 (C.54:10A-5.41 et al.); (ii)   the resulting amount shall be further divided by the New Jersey unitary business allocation factor that was used by the combined group in the calculation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph; (iii)  the resulting amount represents the total net Deferred Tax Deduction available over the period as described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph. (G)  The deduction calculated under this paragraph shall not be adjusted as a result of any events happening subsequent to such calculation, including, but not limited to, any disposition or abandonment of assets. Such deduction shall be calculated without regard to the federal tax effect and shall not alter the tax basis of any asset. If the deduction under this section is greater than combined group entire net income, any excess deduction shall be carried forward and applied as a deduction to combined group entire net income in future privilege periods until fully utilized. (H)  Any combined group intending to claim a deduction under this paragraph shall file a statement with the director on or before July 1 of the year subsequent to the first privilege period for which a combined return is required. Such statement shall specify the total amount of the deduction which the combined group claims on such form and in such manner as prescribed by the director. No deduction shall be allowed under this paragraph for any privilege period except to the extent claimed on such timely filed statement in accordance with this paragraph. (17) (A) In the case of a taxpayer that is a cannabis licensee, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to any expenditure that is eligible to be claimed as a federal income tax deduction but is disallowed because cannabis is a controlled substance under federal law, and income shall be determined without regard to section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. s.280E) for cannabis licensees. (B)  In the case of a taxpayer that is a cannabis licensee, there shall be allowed as a deduction an amount equal to any expenditure that would qualify as a specified research or experimental expenditure pursuant to section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code but is disallowed as a deduction for federal tax purposes because cannabis is a controlled substance under federal law. Any expenditure that is claimed as a deduction pursuant to this subparagraph may also be claimed as a qualified research expense for purposes of the credit allowed pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.175 (C.54:10A-5.24).

"Base year BAF" means the taxpayer's business allocation factor as provided in sections 6 through 10 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10) for purposes of calculating entire net income for the base year, as such section was in effect for the last privilege period ending prior to July 31, 2019. "UNOL" means the unabsorbed portion of net operating loss as calculated under paragraph (6) of subsection (k) of this section as such paragraph was in effect for the last privilege period ending prior to July 31, 2019, that was not deductible in previous privilege periods and was eligible for carryover on the last day of the base year subject to the limitations for deduction under such subsection, including any net operating loss sustained by the taxpayer during the base year.

For purposes of this paragraph the term "net operating loss" means the excess of the deductions over the gross income used in computing entire net income, without regard to any net operating loss carryover, and for privilege periods ending before July 31, 2023, computed without the exclusions in paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (k) of this section, and for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, computed after the application of paragraphs (4) and (5) of subsection (k) of this section, allocated to this State pursuant to sections 6 through 10 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10). (3)   Reduction for discharge of indebtedness. A net operating loss for any privilege period ending on or after July 31, 2019, and any net operating loss carryover to such privilege period, shall be reduced by the amount excluded from federal taxable income under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 108 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. s.108, for the privilege period of the discharge of indebtedness.

Where there is a change in 50% or more of the ownership of a corporation because of redemption or sale of stock and the corporation changes the trade or business giving rise to the loss, no net operating loss sustained before the changes may be carried over to be deducted from income earned after such changes. In addition, where the facts support the premise that the corporation was acquired under any circumstances for the primary purpose of the use of its net operating loss carryover, the director may disallow the carryover; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply between members of a combined group reported on a New Jersey combined return.

(cf: P.L.2023, c.96, s.1) 15.  N.J.S.54A:5-1 is amended to read as follows: 54A:5-1.  New Jersey Gross Income Defined.  New Jersey gross income shall consist of the following categories of income: a.     Salaries, wages, tips, fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services rendered whether in cash or in property, and amounts paid or distributed, or deemed paid or distributed, out of a medical savings account that are not excluded from gross income pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1997, c.414 (C.54A:6-27). b.    Net profits from business.  The net income from the operation of a business, profession or other activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes but without deduction of the amount of: (1)   taxes based on income; (2)   a civil, civil administrative, or criminal penalty or fine, including a penalty or fine under an administrative consent order, assessed and collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, an administrative consent order, or an environmental ordinance or resolution of a local governmental entity, and any interest earned on the penalty or fine, and any economic benefits having accrued to the violator as a result of a violation, which benefits are assessed and recovered in a civil, civil administrative, or criminal action, or pursuant to an administrative consent order.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a penalty or fine assessed or collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, or local environmental ordinance or resolution, if the penalty or fine was for a violation that resulted from fire, riot, sabotage, flood, storm event, natural cause, or other act of God beyond the reasonable control of the violator, or caused by an act or omission of a person who was outside the reasonable control of the violator; and (3)   treble damages paid to the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11f) for costs incurred by the department in removing, or arranging for the removal of, an unauthorized discharge upon the failure of the discharger to comply with a directive from the department to remove, or arrange for the removal of, a discharge. c.     Net gains or income from disposition of property.  Net gains or net income, less net losses, derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of property, including real or personal, whether tangible or intangible as determined in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.  For the purpose of determining gain or loss, the basis of property shall be the adjusted basis used for federal income tax purposes, except as expressly provided for under this act, but without a deduction for penalties, fines, or economic benefits excepted pursuant to paragraph (2), or for treble damages excepted pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section. A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director. For the tax year 1976, any taxpayer with a tax liability under this subsection, or under the "Tax on Capital Gains and Other Unearned Income Act," P.L.1975, c.172 (C.54:8B-1 et seq.), shall not be subject to payment of an amount greater than the amount he would have paid if either return had covered all capital transactions during the full tax year 1976; provided, however, that the rate which shall apply to any capital gain shall be that in effect on the date of the transaction.  To the extent that any loss is used to offset any gain under P.L.1975, c.172, it shall not be used to offset any gain under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. The term "net gains or income" shall not include gains or income derived from obligations which are referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14 of this act or from securities which evidence ownership in a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1).  The term "net gains or income" shall not include gains or income derived from the sale or assignment of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-248) [and], section 10 of P.L.2014, c.63 (C.34:1B-251), or the "New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020," P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.), as amended and supplemented, from any sale or assignment of a tax credit issued pursuant to an award of tax credits approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority [prior to July 1, 2018], regardless of when such sale or assignment occurs.  The term "net gains or net income" shall not include gains or income from transactions to the extent to which nonrecognition is allowed for federal income tax purposes.  The term "sale, exchange or other disposition" shall not include the exchange of stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization and the transfer of property to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation if immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control of the corporation.  For purposes of this clause, stock or securities issued for services shall not be considered as issued in return for property. For purposes of this clause, the term "reorganization" means[--]: (i)    A statutory merger or consolidation; (ii)   The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation) of stock of another corporation if, immediately after the acquisition, the acquiring corporation has control of such other corporation (whether or not such acquiring corporation had control immediately before the acquisition); (iii) The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange solely for all or part of its voting stock (or in exchange solely for all or a part of the voting stock of a corporation which is in control of the acquiring corporation), of substantially all of the properties of another corporation, but in determining whether the exchange is solely for stock the assumption by the acquiring corporation of a liability of the other, or the fact that property acquired is subject to a liability, shall be disregarded; (iv)  A transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor, or one or more of its shareholders (including persons who were shareholders immediately before the transfer), or any combination thereof, is in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred; (v)   A recapitalization; (vi)  A mere change in identity, form, or place of organization however effected; or (vii) The acquisition by one corporation, in exchange for stock of a corporation (referred to in this subclause as "controlling corporation") which is in control of the acquiring corporation, of substantially all of the properties of another corporation which in the transaction is merged into the acquiring corporation shall not disqualify a transaction under subclause (i) if such transaction would have qualified under subclause (i) if the merger had been into the controlling corporation, and no stock of the acquiring corporation is used in the transaction; (viii) A transaction otherwise qualifying under subclause (i) shall not be disqualified by reason of the fact that stock of a corporation (referred to in this subclause as the "controlling corporation") which before the merger was in control of the merged corporation is used in the transaction, if after the transaction, the corporation surviving the merger holds substantially all of its properties and of the properties of the merged corporation (other than stock of the controlling corporation distributed in the transaction); and in the transaction, former shareholders of the surviving corporation exchanged, for an amount of voting stock of the controlling corporation, an amount of stock in the surviving corporation which constitutes control of such corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation. For purposes of this clause, the term "a party to a reorganization" includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization, and both corporations, in the case of a reorganization resulting from the acquisition by one corporation of stock or properties of another.  In the case of a reorganization qualifying under subclause (i) by reason of subclause (vii) the term "a party to a reorganization" includes the controlling corporation referred to in such subclause (vii). Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.     Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

STATEMENT This bill amends and supplements the New Jersey Aspire Program Act (Aspire Program) and provides for certain related changes to the New Jersey Gross Income Tax and Corporation Business Tax. Aspire Program Definitions The bill revises the definition of a commercial project to include space that is predominantly used for warehouse distribution or fulfillment centers.  The bill amends the definition of an incentive area to include an endorsed plan and removes certain transportation connectivity requirements that exist under current law. The bill defines a mixed-use project as a redevelopment project including a residential component and a nonresidential component. The bill also clarifies that the definition of the term project cost also applies to the term total project cost.  The definition for total project cost under current law instead applies for the term total development cost or total redevelopment cost under the bill. The bill provides that for a redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality, the following costs are also included in the project cost or total project cost: the costs of land and building acquisition, professional services, environmental remediation, and infrastructure improvements. Aspire Program Changes Concerning Residential Projects The bill provides that the New Jersey Economic Development Authoritys (authority) housing affordability controls are to be consistent with those in the Fair Housing Act, except not including the bedroom distribution requirements for three-bedroom housing units. The bill provides that, in addition to the exemption for certain commercial tenants, commercial subtenants, or other commercial occupants with rights in a redevelopment project, any residential tenant of a redevelopment project is also exempt from the requirement to pay the prevailing wage rate for each workers craft or trade when that worker is employed to perform building services work at the redevelopment project. Sale of Buildings Under the Aspire Program A developer is permitted, under the bill, to sell one or more buildings during the eligibility period if the sale is an arms-length sale and is subject to the purchasers assumption of all obligations under the Aspire Program. Aspire Program Community Benefit Requirement The bill amends current law to exempt the developers of certain projects from the requirements of a community benefits agreement once the host municipality certifies the approval letter or adopts the redevelopment agreement at a public meeting, which documents are required to state that the community benefit under a community benefits agreement has been met. Aspire Program Occupancy Requirement Beginning on the third year following the date of issuance of a final certificate of occupancy during the eligibility period of a commercial project and through the eligibility period, the developer and any co-applicant is required to maintain at least 60 percent occupancy or to forfeit all tax credits for the tax period in which occupancy falls below this minimum requirement.  Tax credits are allowed in full upon restoration of 60 percent or greater occupancy.    Occupancy is to be measured by the average occupancy rate during the relevant tax period.  Residential projects are exempt from this requirement. Eligibility Period Under Aspire Program The bill reduces the maximum duration of an eligibility period for a commercial project, mixed-use project, or residential project to 10 years.  Under current law, the maximum duration of an eligibility period for a commercial or mixed-use project is 15 years, and for a residential project is 10 years.  The bill adds that the authority may determine a shorter eligibility period if this reduction would enhance access to tax credit monetization or otherwise enhance the effectiveness of the program. Total Tax Credit Eligibility Under Aspire Program The bill increases the amount of tax credits that may be awarded to a developer in certain circumstances. Specifically, the bill provides that a developer may be allowed each of the following enhancements to the developers total tax credit award: (1) for a redevelopment project that includes redevelopment of a stranded asset, an increase of up to 10 percent of the project cost.  Under the bill, a stranded asset is defined as any building previously used for commercial, retail, office space, manufacturing, or industrial purposes, which building is no longer used for such purposes, and which has been abandoned, experienced significant vacancies for at least two consecutive years, or has fallen into such disrepair as to be untenantable; (2) for a residential project meeting the three-bedroom distribution requirements of the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls, an increase of up to five percent of the project cost; or (3) for a redevelopment project meeting local first source hiring requirements for the municipality or county where the project is located, an increase of up to three percent of the project cost. However, except for any redevelopment project that is located in a government restricted municipality, the bill limits a developers total tax credits awarded under the Aspire Program, together with any program administered by the authority for a redevelopment project, to: 90 percent of the project cost for redevelopment projects that receive tax credits under the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program; and 80 percent of the project cost for all other redevelopment projects. Aspire Program Tax Credit Carry Forward and Transfer Under current law, a developer is required to apply tax credits during the tax periods approved by the authority.  This bill additionally authorizes a developer to apply tax credits within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer.  Similarly, a developer is authorized under the bill to transfer the tax credits, and a transferee is authorized to use the tax credits, within the three successive tax periods immediately following the tax period in which the tax credit certificate is received by the developer. Transformative Projects Under Aspire Program This bill amends current requirements for certain transformative projects.  Under current law, a residential project with fewer than 700 new residential units is required to include the construction of 50,000 square feet or more of commercial space to qualify as a transformative project.  Under this bill, this requirement is reduced to 20,000 or more of commercial space, which may include retail space. Additionally, the bill permits a parking component to be included in the calculation of the total square footage of a transformative project, but only if constructed in agreement with local zoning, planning, or similar requirements and with the Residential Site Improvement Standards.  Portions of a parking component that exceed local parking requirements or the Residential Site Improvement Standards are not to be included in these calculations.  However, if the project is located within a government restricted municipality, the entire parking component is required to be included in the calculation of square footage requirements for a transformative project, regardless of agreement with local requirements or Residential Site Improvement Standards. Aspire Program Fees The bill requires that the fees charged by the authority under the program be proportional to tax credit amount allowed for a redevelopment project.  The authority is required to promulgate a schedule of fees that are limited to coverage of actual direct costs of administering the program, coverage of reasonable indirect costs of administering the program, and maintenance of reasonable reserves for administering the program. The bill provides that applications submitted prior to the effective date of this bill remain subject to the authoritys fees in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this bill. Applicability to Aspire Program Applications Already Received The bill provides that any application submitted on or after the date six months prior to the bills effective date is subject to the new requirements provided for in the bill, except for the fees imposed on applications that precede the effective date of the bill. Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program Under Aspire Program The bill provides for the establishment of a Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program for the purpose of offering loans or loan guarantees, at the discretion of the authority, to developers whose redevelopment projects have an outstanding financing gap.  The purpose of the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program is to offer additional financing to the developer of a redevelopment project, prior to the issuance of tax credits under the Aspire Program, to ensure the completion of the project. To apply for a loan under the program, the developer is required to submit to the authority a proposed loan and interest amount, a repayment plan, an accounting of the remaining project financing gap, and any other information the authority requires.  To apply for a loan guarantee, the developer is required to submit to the authority a proposed loan guarantee amount and terms, an accounting of the remaining project gap, and any other information the authority requires. The bill authorizes the authority to issue loans and loan guarantees using a Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Revolving Fund, into which all monies received from loan repayments are to be deposited.  All monies received in the fund are to support the program until such time as the authority determines there remains no need for bridge financing, or until December 31, 2028, whichever occurs first, at which point the monies in the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Revolving Fund are to be deposited into the General Fund. The bill requires that the authority recommend to the Governor and the Legislature an amount for appropriation, which amount is necessary for the administration of the Redevelopment Project Bridge Financing Program. Aspire Program Tax Credit Redemption The bill requires the Department of the Treasury to redeem unused tax credits, as the department deems necessary.  The bill authorizes the department to purchase such certificates at a discount of their face value, which discount may not exceed 10 percent.  The tax credit redemptions are to be paid in the same manner as tax refunds, except that the proceeds of the redemption may be issued over one or more tax periods, but not to exceed the eligibility period. Changes to Corporate Business Tax and Gross Income Tax The bill amends current law to exclude gains from the transfer of tax credits issued pursuant to the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 from the calculation of entire net income under the New Jersey Corporate Business Tax and gross income under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax.
