<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the laws
governing the allocation of State aid for auxiliary services and remedial
services to nonpublic school students.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill specifically requires
the Commissioner of Education to establish a process by which school districts
are to be reimbursed for costs that are incurred to provide auxiliary and
remedial services for eligible nonpublic school students.  Under the bill,
school districts are to be reimbursed for costs within the limits of applicable
maximum per service aid amounts, as established by the commissioner.  The
maximum per service aid amounts established by the commissioner are to be based
on projected estimates, for the upcoming school year, of the number of:
services to be provided; students eligible for each service; and the costs to
provide the services.  The estimates used by the commissioner to establish the
maximum per service aid amounts are to be based on trends from recent school
years in the number of services provided, eligible students, and service costs. 
The method by which the commissioner establishes the maximum per service aid
amounts is required to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, the
amounts annually appropriated for auxiliary services and remedial services are
fully exhausted by the end of the school year for which the maximum amounts are
established and that the amounts appropriated are equitably distributed among
school districts applying for reimbursement.  To the extent permitted by
federal law, the commissioner may establish limits on the duration and
frequency of certain auxiliary and remedial services in order to ensure that
the greatest number of eligible students are provided services throughout the
school year and that, to the greatest extent possible, the amount annually
appropriated for the services is available to reimburse school districts during
the entirety of the school year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The reimbursement process to be
implemented by the commissioner pursuant to the bill is to permit school
districts to apply quarterly for reimbursement payments.  The details of the
reimbursement process are to be annually announced on July 15 of the school
year, and districts can begin submitting for reimbursement on September 1.  Reimbursements
are to be made to school districts throughout the school year until the full
amount annually appropriated as State aid for nonpublic school auxiliary and
remedial services has been fully expended. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     School districts seeking
reimbursement under the bill are to submit applications on a quarterly basis
and adhere to all established submission guidelines, accounting and budgeting
guidance, documentation requirements, and defined timelines for reimbursement. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to ensure the full
reimbursement of eligible costs, the bill also removes provisions of law
setting forth the calculation of both categories of aid.  Under current law,
State aid allotments for an upcoming school year are calculated by multiplying
the applicable per pupil service cost by the number of students who were
previously identified as eligible to receive each service.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also removes sections
of current law that: 1) require school districts to refund unexpended State aid
for nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services; and 2) require the commissioner
to prorate State nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services aid amounts
downward, in the event that the amount of State aid appropriated for those
purposes is insufficient.</p>
