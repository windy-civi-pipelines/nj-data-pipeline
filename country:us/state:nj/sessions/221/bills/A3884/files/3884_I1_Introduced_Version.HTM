established in the Executive Branch of the State Government the New Jersey
Transit Corporation, a body corporate and politic with corporate succession. 
For the purpose of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV,
paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, the corporation is hereby allocated
within the Department of Transportation, but, notwithstanding that allocation,
the corporation shall be independent of any supervision or control by the
department or by any body or officer thereof. The corporation is hereby
constituted as an instrumentality of the State exercising public and essential
governmental functions, and the exercise by the corporation of the powers
conferred by this act shall be deemed and held to be an essential governmental
function of the State.  </p>

governed by a board which shall consist of 13 members. </p>

Transportation and the State Treasurer, who shall be members ex officio,
another member of the Executive Branch to be selected by the Governor who shall
also serve ex officio, and eight public members who shall be appointed by the
Governor as follows:</p>

No more than three of the six public members appointed by the Governor with the
advice and consent of the Senate shall be members of the same political party. 
Each public member may be removed from office by the Governor for cause.  A
vacancy in the membership of the board occurring other than by expiration of
term shall be filled in the same manner as the original appointment, but for
the unexpired term only.  The board shall annually designate a <b><span

c.3 (C.27:1B-22.2) under the terms set forth below: a Transportation Master
Plan, a Statewide Capital Investment Strategy, an Annual Transportation Capital
Program, a Transportation Trust Fund Authority Financial Plan, and a Five-Year
Capital Plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     To the end that the
transportation system of the State shall be planned in an orderly and efficient
manner and that the Legislature shall be advised of the nature and extent of
public highways, public transportation projects and other transportation projects
contemplated to be financed under this act, the department shall submit a
master plan, as provided in subsection (a) of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.301
(C.27:1A-5).  Notwithstanding the provisions of that act, the plan shall be for

Budgeting and Planning, the Chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and
the Chairman of the Assembly Transportation and Independent Authorities
Committee, or their successors, and the Legislative Budget and Finance Officer,

five-year intervals thereafter.  The master plan shall set the direction for
the department's overall Capital Investment Strategy and subsequent annual
Transportation Capital Programs submitted to the Legislature for approval
pursuant to this section.  This master plan shall, to the extent practicable,
conform to all federal requirements for Statewide transportation planning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Department of
Transportation, in conjunction with the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the New
Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the South Jersey Transportation Authority, shall
prepare a &quot;Statewide Capital Investment Strategy&quot; for at least a
five-year period which shall contain, at a minimum, a statement of the goals of
the department, the corporation, and the toll road authorities in major
selected policy areas and the means by which the goals are to be attained
during that period, using quantitative measures where appropriate. The
Statewide Capital Investment Strategy may be updated and submitted no later
than March 1 of each year.  The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall
provide for a multi-modal, intermodal, seamless, technologically advanced, and
secure transportation system.  It shall recommend investment for major program
categories, set overall goals for investment in the State's infrastructure, and
develop program targets and performance measures.  It may rely on
infrastructure management systems as developed by the department to assess
bridge conditions, pavement conditions, bridge, traffic and pedestrian safety,
traffic congestion and public transit facilities. With respect to pavement
conditions, the department shall set as a priority the utilization of efficient
cost-effective materials and treatments as stated in section 9 of P.L.2000,
c.73 (C.27:1B-21.22). In the event that there exist appropriate circumstances
for the use of micro-surfacing and cold-in-place recycling, the department
shall establish as a special priority the use of these materials and surface
treatments.  The goals of the Capital Investment Strategy shall include, but
not be limited to, reduction of vehicular and pedestrian accidents, reduction
in the backlog of projects, including one-half of the structurally deficient
bridge repair projects and pavement deficiencies, and an increase in lane miles
of bicycle paths, with a goal of constructing an additional 1,000 lane miles of
bicycle paths in five years to reduce traffic congestion and for recreational
uses. The construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths and facilities
shall be subject to no stricter environmental requirements than are provided
pursuant to federal law and regulations for such lanes, paths and facilities,
notwithstanding the provisions to the contrary of State law and regulations,
including State Executive Order No. 215 of 1989.  With respect to the New
Jersey Transit Corporation, the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall
deal with the corporation's overall goal to keep the public transportation
system in a state of good repair and, more specifically, in the area of bus
transportation, present a strategy and a preliminary timetable for the
replacement of the current diesel bus fleet with a fleet of buses which have
reduced emission of air pollutants.  The corporation shall consider the
feasibility of buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce
particulate emissions and buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel
fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell
vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, and
vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency. The corporation may consider as part of its strategy,
cooperative efforts with bus manufacturers, and the solicitation of federal
support, in developing a &quot;clean bus&quot; with air pollution controls
superior to currently available technology.  For the fiscal year beginning July
1, 2007 and each fiscal year thereafter, all buses purchased by the New Jersey
Transit Corporation shall be buses with improved pollution controls and that
reduce particulate emissions, or buses powered by fuel other than conventional
diesel fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel,
or vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency.  In the event that the corporation is not able
to meet the bus purchase requirements set forth in this section with respect to
any fiscal year, prior to the commencement of the fiscal year, the board of the
corporation shall, by resolution, submit a report to the Legislature detailing
its inability to meet the requirements and the reasons therefor and shall
submit the report to the Senate and General Assembly when both houses are in
session, including therein a request to be exempted from the bus purchase
requirements of this section with regard to the fiscal year in question.  The
President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly shall cause the
date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the
General Assembly.  If a joint resolution approving the exemption is passed by
the Legislature and signed by the Governor prior to the commencement of the
fiscal year in question, the corporation shall be exempt from the requirements
for that fiscal year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the fiscal year beginning
on July 1, 2007 and in each fiscal year thereafter, in the year prior to the
year in which final engineering is anticipated to start on any project which
extends the reach of the New Jersey Transit rail or light rail system, the New
Jersey Transit Corporation shall be required to identify and include in the
annual Statewide Capital Investment Strategy the required State financial
assistance to support operation of the incremental service for the first three
years and the projected fare box recovery ratio at the commencement of the
fourth year of operation of each project.</p>

Investment Strategy shall also detail the planned investment of capital funds

c.150 (C.27:25-2) that in the provision of public transportation services it is
desirable to encourage to the maximum extent feasible the participation of
private enterprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides for changes
to the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) enabling statues to increase
transparency and accountability and the independence of NJ Transit board
members. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u><span style='text-decoration:

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Election of the vice chairperson</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
vice chairperson of the NJ Transit board of directors is to be elected from
among the public voting members of the board.  The vice chairperson is to serve
for a two year term.  The bill prohibits an ex officio member from serving as
the vice-chairperson of the board.  The bill also prohibits designees of ex
officio members from presiding over any board meeting.<br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Public Meetings </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that board
agendas be provided to the public seven calendar days prior to the meeting and
that the board is not to allow more than 60 calendar days to elapse without
holding a public board meeting.  The bill authorizes any board member to request,
through the office of the chair, that a topic of item be included for
discussion or board action at a future board meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Board Hiring</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires that the
board of directors directly hire the Executive Director, Director of the Office
of Customer Advocate, and Auditor General. It also requires board approval of
hiring by the Executive Director for certain positions including all positions at
the level of Senior Vice President and Chief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u><span style='text-decoration:
 none'>&nbsp;</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Board and Committee Transparency
and Accountability</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill subjects major
planning documents to review and approval by the board of directors.  The board
is also required to review and approve any substantial curtailment or
elimination of paratransit service.  The bill requires the board to take an
active role in developing corporate bylaws and to adopt new bylaws within 180
days of the effective date of the bill to ensure consistency with statutory law
governing NJ Transit.  The board is required to ensure that the bylaws are
available to the public and published on NJ Transits website. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, NJ Transit
personnel are required to make audit documents in their final form available to
the members of the board in a centralized database.  If NJ Transit has not yet
established a centralized database for these documents, the bill requires that
the documents be made available to a board member upon request.  The bill
requires NJ Transit senior management to collaborate with the administration
committee on the development of any major fiscal item.  NJ Transit is
prohibited from taking certain action concerning a major fiscal item until the
major fiscal item has been presented to the administration committee.  If the
members of the administration committee find that the major fiscal item should
not advance or needs to be modified, the full board may, at a subsequent board
meeting, require NJ Transit to take action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the Auditor
General and internal audit department of NJ Transit are to report directly to
the audit committee and the board of directors and are to be independent of the
supervision of the Executive Director, unless specifically authorized by the
audit committee or the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill clarifies that each
committee of the board is to serve as an apparatus for members of the committee
to obtain information and to engage in policy discussions within the purview of
the committee.  Upon request of a committee member, NJ Transit personnel is
required to provide information to the committee at a time and in a form and
manner determined by the committee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>       The bill permits the
establishment of any ad hoc or temporary committee to address a specific issue
of interest to the board or the public. Each committee, standing or temporary, is
to submit a committee report to the board for each committee meeting, which is
to include the written summary of the substance of any discussions and any
action taken at the committee meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill states that the
Director of the Office of Customer Advocate, or the directors designee, may
attend any committee meeting to provide pertinent information or commentary to
the committee.  The chairperson of each passenger advisory committee is
authorized to provide pertinent information to any committee but is not
privileged to committee discussion.  The bill also clarifies that the board and
each member of the board remain authorized and obligated to exercise the
functions and responsibilities of each committee and emphasizes that each board
member is required to apply independent judgment while fulfilling the board
members duties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Customer Advocate</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill repeals a provision
of law that requires NJ Transit to employ a customer advocate and, instead,
establishes the Office of Customer Advocate (Customer Advocate) to: provide
information and independent analysis to the NJ Transit board of directors on
the impact that board and NJ Transit actions are having, or are expected to
have, on NJ Transits customers; provide genuine customer input and feedback to
the board of directors, including relaying the needs and concerns of customers
to the board of directors; and represent the best interest of NJ Transits
customers as determined by the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate. 
The Customer Advocate is allocated within the Department of Transportation but
is independent of any supervision or control by the department, provided,
however, that the director of the office is to be supervised by NJ Transits
board of directors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Customer Advocate is
authorized to conduct investigations, initiate studies, conduct research,
present comments and testimony before the board of directors, legislative
committees, and other governmental bodies, and prepare and issue reports.  The
Customer Advocate is required to arrange for meetings with NJ Transit passengers,
on at least a monthly basis, for the purpose of: relaying the concerns and
needs of passengers to the board of directors and the executive management team
of NJ Transit; and providing information to passengers on major board or NJ
Transit actions of which the director has knowledge.  In addition to monthly
meetings, the director of the office may undertake any other action that the
director deems to be in furtherance of the Customer Advocates purposes.  The
Customer Advocate also has the authority to represent the public interest
regarding proposed fare increases, proposed substantial curtailments of
service, proposed expansion of service, and any other action or omission of NJ
Transit that the Customer Advocate determines has an impact on NJ Transits
customers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Customer Advocate is
required to issue an annual report detailing the offices activities for the
prior year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill reduces the number of
persons appointed by the Governor to each passenger advisory committee from six
to five and instead authorizes the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate
to appoint one person to each passenger advisory committee.  The bill also
directs the passenger advisory committees to provide advice, input, and
guidance to the Office of Customer Advocate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><u>Capital Program Public Hearing
and Reporting</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires NJ Transit
to hold at least two public hearings concerning the contents of the annual
capital program before it adopts and implements the program.  The bill also
requires NJ Transit to hold at least two public hearings per year on its
strategic plan, capital program priorities, and vision for NJ Transits
future.  The bill provides requirements for the public hearings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
requirements for the annual transportation capital program report that is
annually submitted to the Legislature as part of the annual budget process. 
This report is a recommendation provided by the Department of Transportation
and NJ Transit for how the State should appropriate the States capital program
appropriations from the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that the
reporting of capital projects in the report be more specific by narrowing the
scope of what is to be reported as a project down to the level of each contract
of $100,000 or more, or a group of contracts totaling more than $100,000 that
are for related work at a single site.  The bill also requires the projects to
be reported in a manner that conveys the scope and scale of work to be
completed over the course of the fiscal year.  These requirements are directed
specifically at the reporting for NJ Transit which has traditionally reported
capital requests in broad categories that obscure the specific capital work to
be completed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
the capital program is to be reported in a document format as is currently the
case, and to also require the reporting of capital program information in a
sortable spreadsheet format.</p>
