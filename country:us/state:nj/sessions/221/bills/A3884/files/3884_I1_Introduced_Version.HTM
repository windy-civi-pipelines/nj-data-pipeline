The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy may be updated and submitted no later than March 1 of each year.  The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall provide for a multi-modal, intermodal, seamless, technologically advanced, and secure transportation system.  It shall recommend investment for major program categories, set overall goals for investment in the State's infrastructure, and develop program targets and performance measures.  It may rely on infrastructure management systems as developed by the department to assess bridge conditions, pavement conditions, bridge, traffic and pedestrian safety, traffic congestion and public transit facilities. With respect to pavement conditions, the department shall set as a priority the utilization of efficient cost-effective materials and treatments as stated in section 9 of P.L.2000, c.73 (C.27:1B-21.22). In the event that there exist appropriate circumstances for the use of micro-surfacing and cold-in-place recycling, the department shall establish as a special priority the use of these materials and surface treatments.  The goals of the Capital Investment Strategy shall include, but not be limited to, reduction of vehicular and pedestrian accidents, reduction in the backlog of projects, including one-half of the structurally deficient bridge repair projects and pavement deficiencies, and an increase in lane miles of bicycle paths, with a goal of constructing an additional 1,000 lane miles of bicycle paths in five years to reduce traffic congestion and for recreational uses. The construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths and facilities shall be subject to no stricter environmental requirements than are provided pursuant to federal law and regulations for such lanes, paths and facilities, notwithstanding the provisions to the contrary of State law and regulations, including State Executive Order No. 215 of 1989.  With respect to the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall deal with the corporation's overall goal to keep the public transportation system in a state of good repair and, more specifically, in the area of bus transportation, present a strategy and a preliminary timetable for the replacement of the current diesel bus fleet with a fleet of buses which have reduced emission of air pollutants.  The corporation shall consider the feasibility of buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce particulate emissions and buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, and vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The corporation may consider as part of its strategy, cooperative efforts with bus manufacturers, and the solicitation of federal support, in developing a "clean bus" with air pollution controls superior to currently available technology.  For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 and each fiscal year thereafter, all buses purchased by the New Jersey Transit Corporation shall be buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce particulate emissions, or buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, or vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  In the event that the corporation is not able to meet the bus purchase requirements set forth in this section with respect to any fiscal year, prior to the commencement of the fiscal year, the board of the corporation shall, by resolution, submit a report to the Legislature detailing its inability to meet the requirements and the reasons therefor and shall submit the report to the Senate and General Assembly when both houses are in session, including therein a request to be exempted from the bus purchase requirements of this section with regard to the fiscal year in question.  The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly.  If a joint resolution approving the exemption is passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor prior to the commencement of the fiscal year in question, the corporation shall be exempt from the requirements for that fiscal year. In the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2007 and in each fiscal year thereafter, in the year prior to the year in which final engineering is anticipated to start on any project which extends the reach of the New Jersey Transit rail or light rail system, the New Jersey Transit Corporation shall be required to identify and include in the annual Statewide Capital Investment Strategy the required State financial assistance to support operation of the incremental service for the first three years and the projected fare box recovery ratio at the commencement of the fourth year of operation of each project. The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall also detail the planned investment of capital funds for public transportation projects of companies other than the New Jersey Transit Corporation engaged in the business of providing motor bus transportation.  The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall demonstrate that such investment adequately addresses the finding in section 2 of P.L.1979, c.150 (C.27:25-2) that in the provision of public transportation services it is desirable to encourage to the maximum extent feasible the participation of private enterprise. c.     On or before March 1 of each year, the commissioner shall submit a report of [general project categories and] proposed capital projects [thereunder] to be financed in the ensuing fiscal year, including therewith a description of the projects, the county or counties and municipality or municipalities within which they are to be located, a distinction between State and local projects, an identification number for each project that can be used to cross reference any project in the State's federal Statewide Transportation Improvement Program, the project phase of work, investment category, project sponsor, governmental entity with jurisdiction over the project and associated infrastructure, the amount estimated to be expended on each project in the year of appropriation, and an estimate of the total project cost.  Proposed appropriations shall be included in the report as a unique project if the spending includes one or more contracts for related work of more than $100,000 at a single site, or for a single contract of at least $100,000 which includes one type of work at multiple locations that is not related to any other capital work required at those locations.  The report shall not group or bundle projects unless the act of grouping or bundling complies with the single site requirement or single contract requirement of this section.  Any group or bundle of projects that is included in the report shall provide specific information concerning the project details, including location, of each component project within the group or bundle.  The reporting of projects should convey a general sense of the scope and scale of work that is intended to be completed over the course of the fiscal year. This report shall be known as the "Annual Transportation Capital Program" for the upcoming fiscal year.  It shall include proposed projects of both the Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation.  The program shall be consistent with, and reflective of, the goals and priorities of the Capital Investment Strategy and the program shall include an explanation which demonstrates how it is consistent with, and reflective of, the goals and priorities. The program shall be transmitted to the Legislature in a document format that lists the projects as well as a spreadsheet format that includes sortable fields for each of the data points required to be included for each project in the program. d.    On or before March 1 of each year, the commissioner shall also submit a "Transportation Trust Fund Authority Financial Plan" designed to implement the financing of the proposed projects.  The financial plan shall contain an enumeration of the bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority which the authority intends to issue, including the amounts thereof and the conditions therefor. The financial plan shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering the authority's proposed operations during the ensuing fiscal year, including amounts of income from all sources, including but not limited to the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations to be issued, as well as interest earned. In addition, the plan shall contain proposed amounts to be appropriated and expended, as well as amounts for which the department anticipates to obligate during the ensuing fiscal year for any future expenditures. e.     The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy, the Annual Transportation Capital Program, and the Transportation Trust Fund Authority Financial Plan shall be submitted to the Senate and General Assembly.  Within 45 days of the receipt thereof, the Senate or the General Assembly may object in writing to the commissioner in regard to any project or projects in the Annual Transportation Capital Program it disapproves or which it is of the opinion should be modified or added to or any additional or alternative projects considered or in regard to any element of the financial plan.  The commissioner shall consider the objections and recommendations and resubmit the report within 10 days, containing therein any modifications based upon the commissioner's consideration of the objections or recommendations. f.     In order that the Legislature shall be advised of the nature and extent of public highways, public transportation projects, and other transportation projects contemplated to be financed under this act, the commissioner shall submit annually, together with the Annual Transportation Capital Program, a Five-Year Capital Plan, which shall set forth projects and programs anticipated to be funded over the five-year period. The Five-Year Capital Plan shall, to the extent practicable, conform to all federal requirements for Statewide transportation capital programming. (cf: P.L.2016, c.56, s.6) 7.    Section 16 of P.L.2018, c.162 (C.27:25-5.27) is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides for changes to the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) enabling statues to increase transparency and accountability and the independence of NJ Transit board members. Election of the vice chairperson The bill provides that the vice chairperson of the NJ Transit board of directors is to be elected from among the public voting members of the board.  The vice chairperson is to serve for a two year term.  The bill prohibits an ex officio member from serving as the vice-chairperson of the board.  The bill also prohibits designees of ex officio members from presiding over any board meeting. Public Meetings The bill requires that board agendas be provided to the public seven calendar days prior to the meeting and that the board is not to allow more than 60 calendar days to elapse without holding a public board meeting.  The bill authorizes any board member to request, through the office of the chair, that a topic of item be included for discussion or board action at a future board meeting. Board Hiring This bill requires that the board of directors directly hire the Executive Director, Director of the Office of Customer Advocate, and Auditor General. It also requires board approval of hiring by the Executive Director for certain positions including all positions at the level of Senior Vice President and Chief. Board and Committee Transparency and Accountability The bill subjects major planning documents to review and approval by the board of directors.  The board is also required to review and approve any substantial curtailment or elimination of paratransit service.  The bill requires the board to take an active role in developing corporate bylaws and to adopt new bylaws within 180 days of the effective date of the bill to ensure consistency with statutory law governing NJ Transit.  The board is required to ensure that the bylaws are available to the public and published on NJ Transits website. Under the bill, NJ Transit personnel are required to make audit documents in their final form available to the members of the board in a centralized database.  If NJ Transit has not yet established a centralized database for these documents, the bill requires that the documents be made available to a board member upon request.  The bill requires NJ Transit senior management to collaborate with the administration committee on the development of any major fiscal item.  NJ Transit is prohibited from taking certain action concerning a major fiscal item until the major fiscal item has been presented to the administration committee.  If the members of the administration committee find that the major fiscal item should not advance or needs to be modified, the full board may, at a subsequent board meeting, require NJ Transit to take action. The bill provides that the Auditor General and internal audit department of NJ Transit are to report directly to the audit committee and the board of directors and are to be independent of the supervision of the Executive Director, unless specifically authorized by the audit committee or the board. The bill clarifies that each committee of the board is to serve as an apparatus for members of the committee to obtain information and to engage in policy discussions within the purview of the committee.  Upon request of a committee member, NJ Transit personnel is required to provide information to the committee at a time and in a form and manner determined by the committee. The bill permits the establishment of any ad hoc or temporary committee to address a specific issue of interest to the board or the public. Each committee, standing or temporary, is to submit a committee report to the board for each committee meeting, which is to include the written summary of the substance of any discussions and any action taken at the committee meeting. The bill states that the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate, or the directors designee, may attend any committee meeting to provide pertinent information or commentary to the committee.  The chairperson of each passenger advisory committee is authorized to provide pertinent information to any committee but is not privileged to committee discussion.  The bill also clarifies that the board and each member of the board remain authorized and obligated to exercise the functions and responsibilities of each committee and emphasizes that each board member is required to apply independent judgment while fulfilling the board members duties. Customer Advocate This bill repeals a provision of law that requires NJ Transit to employ a customer advocate and, instead, establishes the Office of Customer Advocate (Customer Advocate) to: provide information and independent analysis to the NJ Transit board of directors on the impact that board and NJ Transit actions are having, or are expected to have, on NJ Transits customers; provide genuine customer input and feedback to the board of directors, including relaying the needs and concerns of customers to the board of directors; and represent the best interest of NJ Transits customers as determined by the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate. The Customer Advocate is allocated within the Department of Transportation but is independent of any supervision or control by the department, provided, however, that the director of the office is to be supervised by NJ Transits board of directors. The Customer Advocate is authorized to conduct investigations, initiate studies, conduct research, present comments and testimony before the board of directors, legislative committees, and other governmental bodies, and prepare and issue reports.  The Customer Advocate is required to arrange for meetings with NJ Transit passengers, on at least a monthly basis, for the purpose of: relaying the concerns and needs of passengers to the board of directors and the executive management team of NJ Transit; and providing information to passengers on major board or NJ Transit actions of which the director has knowledge.  In addition to monthly meetings, the director of the office may undertake any other action that the director deems to be in furtherance of the Customer Advocates purposes.  The Customer Advocate also has the authority to represent the public interest regarding proposed fare increases, proposed substantial curtailments of service, proposed expansion of service, and any other action or omission of NJ Transit that the Customer Advocate determines has an impact on NJ Transits customers. The Customer Advocate is required to issue an annual report detailing the offices activities for the prior year. The bill reduces the number of persons appointed by the Governor to each passenger advisory committee from six to five and instead authorizes the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate to appoint one person to each passenger advisory committee.  The bill also directs the passenger advisory committees to provide advice, input, and guidance to the Office of Customer Advocate. Capital Program Public Hearing and Reporting The bill requires NJ Transit to hold at least two public hearings concerning the contents of the annual capital program before it adopts and implements the program.  The bill also requires NJ Transit to hold at least two public hearings per year on its strategic plan, capital program priorities, and vision for NJ Transits future.  The bill provides requirements for the public hearings. This bill amends the requirements for the annual transportation capital program report that is annually submitted to the Legislature as part of the annual budget process. This report is a recommendation provided by the Department of Transportation and NJ Transit for how the State should appropriate the States capital program appropriations from the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund. The bill requires that the reporting of capital projects in the report be more specific by narrowing the scope of what is to be reported as a project down to the level of each contract of $100,000 or more, or a group of contracts totaling more than $100,000 that are for related work at a single site.  The bill also requires the projects to be reported in a manner that conveys the scope and scale of work to be completed over the course of the fiscal year.  These requirements are directed specifically at the reporting for NJ Transit which has traditionally reported capital requests in broad categories that obscure the specific capital work to be completed. The bill also provides that the capital program is to be reported in a document format as is currently the case, and to also require the reporting of capital program information in a sortable spreadsheet format.

With respect to pavement conditions, the department shall set as a priority the utilization of efficient cost-effective materials and treatments as stated in section 9 of P.L.2000, c.73 (C.27:1B-21.22). In the event that there exist appropriate circumstances for the use of micro-surfacing and cold-in-place recycling, the department shall establish as a special priority the use of these materials and surface treatments.  The goals of the Capital Investment Strategy shall include, but not be limited to, reduction of vehicular and pedestrian accidents, reduction in the backlog of projects, including one-half of the structurally deficient bridge repair projects and pavement deficiencies, and an increase in lane miles of bicycle paths, with a goal of constructing an additional 1,000 lane miles of bicycle paths in five years to reduce traffic congestion and for recreational uses. The construction of bicycle and pedestrian lanes, paths and facilities shall be subject to no stricter environmental requirements than are provided pursuant to federal law and regulations for such lanes, paths and facilities, notwithstanding the provisions to the contrary of State law and regulations, including State Executive Order No. 215 of 1989.  With respect to the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall deal with the corporation's overall goal to keep the public transportation system in a state of good repair and, more specifically, in the area of bus transportation, present a strategy and a preliminary timetable for the replacement of the current diesel bus fleet with a fleet of buses which have reduced emission of air pollutants.  The corporation shall consider the feasibility of buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce particulate emissions and buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, and vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The corporation may consider as part of its strategy, cooperative efforts with bus manufacturers, and the solicitation of federal support, in developing a "clean bus" with air pollution controls superior to currently available technology.  For the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 and each fiscal year thereafter, all buses purchased by the New Jersey Transit Corporation shall be buses with improved pollution controls and that reduce particulate emissions, or buses powered by fuel other than conventional diesel fuel, such as compressed natural gas vehicles, hybrid vehicles, fuel cell vehicles, biodiesel vehicles, vehicles operated on ultra low sulfur fuel, or vehicles operated on any other bus fuel approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  In the event that the corporation is not able to meet the bus purchase requirements set forth in this section with respect to any fiscal year, prior to the commencement of the fiscal year, the board of the corporation shall, by resolution, submit a report to the Legislature detailing its inability to meet the requirements and the reasons therefor and shall submit the report to the Senate and General Assembly when both houses are in session, including therein a request to be exempted from the bus purchase requirements of this section with regard to the fiscal year in question.  The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the General Assembly shall cause the date of submission to be entered upon the Senate Journal and the Minutes of the General Assembly.  If a joint resolution approving the exemption is passed by the Legislature and signed by the Governor prior to the commencement of the fiscal year in question, the corporation shall be exempt from the requirements for that fiscal year. In the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 2007 and in each fiscal year thereafter, in the year prior to the year in which final engineering is anticipated to start on any project which extends the reach of the New Jersey Transit rail or light rail system, the New Jersey Transit Corporation shall be required to identify and include in the annual Statewide Capital Investment Strategy the required State financial assistance to support operation of the incremental service for the first three years and the projected fare box recovery ratio at the commencement of the fourth year of operation of each project. The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall also detail the planned investment of capital funds for public transportation projects of companies other than the New Jersey Transit Corporation engaged in the business of providing motor bus transportation.  The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy shall demonstrate that such investment adequately addresses the finding in section 2 of P.L.1979, c.150 (C.27:25-2) that in the provision of public transportation services it is desirable to encourage to the maximum extent feasible the participation of private enterprise. c.     On or before March 1 of each year, the commissioner shall submit a report of [general project categories and] proposed capital projects [thereunder] to be financed in the ensuing fiscal year, including therewith a description of the projects, the county or counties and municipality or municipalities within which they are to be located, a distinction between State and local projects, an identification number for each project that can be used to cross reference any project in the State's federal Statewide Transportation Improvement Program, the project phase of work, investment category, project sponsor, governmental entity with jurisdiction over the project and associated infrastructure, the amount estimated to be expended on each project in the year of appropriation, and an estimate of the total project cost.  Proposed appropriations shall be included in the report as a unique project if the spending includes one or more contracts for related work of more than $100,000 at a single site, or for a single contract of at least $100,000 which includes one type of work at multiple locations that is not related to any other capital work required at those locations.  The report shall not group or bundle projects unless the act of grouping or bundling complies with the single site requirement or single contract requirement of this section.  Any group or bundle of projects that is included in the report shall provide specific information concerning the project details, including location, of each component project within the group or bundle.  The reporting of projects should convey a general sense of the scope and scale of work that is intended to be completed over the course of the fiscal year. This report shall be known as the "Annual Transportation Capital Program" for the upcoming fiscal year.  It shall include proposed projects of both the Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation.  The program shall be consistent with, and reflective of, the goals and priorities of the Capital Investment Strategy and the program shall include an explanation which demonstrates how it is consistent with, and reflective of, the goals and priorities. The program shall be transmitted to the Legislature in a document format that lists the projects as well as a spreadsheet format that includes sortable fields for each of the data points required to be included for each project in the program. d.    On or before March 1 of each year, the commissioner shall also submit a "Transportation Trust Fund Authority Financial Plan" designed to implement the financing of the proposed projects.  The financial plan shall contain an enumeration of the bonds, notes or other obligations of the authority which the authority intends to issue, including the amounts thereof and the conditions therefor. The financial plan shall set forth a complete operating and financial statement covering the authority's proposed operations during the ensuing fiscal year, including amounts of income from all sources, including but not limited to the proceeds of bonds, notes or other obligations to be issued, as well as interest earned. In addition, the plan shall contain proposed amounts to be appropriated and expended, as well as amounts for which the department anticipates to obligate during the ensuing fiscal year for any future expenditures. e.     The Statewide Capital Investment Strategy, the Annual Transportation Capital Program, and the Transportation Trust Fund Authority Financial Plan shall be submitted to the Senate and General Assembly.  Within 45 days of the receipt thereof, the Senate or the General Assembly may object in writing to the commissioner in regard to any project or projects in the Annual Transportation Capital Program it disapproves or which it is of the opinion should be modified or added to or any additional or alternative projects considered or in regard to any element of the financial plan.  The commissioner shall consider the objections and recommendations and resubmit the report within 10 days, containing therein any modifications based upon the commissioner's consideration of the objections or recommendations. f.     In order that the Legislature shall be advised of the nature and extent of public highways, public transportation projects, and other transportation projects contemplated to be financed under this act, the commissioner shall submit annually, together with the Annual Transportation Capital Program, a Five-Year Capital Plan, which shall set forth projects and programs anticipated to be funded over the five-year period. The Five-Year Capital Plan shall, to the extent practicable, conform to all federal requirements for Statewide transportation capital programming. (cf: P.L.2016, c.56, s.6) 7.    Section 16 of P.L.2018, c.162 (C.27:25-5.27) is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides for changes to the New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJ Transit) enabling statues to increase transparency and accountability and the independence of NJ Transit board members. Election of the vice chairperson The bill provides that the vice chairperson of the NJ Transit board of directors is to be elected from among the public voting members of the board.  The vice chairperson is to serve for a two year term.  The bill prohibits an ex officio member from serving as the vice-chairperson of the board.  The bill also prohibits designees of ex officio members from presiding over any board meeting. Public Meetings The bill requires that board agendas be provided to the public seven calendar days prior to the meeting and that the board is not to allow more than 60 calendar days to elapse without holding a public board meeting.  The bill authorizes any board member to request, through the office of the chair, that a topic of item be included for discussion or board action at a future board meeting. Board Hiring This bill requires that the board of directors directly hire the Executive Director, Director of the Office of Customer Advocate, and Auditor General. It also requires board approval of hiring by the Executive Director for certain positions including all positions at the level of Senior Vice President and Chief. Board and Committee Transparency and Accountability The bill subjects major planning documents to review and approval by the board of directors.  The board is also required to review and approve any substantial curtailment or elimination of paratransit service.  The bill requires the board to take an active role in developing corporate bylaws and to adopt new bylaws within 180 days of the effective date of the bill to ensure consistency with statutory law governing NJ Transit.  The board is required to ensure that the bylaws are available to the public and published on NJ Transits website. Under the bill, NJ Transit personnel are required to make audit documents in their final form available to the members of the board in a centralized database.  If NJ Transit has not yet established a centralized database for these documents, the bill requires that the documents be made available to a board member upon request.  The bill requires NJ Transit senior management to collaborate with the administration committee on the development of any major fiscal item.  NJ Transit is prohibited from taking certain action concerning a major fiscal item until the major fiscal item has been presented to the administration committee.  If the members of the administration committee find that the major fiscal item should not advance or needs to be modified, the full board may, at a subsequent board meeting, require NJ Transit to take action. The bill provides that the Auditor General and internal audit department of NJ Transit are to report directly to the audit committee and the board of directors and are to be independent of the supervision of the Executive Director, unless specifically authorized by the audit committee or the board. The bill clarifies that each committee of the board is to serve as an apparatus for members of the committee to obtain information and to engage in policy discussions within the purview of the committee.  Upon request of a committee member, NJ Transit personnel is required to provide information to the committee at a time and in a form and manner determined by the committee. The bill permits the establishment of any ad hoc or temporary committee to address a specific issue of interest to the board or the public. Each committee, standing or temporary, is to submit a committee report to the board for each committee meeting, which is to include the written summary of the substance of any discussions and any action taken at the committee meeting. The bill states that the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate, or the directors designee, may attend any committee meeting to provide pertinent information or commentary to the committee.  The chairperson of each passenger advisory committee is authorized to provide pertinent information to any committee but is not privileged to committee discussion.  The bill also clarifies that the board and each member of the board remain authorized and obligated to exercise the functions and responsibilities of each committee and emphasizes that each board member is required to apply independent judgment while fulfilling the board members duties. Customer Advocate This bill repeals a provision of law that requires NJ Transit to employ a customer advocate and, instead, establishes the Office of Customer Advocate (Customer Advocate) to: provide information and independent analysis to the NJ Transit board of directors on the impact that board and NJ Transit actions are having, or are expected to have, on NJ Transits customers; provide genuine customer input and feedback to the board of directors, including relaying the needs and concerns of customers to the board of directors; and represent the best interest of NJ Transits customers as determined by the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate. The Customer Advocate is allocated within the Department of Transportation but is independent of any supervision or control by the department, provided, however, that the director of the office is to be supervised by NJ Transits board of directors. The Customer Advocate is authorized to conduct investigations, initiate studies, conduct research, present comments and testimony before the board of directors, legislative committees, and other governmental bodies, and prepare and issue reports.  The Customer Advocate is required to arrange for meetings with NJ Transit passengers, on at least a monthly basis, for the purpose of: relaying the concerns and needs of passengers to the board of directors and the executive management team of NJ Transit; and providing information to passengers on major board or NJ Transit actions of which the director has knowledge.  In addition to monthly meetings, the director of the office may undertake any other action that the director deems to be in furtherance of the Customer Advocates purposes.  The Customer Advocate also has the authority to represent the public interest regarding proposed fare increases, proposed substantial curtailments of service, proposed expansion of service, and any other action or omission of NJ Transit that the Customer Advocate determines has an impact on NJ Transits customers. The Customer Advocate is required to issue an annual report detailing the offices activities for the prior year. The bill reduces the number of persons appointed by the Governor to each passenger advisory committee from six to five and instead authorizes the Director of the Office of Customer Advocate to appoint one person to each passenger advisory committee.  The bill also directs the passenger advisory committees to provide advice, input, and guidance to the Office of Customer Advocate. Capital Program Public Hearing and Reporting The bill requires NJ Transit to hold at least two public hearings concerning the contents of the annual capital program before it adopts and implements the program.  The bill also requires NJ Transit to hold at least two public hearings per year on its strategic plan, capital program priorities, and vision for NJ Transits future.  The bill provides requirements for the public hearings. This bill amends the requirements for the annual transportation capital program report that is annually submitted to the Legislature as part of the annual budget process. This report is a recommendation provided by the Department of Transportation and NJ Transit for how the State should appropriate the States capital program appropriations from the New Jersey Transportation Trust Fund. The bill requires that the reporting of capital projects in the report be more specific by narrowing the scope of what is to be reported as a project down to the level of each contract of $100,000 or more, or a group of contracts totaling more than $100,000 that are for related work at a single site.  The bill also requires the projects to be reported in a manner that conveys the scope and scale of work to be completed over the course of the fiscal year.  These requirements are directed specifically at the reporting for NJ Transit which has traditionally reported capital requests in broad categories that obscure the specific capital work to be completed. The bill also provides that the capital program is to be reported in a document format as is currently the case, and to also require the reporting of capital program information in a sortable spreadsheet format.
