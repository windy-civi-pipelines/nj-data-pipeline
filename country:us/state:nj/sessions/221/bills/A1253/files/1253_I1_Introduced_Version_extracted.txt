STATEMENT This bill would prohibit the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) from planting non-native plant species as part of the landscaping of a State park or forest.  The bill would also direct the DEP to establish a grant program to provide funds to local governments that seek to plant native plants at local parks and forests. As used in the bill, "native plant" means a plant species that occurs naturally in New Jersey or the greater Mid-Atlantic region, either because it evolved here or because it established itself here without human assistance.  The injunction on the use of non-native plants would take effect three months after the bill's enactment, in order to allow the DEP to utilize any remaining nursery stock it has acquired or contracted for. Each grant awarded under the grant program would be for a maximum of $5,000, although a local government could apply for more than one grant per year.  Under the bill, the DEP would determine the eligibility conditions, priority ranking of projects, and application procedures for the program.  The bill would require the DEP to report to Governor and the Legislature on the progress of the program in achieving its goals, and would require the DEP Commissioner to request sufficient funds in the DEP's annual budget request to execute the program.
