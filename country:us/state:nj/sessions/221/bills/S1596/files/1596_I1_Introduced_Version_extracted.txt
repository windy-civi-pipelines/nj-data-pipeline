STATEMENT This bill authorizes the creation of Juneteenth commemorative license plates by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC).  The license plates are to cost $50 for the initial application and $10 annually thereafter for renewal, in addition to other registration fees.  Monies collected from the license plate program are to be deposited in a special fund called the Juneteenth License Plate Fund.  The monies deposited in the fund are to be appropriated annually to the New Jersey Historical Commission and are to be used by the New Jersey Historical Commission to commemorate and celebrate Juneteenth. The bill provides that public funds are not to be used for the initial costs of establishing the Juneteenth license plate program.  Prior to deposit in the Juneteenth License Plate Fund, monies from the license plate program are to be provided to the MVC to offset the costs of implementing the license plate program.  In addition, prior to designing, producing, issuing, or publicizing the availability of Juneteenth license plates, or making any necessary programming changes, the following requirements are required to be met: (1)  an individual or entity designated by the New Jersey Historical Commission must provide the MVC with the non-public monies necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the MVC in establishing the Juneteenth license plate program; and (2)  a liaison appointed by the New Jersey Historical Commission pursuant to the bill is required to provide the MVC with not less than 500 completed applications for Juneteenth license plates.
