A3036 3R [Third Reprint] ASSEMBLY, No. 3036 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  CLINTON CALABRESE District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Carter, Assemblymen Stanley, Atkins, Karabinchak, Assemblywoman Reynolds-Jackson, Assemblyman Sampson, Assemblywomen Donlon and Peterpaul SYNOPSIS Swift Access For Emergency Response Actions Preservation Program (SAFER APP); authorizes Attorney General to order turn-by-turn navigation systems to reroute vehicular traffic under certain conditions. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on June 26, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning turn-by-turn navigation systems and supplementing Title 39 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the Swift Access For Emergency Response Actions Preservation Program (SAFER APP). 22.   The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The safety and well-being of New Jersey residents is a fundamental responsibility of the State and its municipalities, particularly with regard to ensuring timely and reliable emergency response services. b.    The widespread use of turn-by-turn navigation applications has, in certain communities, contributed to unintended traffic congestion on residential and local roads not designed to handle significant volumes of through-traffic. c.     This congestion has demonstrably delayed emergency vehicle access, increased the frequency of vehicular and pedestrian accidents, and compromised the operational readiness of police, fire, and emergency medical services. d.    It is in the public interest to provide municipalities and the Attorney General with a process to reroute traffic via turn-by-turn navigation applications in order to preserve public safety and emergency access during periods of sustained, dangerous congestion. e.     The enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) serves the compelling governmental interest in safeguarding public safety and maintaining the operational capacity of emergency response systems. f.     Any incidental impact on interstate or intrastate commerce resulting from limited, localized traffic rerouting orders issued pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is justified by the overriding interest in public safety, and P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) is narrowly tailored to ensure that the means adopted do not impose unnecessary or discriminatory burdens on commerce. g.    The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Transportation shall implement P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in a manner consistent with Constitutional principles, including the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and shall coordinate to avoid unnecessary disruption to freight corridors, ensuring that any emergency traffic control measures are time-limited and regularly reviewed to minimize ongoing interference. h. P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) does not restrict physical access to public roads by drivers but instead provides a targeted and temporary framework for regulating digital routing behavior in emergency conditions, consistent with the States authority to protect public safety.2 2[2.] 3[3.2 As used in P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): 2"Commissioner" means the Commissioner of Transportation.2 2[]"2 Emergency 1traffic1 condition 2[]"2 means 1recurring periods of1 excessive vehicular traffic that 1[poses] 2[pose1 a public safety hazard, including, but not limited to: sustained congestion on highways, streets, and roadways; emergency vehicle dispatch delays; or a demonstrable history of vehicular and pedestrian accidents] materially interfere with emergency response operations or endanger public safety, including but not limited to: significant diversion of traffic from highways onto roads not intended or engineered to accommodate the volume of the diverted traffic; substantiated delays in emergency vehicle response times; or a pattern of vehicular or pedestrian accidents associated with changes in routing behavior2. 2[]"2 Turn-by-turn navigation system 2[]"2 means a software program or online application on a device that uses global positioning system technology to provide a driver with voice-guided or visual instructions on how to arrive at a destination using a motor vehicle.]3 2[3.] 3[4.2  a.  The governing body of a municipality may adopt a resolution 2, accompanied by supporting documentation and analysis,2 requesting the Attorney General to investigate whether use of turn-by-turn navigation systems by drivers 2[creates] has created2 an emergency 1traffic1 condition within the municipality, 2[which, after adoption,] as defined in section 3 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The resolution and accompanying documentation, after adoption by the municipal governing body,2 shall be subject to the review of the Commissioner of Transportation, according to law. 2[The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the resolution within 90 days of the date the governing body of a municipality submits the resolution to the commissioner. If the commissioner disapproves the resolution, the commissioner shall describe in writing the reasoning of the disapproval to the governing body of the municipality.]2 b.   2In reviewing the resolution, the commissioner may consider criteria including, but not limited to: (1)  traffic volume and congestion on the roads to which traffic is diverted; (2)  frequency of accidents, speed limit violations, or other moving violations; (3)  emergency response times; and (4)  comparative travel time savings for drivers using diverted routes versus primary highways. c.   The commissioner shall approve or disapprove the resolution within 90 days of the date the governing body of a municipality submits the resolution to the commissioner.  If the commissioner disapproves the resolution, the commissioner shall provide, in writing, a description on the reasoning of the disapproval to the governing body of the municipality.2 2[b.] d.
