The bill provides a tenant-buyer with a right to obtain an independent property inspection before signing a rent-to-own agreement and, if the agreement provides an option to purchase at a later date, prior to the tenant-buyer exercising that option.  The landlord-seller is also to provide the tenant-buyer with: · a signed property condition disclosure statement, as provided for in section 1 of P.L.1999, c.76 (C.56:8-19.1); · a full accounting of how payments will be applied toward ownership; · a notice of any existing liens or legal claims on the property; · proof of the receipt of a certificate of occupancy for the property, obtained no more than six months prior to entrance into the agreement; and · any other information that the commissioner determines necessary to effectuate the purposes of the bill, and that is in the public interest.

A violation of the provisions of the bill is to constitute an unlawful practice under the New Jersey consumer fraud act (CFA), and subject to all applicable penalties set forth in the CFA. The bill permits a tenant-buyer who has been harmed by a violation of the bill to initiate a civil action for actual damages, statutory damages of $10,000, attorneys fees, costs for expert witnesses, other costs incurred in proving a violation of the bill, and injunctive relief.  The bill also provides the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs in the Department of Law and Public Safety (director) with enforcement authority to investigate violations and impose penalties.
