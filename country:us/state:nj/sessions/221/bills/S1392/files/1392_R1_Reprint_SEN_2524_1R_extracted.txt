The standards for the Community Solar Energy Pilot Program shall include, but need not be limited to, a verification process to ensure that the solar energy projects are producing an amount of energy that is greater than or equal to the amount of energy that is being credited to its participating customer's electric utility bills pursuant to subsection b. of this section, and consumer protection measures.  Projects approved by the board shall have at least two participating customers. The board may restrict qualified solar energy projects to those located on brownfields, landfills, areas designated in need of redevelopment, in underserved communities, or on commercial rooftops. e.     Subject to review by the board, an electric public utility shall be entitled to full and timely cost recovery for all costs incurred in implementation and compliance with this section. f.     No later than 36 months after adoption of the rules and regulations required pursuant to subsection b. of this section, 1[or no later than the date on which the board adopts rules and regulations establishing a permanent successor to the SREC program pursuant to P.L.2021, c.169 (C.48:3-114 et al.), whichever date is earlier,]1 the board shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to convert the Community Solar Energy Pilot Program to a permanent program.

(cf: P.L.2018, c.17, s.5) 5.    (New section)  The board shall conduct a study to examine utility rate schedules applied to customers living in multi-family housing served by a single meter, and the community solar bill credits and effective savings available to those customers.  The study shall assess whether customers living in multi-family housing are eligible to receive similar financial benefits from community solar participation as those customers residing in single-family residences, and make suggestions for legislative or regulatory action to ensure the equitable distribution of the benefits and cost-savings of community solar.  In conducting the study, the board shall solicit comments from utilities, public interest groups, and other interested parties.  The board shall report its findings to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), the Legislature no later than 270 days after the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.    This act shall take effect immediately.
