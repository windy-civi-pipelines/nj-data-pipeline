Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  There
is established in the Board of Public Utilities an Office of Clean Energy
Equity.  The office shall promote, guide, and oversee the equitable deployment
of clean energy, energy efficiency, and energy storage programs and technologies
in overburdened communities, and the equitable provision of the tangible benefits
of clean energy, increased energy efficiency, and energy storage at the
household and community level, including clean energy asset ownership, energy
cost savings, and employment and economic opportunities, to overburdened
communities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The board shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   establish onsite solar
or community solar programs, including, but not limited to, programs using
solar facilities installed, owned, and operated by independent, non-utility providers,
which benefit 250,000 low income households or 35 percent of the low income
households in the State, whichever is larger, by 2030, with the goal of reducing
these households average energy burden to below six percent of household
income, as defined by the United States Department of Energy Low Income Energy
Affordability Data Tool.  The board may implement the programs required
pursuant to this paragraph in conjunction with existing renewable energy and
energy efficiency programs or services; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   require the
establishment of a minimum of 1,600 megawatt<u> </u>hours of energy storage in
overburdened communities, capable of<u> </u>delivering 400 megawatts of power,
by 2030, which shall be sited in public facilities, as part of a microgrid
connected to a public facility serving as a community energy resiliency hub, be
directly sited in low income households, or be sited so as to otherwise increase
the resiliency and reduce the energy burden of overburdened communities.  In
establishing the energy storage required pursuant to this paragraph, the office
shall ensure that a community energy resilience hub is powered by clean energy,
is community-based and community-centric, is inclusive of community-based
organizations, and prioritizes the deployment of energy services to local
residents during natural disasters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The board, in
cooperation with the Office of Clean Energy Equity, shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   integrate workforce
development training into all clean energy and energy storage programs
established by the board; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   provide outreach and
recruitment campaign grants to community-based organizations to increase
participation by residents of overburdened communities in clean energy and
energy efficiency programs by hiring residents to conduct outreach and public
education in those communities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   develop, in coordination
with community-based organizations, outreach materials concerning the
provisions of this act in multiple languages that are easy to deliver through
multiple media; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   appoint a community
liaison and establish an advisory board consisting of representatives of
overburdened communities responsible for conducting an internal and external
review and evaluation of all clean energy and energy storage programs available
to overburdened communities and provide annual recommendations to the board on
unmet needs in overburdened communities and suggestions for improvements to
those programs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   coordinate with the
Department of Labor and Workforce Development concerning the requirements of
section 2 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.      )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill) and with the Department of
Community Affairs concerning the requirements of section 3 of P.L.    , c.  
(C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1) The board shall
direct no less than 10 percent of the boards annual total clean energy budget,
or at least $50 million annually, whichever is greater, to the Office of Clean
Energy Equity to implement the provisions of this section.  All programs,
incentives, and other financing shall be appropriately structured to address
the unique barriers faced by low income households and overburdened
communities.  Funding directed pursuant to this subsection shall be
supplemental to, and not replace, any funds allocated to energy efficiency services
for low income households managed or required by the board on the effective
date of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.      )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The board may allocate
additional funding, staff, and resources to the Office of Clean Energy Equity
as the board determines appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Of the funds annually directed
by the board to the Office of Clean Energy Equity pursuant to this paragraph,
an amount not to exceed five percent may be used each year for costs associated
with program administration, including costs incurred related to marketing,
outreach, reporting, and evaluation activities to implement the provisions of
this section.  The Office of Clean Energy Equity may contract with a third
party administrator with experience deploying solar energy and energy storage
in overburdened communities to implement the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The board shall consult
