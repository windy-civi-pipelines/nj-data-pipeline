concerning domestic violence offenders and amending and supplementing P.L.1991,
c.261, and making an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.      Section 11 of
P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-27) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.    a.  When a defendant is
found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence and a condition
of sentence restricts the defendant's ability to have contact with the victim,
the victim's friends, co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed,
leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the
household, that condition shall be recorded in an order of the court and a
written copy of that order shall be provided to the victim by the clerk of the
court or other person designated by the court. In addition to restricting a
defendant's ability to have contact with the victim, the victim's friends,
co-workers, or relatives, or an animal owned, possessed, leased, kept, or held
by either party or a minor child residing in the household, the court may
require the defendant to receive professional counseling from either a private
source or a source appointed by the court, and if the court so orders, the
court shall require the defendant to provide documentation of attendance at the
professional counseling.  In any case where the court order contains a
requirement that the defendant receive professional counseling, no application
by the defendant to dissolve the restraining order shall be granted unless, in
addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions ordered by the
court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In addition the court
may enter an order directing the possession of an animal owned, possessed,
leased, kept, or held by either party or a minor child residing in the
household. Where a person has abused or threatened to abuse such animal, there
shall be a presumption that possession of the animal shall be awarded to the
non-abusive party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1)  When a defendant
is found guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence, the court
shall inform the defendant that the defendant is prohibited from purchasing,
owning, possessing, or controlling a firearm pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1979,
c.179 (C.2C:39-7) and from receiving or retaining a firearms purchaser
identification card or permit to purchase a handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3. 
The court shall order the defendant to arrange for the immediate surrender to a
law enforcement officer of any firearm that has not already been seized or
surrendered and any firearms purchaser identification card or permit to
purchase a handgun possessed by the defendant.  No later than five business
days after the order is entered, however, the defendant may arrange to sell any
surrendered firearm to a licensed retail dealer of firearms who shall be
authorized to take possession of that purchased firearm from the law
enforcement agency to which it was surrendered no later than 10 business days
after the order is entered. Any card or permit issued to the defendant shall be
deemed immediately revoked.  The court shall establish a process for notifying
the appropriate authorities of the conviction requiring the revocation of the
card or permit.  A law enforcement officer accepting a surrendered firearm
shall provide the defendant with a receipt listing the date of surrender, the
name of the defendant, and any item that has been surrendered, including the
serial number, manufacturer, and model of the surrendered firearm.  The
defendant shall provide a copy of this receipt to the prosecutor within 48
hours of service of the order, and shall attest under penalty that any firearms
owned or possessed at the time of the order have been transferred in accordance
with this section and that the defendant currently does not possess any
firearms. The defendant alternatively may attest under penalty that he did not
own or possess a firearm at the time of the order and currently does not
possess a firearm.  If the court, upon motion of the prosecutor, finds probable
cause that the defendant has failed to surrender any firearm, card, or permit,
the court may order a search for and removal of these items at any location
where the judge has reasonable cause to believe these items are located.  The
judge shall state with specificity the reasons for and the scope of the search
and seizure authorized by the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   A law enforcement
officer who receives a firearm that is surrendered, but not purchased and taken
possession of by a licensed retail dealer of firearms within 10 business days
of when the order is entered pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may dispose
of the surrendered firearm in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.2C:64-6. 
A firearm purchased by a licensed retail dealer from a defendant shall become
part of the inventory of the dealer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      <u>d.   (1) In addition, the
court may order the electronic monitoring, utilizing global positioning system
technology, of a convicted defendant referred to in subsection a. of this
section who is deemed to present a serious risk of re-offense.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)   In exercising
judicial discretion in determining subjects to monitor electronically, the
court shall consider the risks posed by the subject, based on relevant risk
factors such as the seriousness of the offense upon which the conviction was
based and any other factors the court deems appropriate.</u> </p>

c.261 (C.2C:25-29) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.     a.  A hearing shall be
held in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court within
10 days of the filing of a complaint pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1991, c.261
(C.2C:25-28) in the county where the ex parte restraints were ordered, unless
good cause is shown for the hearing to be held elsewhere. A copy of the
complaint shall be served on the defendant in conformity with the Rules of
Court. If a criminal complaint arising out of the same incident which is the
subject matter of a complaint brought under P.L.1981, c.426
(C.2C:25-1&nbsp;et&nbsp;seq.)&nbsp;or P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-17 et seq.) has
been filed, testimony given by the plaintiff or defendant in the domestic
violence matter shall not be used in the simultaneous or subsequent criminal
proceeding against the defendant, other than domestic violence contempt matters
and where it would otherwise be admissible hearsay under the rules of evidence
that govern where a party is unavailable.  At the hearing the standard for
proving the allegations in the complaint shall be by a preponderance of the
evidence.  The court shall consider but not be limited to the following
factors:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The previous history of
domestic violence between the plaintiff and defendant, including threats,
harassment and physical abuse; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The existence of
immediate danger to person or property; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The financial
circumstances of the plaintiff and defendant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The best interests of
the victim and any child; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   In determining custody
and parenting time the protection of the victim's safety; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   The existence of a
verifiable order of protection from another jurisdiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An order issued under this act
shall only restrain or provide damages payable from a person against whom a
complaint has been filed under this act and only after a finding or an
admission is made that an act of domestic violence was committed by that
person.  The issue of whether or not a violation of this act occurred,
including an act of contempt under this act, shall not be subject to mediation
or negotiation in any form.  In addition, where a temporary or final order has
been issued pursuant to this act, no party shall be ordered to participate in
mediation on the issue of custody or parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      b.   In proceedings in which
complaints for restraining orders have been filed, the court shall grant any
relief necessary to prevent further abuse.  In addition to any other
provisions, any restraining order issued by the court shall bar the defendant
from purchasing, owning, possessing or controlling a firearm and from receiving
or retaining a firearms purchaser identification card or permit to purchase a
handgun pursuant to N.J.S.2C:58-3 during the period in which the restraining
order is in effect or two years, whichever is greater. The order shall require
the immediate surrender of any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant. The order shall include notice to the defendant of the penalties for
a violation of any provision of the order, including but not limited to the
penalties for contempt of court and unlawful possession of a firearm or other
weapon pursuant to N.J.S.2C:39-5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A law enforcement officer
shall accompany the defendant, or may proceed without the defendant if
necessary, to any place where any firearm or other weapon belonging to the
defendant is located to ensure that the defendant does not gain access to any
firearm or other weapon, and a law enforcement officer shall take custody of any
firearm or other weapon belonging to the defendant.  If the order prohibits the
defendant from returning to the scene of domestic violence or other place where
firearms or other weapons belonging to the defendant are located, any firearm
or other weapon located there shall be seized by a law enforcement officer. 
The provisions of this subsection requiring the surrender or removal of a
firearm, card, or permit shall not apply to any law enforcement officer while
actually on duty, or to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States or
member of the National Guard while actually on duty or traveling to or from an
authorized place of duty.  At the hearing the judge of the Family Part of the
Chancery Division of the Superior Court may issue an order granting any or all
of the following relief:  </p>

of whether the residence or household is jointly or solely owned by the parties
or jointly or solely leased by the parties.  This order shall not in any manner
affect title or interest to any real property held by either party or both
jointly.  If it is not possible for the victim to remain in the residence, the
court may order the defendant to pay the victim's rent at a residence other
than the one previously shared by the parties if the defendant is found to have
a duty to support the victim and the victim requires alternative housing.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   An order providing for
parenting time. The order shall protect the safety and well-being of the
plaintiff and minor children and shall specify the place and frequency of
parenting time. Parenting time arrangements shall not compromise any other
remedy provided by the court by requiring or encouraging contact between the
plaintiff and defendant.  Orders for parenting time may include a designation
of a place of parenting time away from the plaintiff, the participation of a
third party, or supervised parenting time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   The court shall consider
a request by a custodial parent who has been subjected to domestic violence by
a person with parenting time rights to a child in the parent's custody for an
investigation or evaluation by the appropriate agency to assess the risk of
harm to the child prior to the entry of a parenting time order.  Any denial of
such a request must be on the record and shall only be made if the judge finds
the request to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   The court shall consider
suspension of the parenting time order and hold an emergency hearing upon an
application made by the plaintiff certifying under oath that the defendant's
access to the child pursuant to the parenting time order has threatened the
safety and well-being of the child.</p>

Compensation Office for any and all compensation paid by the Victims of Crime
Compensation Office directly to or on behalf of the victim, and may require
that the defendant reimburse any parties that may have compensated the victim,
as the court may determine. Compensatory losses shall include, but not be
limited to, loss of earnings or other support, including child or spousal
support, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained, cost of repair or
replacement of real or personal property damaged or destroyed or taken by the
defendant, cost of counseling for the victim, moving or other travel expenses,
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and compensation for pain and
suffering. Where appropriate, punitive damages may be awarded in addition to
compensatory damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   An order requiring the
defendant to receive professional domestic violence counseling from either a
private source or a source appointed by the court and, in that event, requiring
the defendant to provide the court at specified intervals with documentation of
attendance at the professional counseling.  The court may order the defendant
to pay for the professional counseling.  No application by the defendant to
dissolve a final order which contains a requirement for attendance at
professional counseling pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted by the
court unless, in addition to any other provisions required by law or conditions
ordered by the court, the defendant has completed all required attendance at
such counseling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   An order restraining the
defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment
of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and
requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in

household members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   An order restraining the
defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order
forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any

members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom
communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   An order requiring that
the defendant make or continue to make rent or mortgage payments on the
residence occupied by the victim if the defendant is found to have a duty to
support the victim or other dependent household members; provided that this
issue has not been resolved or is not being litigated between the parties in
another action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   An order granting either
party temporary possession of specified personal property, such as an

emergency monetary relief, including emergency support for minor children, to
the victim and other dependents, if any.  An ongoing obligation of support
shall be determined at a later date pursuant to applicable law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)    An order awarding

parent.</p>

that a law enforcement officer accompany either party to the residence or any
shared business premises to supervise the removal of personal belongings in
order to ensure the personal safety of the plaintiff when a restraining order

P.L.1995, c.242).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14)    An order granting any
other appropriate relief for the plaintiff and dependent children, provided
that the plaintiff consents to such relief, including relief requested by the

relief at the time of the granting of the initial emergency order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (15)    An order that requires
that the defendant report to the intake unit of the Family Part of the Chancery
Division of the Superior Court for monitoring of any other provision of the

order required by this subsection prohibiting the defendant from possessing any
firearm, the court may also issue an order prohibiting the defendant from

to follow, the complainant or any other person named in the order in a manner
that, taken in the context of past actions of the defendant, would put the
complainant in reasonable fear that the defendant would cause the death or
injury of the complainant or any other person.  Behavior prohibited under this
act includes, but is not limited to, behavior prohibited under the provisions

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   An automated monitoring
system that can be used to permit law enforcement agencies to compare the

whether the subject was in the proximity of such reported crime incidents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The Administrative
Office of the Courts shall develop procedures to determine, investigate, and
report on a 24 hours per day basis a monitored subjects noncompliance with the

any provision of law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the director,
Attorney General, Superintendent of State Police and county and municipal law

authority of the court to order electronic monitoring of a defendant found
guilty of a crime or offense involving domestic violence when a condition of

The bill would further authorize the court to order electronic monitoring for a
defendant following the issuance of a final restraining order issued pursuant
