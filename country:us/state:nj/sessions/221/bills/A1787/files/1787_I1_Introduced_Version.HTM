prior approval of the Attorney General, could file objections against the
potential resentencing of any inmate appearing on the list.  Any such objection
would have to be filed in Superior Court in the county in which the conviction
occurred, no later than 60 days following receipt of the list from the
commissioner, or within 30 days of providing notice to the Administrative
Office of the Courts and Department of Corrections of an initial determination
to file an objection, whichever date was later.  </span></p>

determination to file an objection against an inmates resentencing, the
department would be required to promptly notify the inmate and the inmates
attorney, or the Public Defender if an inmate did not have an attorney.  The
Public Defender would be required to represent any inmate concerning an
objection to resentencing if that inmate was not represented by an attorney. 
If, after making an initial determination to file an objection, no such
objection is filed against an inmate, a court could proceed with resentencing
that inmate without conducting a hearing.</span></p>

ordered, even when objected to, unless the court finds by clear and convincing
evidence after holding a hearing that <i>rescinding</i> a term of parole
eligibility previously imposed would likely pose a substantial risk to public
safety, or that the aggravating factors associated with <i>rescinding or reducing</i>,
as the case may be, a term of parole ineligibility substantially outweigh the
mitigating factors of doing so.</span></p>

ineligibility is rescinded, the court would modify the original sentence to
impose a period of discretionary parole ineligibility.  For inmates whose fixed
minimum terms of imprisonment were reduced from 85 percent of the sentence
imposed to 50 percent of that sentence, the court would add an additional
period of discretionary parole ineligibility.  Any such period of parole
ineligibility imposed pursuant to the bills resentencing procedures could not
result in a period of parole ineligibility in excess of the period that
otherwise would have been imposed under an inmates original sentence.           </span></p>

of Corrections data infrastructure, the bill would require the Commissioner of
Corrections to submit a report on this study to the Governor and Legislature

recommendations for additional funding found necessary for the department to
invest in upgrades to its data infrastructure to improve the collection,
