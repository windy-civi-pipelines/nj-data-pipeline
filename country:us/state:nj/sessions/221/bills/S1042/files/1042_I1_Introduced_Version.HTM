<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
substances, supplementing Title 13 of the Revised Statutes, and making an
appropriation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  This act shall be known
and may be cited as the Protecting Against Forever Chemicals Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  The Legislature finds and
declares:  that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, are
man-made chemical compounds that have multiple fluorine atoms bonded to a chain
of carbon atoms; that there are several thousand different types of PFAS, and
new types are invented on a nearly daily basis; that since the 1930s, PFAS have
been widely used in countless consumer products because they repel oil, water,
and grease; and that PFAS continue to be used across a variety of industries
for a variety of purposes and are ultimately contained in many of the products
sold in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares:  that the carbon-fluorine bond used to make PFAS is one of the
strongest chemical bonds and does not break down under typical environmental
conditions; that PFAS are nicknamed forever chemicals because they accumulate
in the environment, rather than break down, over time; that PFAS enters the
environment through manufacturing processes and waste streams, and humans are
exposed through contaminated food, dust, air, drinking water, and certain
consumer products; that human exposure to these chemicals has been linked to
endocrine disruption, cancer, immuno-toxicity, and developmental impacts; and
that PFAS have been detected in the blood serum of 98 percent of humans tested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature further finds
and declares:  that contamination of air, soil, and water in the State from
PFAS poses a significant threat to the environment of the State and to the
health of its citizens; that the full extent of PFAS contamination in the State
is not presently known, but is anticipated to be widespread and to require a
significant expenditure of resources to identify and remediate; and that, to
address the imminent threat of further contamination of air, soil, and water in
the State and protect the public health of citizens in the State, it is
imperative to conduct PFAS-related research within the State and to phase out
the sale of certain nonessential products containing PFAS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature therefore
determines that it is in the best interest of the residents of New Jersey for
PFAS to be prohibited from being intentionally added to certain products being
manufactured and sold within the State, for manufacturers of cookware products
containing PFAS to notify consumers about the presence of PFAS in their
products, and for educational programming and research concerning PFAS to be
available to residents in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>
