MURPHY District 7 (Burlington) SYNOPSIS Urges Congress to add Ireland to nonimmigrant visa program. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution urging Congress to pass legislation to add Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program. Whereas, The United States and Ireland share a long history that underpins a critical and special relationship; and Whereas, Irish immigrants and their descendants, through their grit, determination, and work ethic, have been a driving force of development and prosperity in the United State since our nations founding; and Whereas, Irish immigrants have made incalculable contributions in the fields of art, music, literature, religion, and organized labor in the United States; and Whereas, New generations of Irish men and women continue to contribute greatly to the growth and economic development of our nation and our State; and Whereas, Irish men and women continue to seek opportunities in the United States through all available legal channels; and Whereas, The E-3 nonimmigrant visa program allows for the expedited entry of highly skilled workers to live and work in the United States; and Whereas, E-3 visa recipients provide highly advanced practical and theoretical knowledge to specialty occupations with vacancies in the United States for up to two years; and Whereas, Nearly half of E-3 visas go unused each year because the visa program is only available to Australian nationals; and Whereas, The United States is currently experiencing a historically tight labor market, leaving highly specialized occupations without qualified applicants to fill the vacancies; and Whereas, Failure to maximize the E-3 visa program at this time leaves additional job vacancies and untapped potential in the development of our nation and our States workforce; and Whereas, Potential legislation in the United States Congress would allow for Irish nationals to apply for unused E-3 visas each year; and Whereas, Highly skilled Irish immigrants would eagerly make use of the excess number of E-3 visas, given their long history of immigrant success in the United States; and Whereas, The nation of Ireland has already expressed its intentions to reciprocate the passage of the suggested legislation with enhanced visa opportunities for American workers in Ireland; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.    The Legislature of the State of New Jersey urges the United States Congress to pass legislation to add Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly or the Secretary of the Senate to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives, and each member of the Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution urges the United States Congress to add Ireland to the E-3 nonimmigrant visa program. The E-3 nonimmigrant visa program currently allows highly skilled Australian nationals expedited entry to live and work in the United States.  E-3 visa recipients bring highly advanced and specialized knowledge to specialty occupations which otherwise would remain vacant in the United States.  The program allocates a total of 10,500 visas to be awarded each year, but half of these visas go unused on an annual basis.  Potential legislation in the United States Congress would allow for any unused visas to be awarded to Irish nationals who could fill current vacancies in a historically tight American labor market. Irish immigrants have long contributed to growth and development of the United States and the State of New Jersey in particular.  The passage of the suggested legislation would further strengthen the special bond that exists between the United States and Ireland, and provide for greater workforce development at the state and national levels.
