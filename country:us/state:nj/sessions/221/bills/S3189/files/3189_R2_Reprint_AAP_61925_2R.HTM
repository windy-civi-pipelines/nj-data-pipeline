to P.L.1995, c.137 (C.34:1B-7.37 et seq.), a corporation business tax benefit
certificate transfer program to allow new or expanding emerging technology and

is transferred and subsequently multiplied by the corporation business tax rate
provided pursuant to subsection (c) of section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162

with more than $250,000 of transferable tax benefits shall be authorized to

transferable tax benefits determined by multiplying the applicant's
transferable tax benefits less the minimum transferable tax benefits that
company is authorized to surrender under paragraph (2) of this subsection by a

benefits that the authority is authorized to approve less the total amount of
transferable tax benefits approved under paragraphs (1), (2), and (5) of this
subsection and the denominator of which is the total amount of transferable tax

year, $15,000,000 shall be allocated for the surrender of transferable tax
benefits exclusively by new and expanding emerging technology and biotechnology
companies that operate within the boundaries of the innovation zones or
opportunity zones, or for new and expanding emerging technology and
biotechnology companies that are certified as a woman- or minority-owned
business at the time of program application, except that any portion of the
$15,000,000 that is not so approved shall be available for that State fiscal
year for the surrender of transferable tax benefits by new and expanding

operating losses and research and development tax credits that the applicant
