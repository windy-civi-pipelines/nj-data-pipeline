<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    N.J.S.2C:51-2 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2C:51-2.     Forfeiture of
Public Office, Position, or Employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     A person holding any
public office, position, or employment, elective or appointive, under the
government of this State or any agency or political subdivision thereof, who is
convicted of an offense shall forfeit such office, position or employment if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   He is convicted under
the laws of this State of an offense involving dishonesty or of a crime of the
third degree or above or under the laws of another state or of the United
States of an offense or a crime which, if committed in this State, would be such
an offense or crime;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   He is convicted of an
offense involving or touching such office, position or employment; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The Constitution so
provides.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in this subsection,
&quot;involving or touching such office, position or employment&quot; means
that the offense was related directly to the person's performance in, or
circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment
held by the person. <u>In determining whether the offense was so related, the
court shall assess the identity of the victim, and shall assess the qualifications
required of the specific public office, position or employment.  The court may
make a determination that an offense was related directly to the person's
performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office,
position or employment held by the person notwithstanding the fact that the
offense did not take place during employment hours or on employment grounds</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      b.   A court of this State
shall enter an order of forfeiture pursuant to subsection a.:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Immediately upon a
finding of guilt by the trier of fact or a plea of guilty entered in any court
of this State unless the court, for good cause shown, orders a stay of such
forfeiture pending a hearing on the merits at the time of sentencing; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon application of the
county prosecutor or the Attorney General, when the forfeiture is based upon a
conviction of an offense under the laws of another state or of the United States.  An order of forfeiture pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to have
taken effect on the date the person was found guilty by the trier of fact or
pled guilty to the offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     No court shall grant a
stay of an order of forfeiture pending appeal of a conviction or forfeiture
order unless the court is clearly convinced that there is a substantial
likelihood of success on the merits.  If the conviction be reversed or the
order of forfeiture be overturned, he shall be restored, if feasible, to his
office, position or employment with all the rights, emoluments and salary
thereof from the date of forfeiture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any official action taken by
the convicted person on or after the date as of which a forfeiture of the
person's office shall take effect shall, during a period of 60 days following
the date on which an order of forfeiture shall have been issued hereunder, be
voidable by the person's successor in office or, if the office of the person
was that of member of the governing body of a county, municipality or
independent authority, by that governing body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In addition to the
punishment prescribed for the offense, and the forfeiture set forth in
subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:51-2, any person convicted of an offense involving or
touching on his public office, position or employment shall be forever
disqualified from holding any office or position of honor, trust or profit
under this State or any of its administrative or political subdivisions.  As
used in this subsection, &quot;involving or touching on his public office,
position or employment&quot; means that the offense was related directly to the
person's performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public
office, position or employment held by the person. <u>In determining whether
the offense was so related, the court shall assess the gravity of the offense
as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim, and
shall assess the qualifications required of the specific public office,
position or employment.  The court may make a determination that an offense was
related directly to the person's performance in, or circumstances flowing from,
the specific public office, position or employment held by the person
notwithstanding the fact that the offense did not take place during employment
hours or on employment grounds</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Any forfeiture or
disqualification under subsection a., b. or d. which is based upon a conviction
of a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense may be waived by
the court upon application of the county prosecutor or the Attorney General and
for good cause shown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Except as may otherwise
be ordered by the Attorney General as the public need may require, any person
convicted of an offense under section 97 of P.L.1999, c.440 (C.2C:21-34),
N.J.S.2C:27-2, N.J.S.2C:27-3, N.J.S.2C:27-5, section 100 of P.L.1999, c. 440
(C.2C:27-9), section 5 of P.L.2003, c.255 (C.2C:27-10), section 6 of P.L.2003,
c.255 (C.2C:27-11), N.J.S.2C:29-4, N.J.S.2C:30-2, or N.J.S.2C:30-3 of this
Title shall be ineligible, either directly or indirectly, to submit a bid,
enter into any contract, or to conduct any business with any board, agency,
authority, department, commission, public corporation, or other body of this
State, of this or one or more other states, or of one or more political
subdivisions of this State for a period of, but not more than, 10 years from
the date of conviction for a crime of the second degree, or five years from the
date of conviction for a crime of the third degree.  It is the purpose of this
subsection to bar any individual convicted of any of the above enumerated
offenses and any business, including any corporation, partnership, association
or proprietorship in which such individual is a principal, or with respect to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    In any case in which the
issue of forfeiture is not raised in a court of this State at the time of a
finding of guilt, entry of guilty plea or sentencing, a forfeiture of public
office, position or employment required by this section may be ordered by a
court of this State upon application of the county prosecutor or the Attorney
General or upon application of the public officer or public entity having
authority to remove the person convicted from his public office, position or
employment.  The fact that a court has declined to order forfeiture shall not preclude
the public officer or public entity having authority to remove the person
convicted from seeking to remove or suspend the person from his office,
position or employment on the ground that the conduct giving rise to the
conviction demonstrates that the person is unfit to hold the office, position
or employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require that
persons convicted of certain offenses must forfeit their public office,
position or employment.  These persons would also be permanently barred from
holding public office, position or employment in the future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, set out in
N.J.S.2C:51-2, a person must forfeit his public office, position or employment
and be barred from holding any future office or position of honor, trust or
profit under this State or any of its administrative or political subdivisions
if, among other grounds, he is convicted of an offense involving or touching on
the office, position or employment.  The statute provides that the phrase
involving or touching on his public office, position or employment means that
the offense was related directly to the person's performance in, or
circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment
held by the person.  This definition was added to the statute by P.L.2007,
c.49, which increased the penalties for public corruption crimes.  As noted in
that bill statement, the definition was in accordance with a ruling by the New
Jersey Supreme Court, <u>McCann</u> v. <u>Clerk of the City of Jersey City</u>,
167 N.J. 311 (2001), that interpreted the involving or touching language in
N.J.S.2C:51-2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     However, it is the view of the
sponsor that the definition in <u>McCann</u> and in the 2007 enactment is not
expansive enough and does not encompass certain situations where public
employees abuse of the public trust should warrant their dismissal from
employment.  For example, in <u>State</u> v. <u>Hupka</u>, 203 <u>N.J.</u> 222
(2010), the New Jersey Supreme Court held that forfeiture of office and
disqualification from future public employment were not warranted in a case
where a sheriffs officer, who also worked part-time as a police officer, pled
guilty to criminal sexual contact, a crime of the fourth degree.  He had
originally been indicted for aggravated sexual assault, a crime of the first
degree, and sexual assault, a crime of the second degree, after a female friend
alleged that he had sexually assaulted her in her apartment.  (A crime of the
fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months or a
fine of up to $10,000, or both; a crime of the second degree, by a term of five
to 10 years or a fine of up to $150,000, or both; and a crime of the first
degree, by a term of 10 to 20 years or a fine of up to $200,000 or both.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In a 3-2 decision, the Supreme
Court held that Mr. Hupkas conviction was not sufficiently related to his
position as a law enforcement officer to trigger the forfeiture and
disqualification provisions of the statute, because he was off-duty at the time
of the incident, in a private home with a person that he knew.  In a dissenting
opinion, Chief Justice Rabner wrote that, in his view, Mr. Hupkas actions did
warrant forfeiture and disqualification, as they directly related to his
performance as a law enforcement official.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Chief Justice wrote that
the decision in an older Supreme Court case, <u>Moore</u> v. <u>Youth
Correctional Institute</u>, 119 <u>N.J.</u> 256 (1990), set out the appropriate
standards for review.  In that decision, the court held that in determining
whether an offense involves and touches on employment, there is a need to
assess the gravity of the crime as revealed by its nature, its context, and the
identity of the victim  [and] .  to assess the qualifications required of the
employees public employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would add the
language in <u>Moore</u> to the provisions of N.J.S.2C:51-2.  Under the bill,
the involving or touching on his public office, position or employment
definition would include the following new language: In determining whether
the offense was so related, the court shall assess the gravity of the offense
as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim, and
shall assess the qualifications required of the specific public office,
position or employment.  In addition, the bill specifies that the court may
make a determination that an offense was related directly to the person's
performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office,
position or employment held by the person notwithstanding the fact that the
offense did not take place during employment hours or on employment grounds. </p>
