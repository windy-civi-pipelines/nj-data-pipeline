STATEMENT This bill concerns the regulation of automated systems and artificial intelligence used by State agencies. The bill establishes the position of the Artificial Intelligence Officer, who would be appointed by the Chief Technology Officer, and is required to have extensive knowledge on automated systems and artificial intelligence.  Under the bill, the Artificial Intelligence Officer is required to develop, and update every two years, procedures regulating the use of automated systems by State agency making critical decisions, which procedures would distributed to all State agencies and posted on the Office of Information Technologys Internet website.  Thereafter, each State agency would be required to comply with the automated system procedures developed by the Artificial Intelligence Officer.  The Artificial Intelligence Officer is also required to organize the inventories of automated systems, submitted by each State agency, and publish the inventories on the Office of Informations Internet website. This bill also establishes the New Jersey Artificial Intelligence Advisory Board (board) within the Legislative Branch, which board would consist of 10 voting members and eight non-voting members, and would include two co-chairs, one selected by the Speaker of the General Assembly and one selected by the President of the Senate.  Notably, the bill requires the board to take certain actions concerning the development of the automated systems procedures by the Artificial Intelligence Officer.  Specifically, the bill requires the Artificial Intelligence Officer to submit a copy of preliminary procedures to the board, requires the board to hold a public hearing on the preliminary procedures, and requires the board to submit suggested revisions to the preliminary procedures to the Artificial Intelligence Officer for final adoption.  The bill also requires the board to advise State agencies on artificial intelligence and automated systems policies, issue reports and recommendations to the Legislature on matters concerning artificial intelligence and automated systems by State agencies, request any State agency to appear before the board at the request of at least two members of the board, and create by-laws to govern the board. Additionally, this bill establishes the position of Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer, who would be appointed by the Chief Technology Officer.  Under the bill, beginning two years after the bills effective date, before a State agency is permitted to develop, utilize, or procure a new automated system, the State agency would be required to submit the proposed automated system to the Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer, who would approve or deny the proposed automated system based on whether the proposed system satisfies the requirements of the automated system procedures.  Under this bill, the Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer may periodically reevaluate the automated systems to ensure the system complies with the automated system procedures and is required to reevaluate the automated systems of State agencies at least biennially if, in the officers discretion, there is a determination that the automated system poses any significant risk. Both officers and the board would be subject to the open public records act.  Nothing in this bill should be construed to require the disclosure of a trade secret, abrogate any work product protection or restrict either officer, the board, or any State agencys ability to conduct any internal research to develop, improve, or repair any product, service, or technology, prevent, detect, protect against or respond to, or investigate, report, or prosecute any person responsible for, any security incident, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activity or illegal activity, or preserve the integrity or security of any system. This bill also creates a task force to study artificial intelligence and create an artificial intelligence bill of rights.  The task force is to consist of 11 members and is required to submit a report on its findings to the Governor and the Legislature within one year of the bills effective date.

STATEMENT This bill concerns the regulation of automated systems and artificial intelligence used by State agencies. The bill establishes the position of the Artificial Intelligence Officer, who would be appointed by the Chief Technology Officer, and is required to have extensive knowledge on automated systems and artificial intelligence.  Under the bill, the Artificial Intelligence Officer is required to develop, and update every two years, procedures regulating the use of automated systems by State agency making critical decisions, which procedures would distributed to all State agencies and posted on the Office of Information Technologys Internet website.  Thereafter, each State agency would be required to comply with the automated system procedures developed by the Artificial Intelligence Officer.  The Artificial Intelligence Officer is also required to organize the inventories of automated systems, submitted by each State agency, and publish the inventories on the Office of Informations Internet website. This bill also establishes the New Jersey Artificial Intelligence Advisory Board (board) within the Legislative Branch, which board would consist of 10 voting members and eight non-voting members, and would include two co-chairs, one selected by the Speaker of the General Assembly and one selected by the President of the Senate.  Notably, the bill requires the board to take certain actions concerning the development of the automated systems procedures by the Artificial Intelligence Officer.  Specifically, the bill requires the Artificial Intelligence Officer to submit a copy of preliminary procedures to the board, requires the board to hold a public hearing on the preliminary procedures, and requires the board to submit suggested revisions to the preliminary procedures to the Artificial Intelligence Officer for final adoption.  The bill also requires the board to advise State agencies on artificial intelligence and automated systems policies, issue reports and recommendations to the Legislature on matters concerning artificial intelligence and automated systems by State agencies, request any State agency to appear before the board at the request of at least two members of the board, and create by-laws to govern the board. Additionally, this bill establishes the position of Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer, who would be appointed by the Chief Technology Officer.  Under the bill, beginning two years after the bills effective date, before a State agency is permitted to develop, utilize, or procure a new automated system, the State agency would be required to submit the proposed automated system to the Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer, who would approve or deny the proposed automated system based on whether the proposed system satisfies the requirements of the automated system procedures.  Under this bill, the Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer may periodically reevaluate the automated systems to ensure the system complies with the automated system procedures and is required to reevaluate the automated systems of State agencies at least biennially if, in the officers discretion, there is a determination that the automated system poses any significant risk. Both officers and the board would be subject to the open public records act.  Nothing in this bill should be construed to require the disclosure of a trade secret, abrogate any work product protection or restrict either officer, the board, or any State agencys ability to conduct any internal research to develop, improve, or repair any product, service, or technology, prevent, detect, protect against or respond to, or investigate, report, or prosecute any person responsible for, any security incident, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activity or illegal activity, or preserve the integrity or security of any system. This bill also creates a task force to study artificial intelligence and create an artificial intelligence bill of rights.  The task force is to consist of 11 members and is required to submit a report on its findings to the Governor and the Legislature within one year of the bills effective date.
