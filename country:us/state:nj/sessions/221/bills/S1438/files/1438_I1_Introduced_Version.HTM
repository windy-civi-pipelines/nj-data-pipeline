<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill concerns the
regulation of automated systems and artificial intelligence used by State
agencies.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes the
position of the Artificial Intelligence Officer, who would be appointed by the
Chief Technology Officer, and is required to have extensive knowledge on
automated systems and artificial intelligence.  Under the bill, the Artificial
Intelligence Officer is required to develop, and update every two years, procedures
regulating the use of automated systems by State agency making critical
decisions, which procedures would distributed to all State agencies and posted
on the Office of Information Technologys Internet website.  Thereafter, each
State agency would be required to comply with the automated system procedures
developed by the Artificial Intelligence Officer.  The Artificial Intelligence
Officer is also required to organize the inventories of automated systems,
submitted by each State agency, and publish the inventories on the Office of
Informations Internet website. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also establishes the
New Jersey Artificial Intelligence Advisory Board (board) within the
Legislative Branch, which board would consist of 10 voting members and eight
non-voting members, and would include two co-chairs, one selected by the
Speaker of the General Assembly and one selected by the President of the
Senate.  Notably, the bill requires the board to take certain actions
concerning the development of the automated systems procedures by the
Artificial Intelligence Officer.  Specifically, the bill requires the
Artificial Intelligence Officer to submit a copy of preliminary procedures to
the board, requires the board to hold a public hearing on the preliminary
procedures, and requires the board to submit suggested revisions to the
preliminary procedures to the Artificial Intelligence Officer for final
adoption.  The bill also requires the board to advise State agencies on
artificial intelligence and automated systems policies, issue reports and
recommendations to the Legislature on matters concerning artificial
intelligence and automated systems by State agencies, request any State agency
to appear before the board at the request of at least two members of the board,
and create by-laws to govern the board.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, this bill
establishes the position of Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer, who
would be appointed by the Chief Technology Officer.  Under the bill, beginning
two years after the bills effective date, before a State agency is permitted
to develop, utilize, or procure a new automated system, the State agency would
be required to submit the proposed automated system to the Artificial
Intelligence Implementation Officer, who would approve or deny the proposed
automated system based on whether the proposed system satisfies the
requirements of the automated system procedures.  Under this bill, the
Artificial Intelligence Implementation Officer may periodically reevaluate the
automated systems to ensure the system complies with the automated system
procedures and is required to reevaluate the automated systems of State
agencies at least biennially if, in the officers discretion, there is a
determination that the automated system poses any significant risk.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Both officers and the board
would be subject to the open public records act.  Nothing in this bill should
be construed to require the disclosure of a trade secret, abrogate any work
product protection or restrict either officer, the board, or any State agencys
ability to conduct any internal research to develop, improve, or repair any
product, service, or technology, prevent, detect, protect against or respond
to, or investigate, report, or prosecute any person responsible for, any
security incident, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive
activity or illegal activity, or preserve the integrity or security of any
system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also creates a task
force to study artificial intelligence and create an artificial intelligence
bill of rights.  The task force is to consist of 11 members and is required to
submit a report on its findings to the Governor and the Legislature within one
year of the bills effective date.</p>
