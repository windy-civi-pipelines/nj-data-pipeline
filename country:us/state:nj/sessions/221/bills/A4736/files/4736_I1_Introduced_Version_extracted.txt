STATEMENT This bill extends the public school law on harassment, intimidation, and bullying to apply to certain acts of fraudulent impersonation or false depiction by means of artificial intelligence or deepfake technology.  The bill also extends the law to apply to acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying against teachers and staff members. Current law requires each school district to adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation, or bullying. The definition of harassment, intimidation, or bullying includes gestures and written, verbal or physical acts, and electronic communications. This bill clarifies that any act or communication, including electronic communication that uses deceptive audio or visual media may not be used to harass, intimidate, or bully a student, teacher, or staff member.  Under the bill, deceptive audio or visual media means any video recording, motion picture film, sound recording, electronic image, photograph, any technological representation of speech or conduct substantially derivative thereof, or any forgery or facsimile of a document or writing, that appears to a reasonable person to realistically depict any speech, conduct, or writing of a person who did not in fact engage in the speech, conduct, or writing, and the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally impersonate the person.

A parent or guardian, teacher, or staff member may request a hearing before the board after receiving the information, and the hearing shall be held within 10 days of the request.  The board shall meet in executive session for the hearing to protect the confidentiality of the students, teachers, or staff members.  At the hearing the board may hear from the school anti-bullying specialist about the incident, recommendations for discipline or services, and any programs instituted to reduce such incidents; (e) at the next board of education meeting following its receipt of the report pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (6) of this subsection, the board shall issue a decision, in writing, to affirm, reject, or modify the superintendent's decision.   The board's decision may be appealed to the Commissioner of Education, in accordance with the procedures set forth in law and regulation, no later than 90 days after the issuance of the board's decision; and (f) a parent, student, guardian, teacher, staff member, or organization may file a complaint with the Division on Civil Rights within 180 days of the occurrence of any incident of harassment, intimidation, or bullying based on membership in a protected group as enumerated in the "Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); (7) the range of ways in which a school will respond once an incident of harassment, intimidation or bullying is identified, which shall be defined by the principal in conjunction with the school anti-bullying specialist, but shall include an appropriate combination of services that are available within the district such as counseling, support services, intervention services, and other programs, as defined by the commissioner.  In the event that the necessary programs and services are not available within the district, the district may apply to the Department of Education for a grant from the "Bullying Prevention Fund" established pursuant to section 25 of P.L.2010, c.122 (C.18A:37-28) to support the provision of out-of-district programs and services; (8) a statement that prohibits reprisal or retaliation against any person who reports an act of harassment, intimidation or bullying and the consequence and appropriate remedial action for a person who engages in reprisal or retaliation; (9) consequences and appropriate remedial action for a person found to have falsely accused another as a means of retaliation or as a means of harassment, intimidation or bullying; (10) a statement of how the policy is to be publicized, including notice that the policy applies to participation in school-sponsored functions; (11) a requirement that a link to the policy be prominently posted on the home page of the school district's website and distributed annually to parents and guardians who have children enrolled in a school in the school district; (12) a requirement that the name, school phone number, school address and school email address of the district anti-bullying coordinator be listed on the home page of the school district's website and that on the home page of each school's website the name, school phone number, school address and school email address of the school anti-bullying specialist and the district anti-bullying coordinator be listed.

STATEMENT This bill extends the public school law on harassment, intimidation, and bullying to apply to certain acts of fraudulent impersonation or false depiction by means of artificial intelligence or deepfake technology.  The bill also extends the law to apply to acts of harassment, intimidation, or bullying against teachers and staff members. Current law requires each school district to adopt a policy prohibiting harassment, intimidation, or bullying. The definition of harassment, intimidation, or bullying includes gestures and written, verbal or physical acts, and electronic communications. This bill clarifies that any act or communication, including electronic communication that uses deceptive audio or visual media may not be used to harass, intimidate, or bully a student, teacher, or staff member.  Under the bill, deceptive audio or visual media means any video recording, motion picture film, sound recording, electronic image, photograph, any technological representation of speech or conduct substantially derivative thereof, or any forgery or facsimile of a document or writing, that appears to a reasonable person to realistically depict any speech, conduct, or writing of a person who did not in fact engage in the speech, conduct, or writing, and the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally impersonate the person.
