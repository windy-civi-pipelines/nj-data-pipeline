<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.1945,
c.162 (C.54:10A-4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    For the purposes of this
act, unless the context requires a different meaning:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   &quot;Commissioner&quot;
or &quot;director&quot; shall mean the Director of the Division of Taxation of
the State Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   &quot;Allocation
factor&quot; shall mean the proportionate part of a taxpayer's net worth or
entire net income used to determine a measure of its tax under this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   &quot;Corporation&quot;
shall mean any corporation, joint-stock company or association and any business
conducted by a trustee or trustees wherein interest or ownership is evidenced
by a certificate of interest or ownership or similar written instrument, any
other entity classified as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, and any
state or federally chartered building and loan association or savings and loan
association.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   &quot;Net worth&quot;
shall mean the aggregate of the values disclosed by the books of the
corporation for (1) issued and outstanding capital stock, (2) paid-in or capital
surplus, (3) earned surplus and undivided profits, and (4) surplus reserves
which can reasonably be expected to accrue to holders or owners of equitable
shares, not including reasonable valuation reserves, such as reserves for
depreciation or obsolescence or depletion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, net
worth shall not include any deduction for the amount of the excess depreciation
described in paragraph (2) (F) of subsection (k) of this section.  The
foregoing aggregate of values shall be reduced by 50% of the amount disclosed
by the books of the corporation for investment in the capital stock of one or
more subsidiaries, which investment is defined as ownership (1) of at least 80%
of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the subsidiary
entitled to vote and (2) of at least 80% of the total number of shares of all
other classes of stock except nonvoting stock which is limited and preferred as
to dividends. In the case of investment in an entity organized under the laws
of a foreign country, the foregoing requisite degree of ownership shall effect
a like reduction of such investment from the net worth of the taxpayer, if the
foreign entity is considered a corporation for any purpose under the United
States federal income tax laws, such as (but not by way of sole examples) for
the purpose of supplying deemed paid foreign tax credits or for the purpose of
status as a controlled foreign corporation.  In calculating the net worth of a
taxpayer entitled to reduction for investment in subsidiaries, the amount of
liabilities of the taxpayer shall be reduced by such proportion of the
liabilities as corresponds to the ratio which the excluded portion of the
subsidiary values bears to the total assets of the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the case of banking corporations
which have international banking facilities as defined in subsection (n), the
foregoing aggregate of values shall also be reduced by retained earnings of the
international banking facility.  Retained earnings means the earnings
accumulated over the life of such facility and shall not include the
distributive share of dividends paid and federal income taxes paid or payable
during the tax year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If in the opinion of the
director, the corporation's books do not disclose fair valuations the director may
make a reasonable determination of the net worth which, in his opinion, would
reflect the fair value of the assets, exclusive of subsidiary investments as
defined aforesaid, carried on the books of the corporation, in accordance with
sound accounting principles, and such determination shall be used as net worth
for the purpose of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1998, c.114.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   &quot;Investment
company&quot; shall mean any corporation whose business during the period
covered by its report consisted, to the extent of at least 90% thereof of
holding, investing and reinvesting in stocks, bonds, notes, mortgages,
debentures, patents, patent rights and other securities for its own account,
but this shall not include any corporation which: (1) is a merchant or a dealer
of stocks, bonds and other securities, regularly engaged in buying the same and
selling the same to customers; or (2) had less than 90% of its average gross
assets in New Jersey, at cost, invested in stocks, bonds, debentures,
mortgages, notes, patents, patent rights or other securities or consisting of
cash on deposit during the period covered by its report; or (3) is a banking
corporation, a savings institution, or a financial business corporation as
defined in the Corporation Business Tax Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   &quot;Regulated
investment company&quot; shall mean any corporation which for a period covered
by its report, is registered and regulated under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (54 Stat. 789), as amended.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   &quot;Taxpayer&quot;
shall mean any corporation, any combined group filing a mandatory or elective
New Jersey combined return, and any partnership required, or consenting, to
report or to pay taxes, interest or penalties under this act.
&quot;Taxpayer&quot; shall not include a partnership that is listed on a United
States national stock exchange. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    &quot;Fiscal year&quot;
shall mean an accounting period ending on any day other than the last day of
December on the basis of which the taxpayer is required to report for federal
income tax purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (j)    Except as herein
provided, &quot;privilege period&quot; shall mean the calendar or fiscal
accounting period for which a tax is payable under this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (k)   &quot;Entire net
income&quot; shall mean total net income from all sources, whether within or
without the United States, and shall include the gain derived from the
employment of capital or labor, or from both combined, as well as profit gained
through a sale or conversion of capital assets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purpose of this act,
the amount of a taxpayer's entire net income shall be deemed prima facie to be
equal in amount to the taxable income, before net operating loss deduction and
special deductions, which the taxpayer is required to report, or, if the

otherwise calculated by 50%.  If and only to the extent that any net operating
loss carryover deduction is disallowed by reason of this subparagraph (E), the
date on which the amount of the disallowed net operating loss carryover

subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 108

shall be computed using the straight line method over a thirty-year life. A

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (gg) &quot;Unitary
business&quot; means a single economic enterprise that is made up either of
separate parts of a single business entity or of a group of business entities
under common ownership that are sufficiently interdependent, integrated, and
interrelated through their activities so as to provide a synergy and mutual
benefit that produces a sharing or exchange of value among them and a
significant flow of value among the separate parts.  &quot;Unitary
business&quot; shall be construed to the broadest extent permitted under the
Constitution of the United States.  A business conducted by a partnership which
is in a unitary business with the combined group shall be treated as the
business of the partners that are members of the combined group, whether the
partnership interest is held directly or indirectly through a series of
partnerships, to the extent of a partner's distributive share of partnership
income.  The amount of partnership income to be included in the partner's
entire net income shall be determined in accordance with subsection a. of
section 3 of P.L.2001, c.136 (C.54:10A-15.6) or subsection a. of section 4 of
P.L.2001, c.136 (C.54:10A-15.7), as applicable.  A business conducted directly
or indirectly by one corporation is unitary with that portion of a business
conducted by another corporation through its direct or indirect interest in a
partnership.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a two-year
carryback deduction for net operating losses incurred by corporation business
taxpayers.  A net operating loss carryback deduction allows corporate taxpayers
to file amended income tax returns for past tax years in which they were
profitable, use current tax year business losses to offset those profits, and
receive refunds of taxes paid in past tax years.  Along with carryforward net
operating loss deductions (which allow corporations to deduct from taxable
income in future years net operating losses sustained in preceding tax years),
carryback net operating loss deductions enable businesses to average their
income over a time period that more closely corresponds to their investment
horizon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The federal government and 17
states authorize businesses to carry back and forward net operating losses. 
The standard federal carryback period and that of most states is two years.  New
  Jersey, on the other hand, only allows for a 20-year carryforward of net
operating losses.  The inclusion of a carryback provision in its corporation
business tax code would make New Jersey not just more competitive relative to
other states, but it would also counteract the growth-stunting perception
within the business community that the State is more interested in penalizing and
thwarting than in rewarding and encouraging the creation and growth of
businesses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Even though the enactment of
this legislation would not turn New Jersey into the state with the
business-friendliest system of taxation, it would nonetheless make New Jersey
more welcoming to businesses and thus encourage them to invest and create
employment in the Garden State.  </p>
