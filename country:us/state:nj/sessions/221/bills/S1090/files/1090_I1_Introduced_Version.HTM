For the purposes of this section, the court may deem procedural due process requirements for notice and service of process to be met with respect to a party thereto upon delivery of written notice to the most recent residential or employer address filed with the Probation Division for that party.  If a party fails to respond to a notice and no proof is available that the party received the notice, the Probation Division shall document to the court that it has made a diligent effort to locate the party by making inquiries that may include, but are not limited to: the United States Postal Service, the Division of Motor Vehicles in the Department of Transportation, the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury and the Departments of Labor and Corrections.  The Probation Division shall provide an affidavit to the court presenting such documentation of its diligent effort, which certifies its inability to locate the party, before any adverse action is taken based upon the party's failure to respond to the notice. c.     If the obligor requests a hearing, the Probation Division shall file a petition for a judicial hearing in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1996, c.7 (C.2A:17-56.43).  The hearing shall occur within 45 days of the obligor's request.  If, at or prior to the hearing, the obligor pays the full amount of the child support arrearage or provides health care coverage as ordered, or responds to the subpoena or surrenders to the county sheriff or the Probation Division, the license revocation process shall be terminated.  No license revocation action shall be initiated if the Probation Division has received notice that the obligor has pending a motion to modify the child support order if that motion was filed prior to the date that the notice of the license suspension or revocation was sent by the Probation Division. The court shall consider the Probation Division's petition to revoke or suspend a license in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1996, c.7 (C.2A:17-56.43).

No offense shall be considered for billing in more than three annual assessments. (b)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1984, c.1.) (2)   (a)   Surcharges shall be levied pursuant to subsection f. of section 1 of P.L.2000, c.75 (C.39:4-97.2) for each offense of unsafe driving under subsection a. of that section. (b)   Surcharges shall be levied for convictions (i) under R.S.39:4-50 for violations occurring on or after February 10, 1983, and (ii) under section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a), or for offenses committed in other jurisdictions of a substantially similar nature to those under R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a), for violations occurring on or after January 26, 1984.  Except as hereinafter provided, surcharges under this subparagraph (b) shall be levied annually for a three-year period, and shall be [$1,000.00] $1,000 per year for each of the first two convictions, for a total surcharge of $3,000 for each conviction, and [$1,500.00] $1,500 per year for the third conviction occurring within a three-year period, for a total surcharge of $4,500 for the third conviction.  If a driver is convicted under both R.S.39:4-50 and section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) for offenses arising out of the same incident, the driver shall be assessed only one surcharge for the two offenses. [If, upon written notification from the commission or its designee, mailed to the last address of record with the commission, a driver fails to pay a surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission, the driving privilege of the driver shall be suspended forthwith until at least five percent of each outstanding surcharge assessment that has resulted in suspension is paid to the commission; except that the commission may authorize payment of the surcharge on an installment basis over a period of 12 months for assessments under $2,300 or 24 months for assessments of $2,300 or more.] The commission, for good cause, may authorize payment of any surcharge on an installment basis over a period not to exceed 36 months.  If a driver fails to pay the surcharge or any installments on the surcharge, the total surcharge shall become due immediately, except as otherwise prescribed by rule of the commission. The commission may authorize any person to pay the surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission by use of a credit card, debit card or other electronic payment device, and the administrator is authorized to require the person to pay all costs incurred by the commission in connection with the acceptance of the credit card, debit card or other electronic payment device.  If a surcharge or related administrative fee is paid by credit or debit cards or any other electronic payment device and the amount is subsequently reversed by the credit card company or bank, [the driving privilege of the surcharged driver shall be suspended and] the driver shall be subject to the fee imposed for dishonored checks pursuant to section 31 of P.L.1994, c.60 (C.39:5-36.1). In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the commission is authorized to utilize the provisions of the SOIL (Set off of Individual Liability) program established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.239 (C.54A:9-8.1 et seq.) to collect any surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission that is unpaid on or after the effective date of this act.  As an additional remedy, the commission may issue a certificate to the Clerk of the Superior Court stating that the person identified in the certificate is indebted under this surcharge law in such amount as shall be stated in the certificate.  The certificate shall reference the statute under which the indebtedness arises.  Thereupon the clerk to whom such certificate shall have been issued shall immediately enter upon the record of docketed judgments the name of such person as debtor; the State as creditor; the address of such person, if shown in the certificate; the amount of the debt so certified; a reference to the statute under which the surcharge is assessed, and the date of making such entries.  The docketing of the entries shall have the same force and effect as a civil judgment docketed in the Superior Court, and the commission shall have all the remedies and may take all of the proceedings for the collection thereof which may be had or taken upon the recovery of a judgment in an action, but without prejudice to any right of appeal.  Upon entry by the clerk of the certificate in the record of docketed judgments in accordance with this provision, interest in the amount specified by the court rules for post-judgment interest shall accrue from the date of the docketing of the certificate, however payment of the interest may be waived by the commission or its designee.  In the event that the surcharge remains unpaid following the issuance of the certificate of debt and the commission takes any further collection action including referral of the matter to the Attorney General or his designee, the fee imposed, in lieu of the actual cost of collection, may be 20 percent of surcharges of $1,000 or more.  The administrator or his designee may establish a sliding scale, not to exceed a maximum amount of $200, for surcharge principal amounts of less than $1,000 at the time the certificate of debt is forwarded to the Superior Court for filing.  The commission shall provide written notification to a driver of the proposed filing of the certificate of debt at least 10 days prior to the proposed filing; such notice shall be mailed to the driver's last address of record with the commission.  Upon the filing of a certificate of debt with the Clerk of the Superior Court, the surcharged driver shall not be eligible for the restoration of his driving privilege until at least five percent of each outstanding surcharge assessment that has resulted in the suspension, including interest and costs, if any, is paid to the commission.  If a certificate of debt is satisfied following a credit card payment, debit card payment or payment by other electronic payment device and that payment is reversed, a new certificate of debt shall be filed against the surcharged driver unless the original is reinstated. If the administrator or his designee approves a special payment plan, of such duration as the administrator or his designee deems appropriate, for repayment of the certificate of debt, and the driver is complying with the approved plan, the plan may be continued for any new surcharge not part of the certificate of debt. All moneys collectible by the commission under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. shall be billed and collected by the commission except as provided in P.L.1997, c.280 (C.2B:19-10 et al.) for the collection of unpaid surcharges.  Commencing on September 1, 1996, or such earlier time as the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall certify to the State Treasurer that amounts on deposit in the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund are sufficient to satisfy the current and anticipated financial obligations of the New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association, all surcharges collected by the commission under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. shall be remitted to the Division of Motor Vehicles Surcharge Fund: (i)    for transfer to the Market Transition Facility Revenue Fund, as provided in section 12 of P.L.1994, c.57 (C.34:1B-21.12), for the purposes of section 4 of P.L.1994, c.57 (C.34:1B-21.4) until such a time as all the Market Transition Facility bonds, notes and obligations and all Motor Vehicle Commission bonds, notes and obligations issued pursuant to that section 4 of P.L.1994, c.57 (C.34:1B-21.4) and the costs thereof are discharged and no longer outstanding; and (ii)   from and after the date of certification by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance that the moneys collectible under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. are no longer needed to fund the association or at such time as all Market Transition Facility bonds, notes and obligations and all Motor Vehicle Commission bonds, notes and obligations issued pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1994, c.57 (C.34:1B-21.4) and the costs thereof are discharged and no longer outstanding, for transfer to the Motor Vehicle Surcharges Revenue Fund established pursuant to section 6 of the "Motor Vehicle Surcharges Securitization Act of 2004," P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.28) to be applied as set forth in section 6 that act.  From and after such time as all bonds issued under section 4 of the "Motor Vehicle Surcharges Securitization Act of 2004," P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.26) and the costs thereof are discharged and no longer outstanding, all surcharges collected by the commission under subparagraph (b) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. shall, subject to appropriation, be remitted to the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association created pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1974, c.17 (C.17:30A-6) to be used for payment of any loans made by that association to the New Jersey Automobile Insurance Guaranty Fund pursuant to paragraph (10) of subsection a. of section 8 of P.L.1974, c.17 (C.17:30A-8); provided that all such payments shall be subject to and dependent upon appropriation by the State Legislature. All surcharges collected by the courts pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. shall be forwarded not less frequently than monthly to the Division of Revenue.  The Division of Revenue shall transfer: all such surcharges received prior to July 1, 2006, to the General Fund, and commencing July 1, 2006, all such surcharges to the Unsafe Driving Surcharge Revenue Fund established pursuant to section 5 of the "Motor Vehicle Surcharges Securitization Act of 2004," P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.27) to be applied as set forth in section 5 of that act.  From and after such time as all bonds (including refunding bonds), notes and other obligations issued under section 4 of the "Motor Vehicle Surcharges Securitization Act of 2004," P.L.2004, c.70 (C.34:1B-21.26), and the costs thereof are discharged and no longer outstanding, all such surcharges collected by the courts pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (2) of this subsection b. and forwarded to the Division of Revenue shall be transferred to the General Fund.

(cf: P.L.1985, c.14, s.5) 5.    Section 9 of P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.10) is amended to read as follows: 9.    a.   If a person has failed to respond to a failure to appear notice or has failed to pay a parking judgment, the municipal court may give notice of that fact to the commission in a manner prescribed by the chief administrator.  If notice has been given under this section of a person's failure to respond to a failure to appear notice or to pay a parking judgment and if the fines and penalties are paid or if the case is dismissed or otherwise disposed of, the municipal court shall promptly give notice to that effect to the commission. b.    The judge or the commission may suspend [the driver's license, or] the registration of the motor vehicle of an owner, lessee, or operator who has not answered or appeared in response to a failure to appear notice or has not paid or otherwise satisfied outstanding parking fines or penalties. If the [license or] registration suspension is the result of the failure to pay outstanding parking fines or penalties, or respond to a failure to appear notice, the commission shall: (1)   delay the imposition of the [license or] registration suspension for at least [30] 90 days after the date on which the commission received a notice of suspension from the municipal court; and (2)   upon receipt of a notice of suspension from the municipal court, provide written notice advising the owner, lessee, or operator that the suspension shall take effect [30] 90 days after the date of the commission's notice.  The written notice issued by the commission shall provide the reason for suspension, identify the municipal court that issued the notice of suspension, and inform the owner, lessee, or operator that the suspension may be avoided by contacting the municipal court that issued the notice of suspension within the [30] 90 day period to resolve the pending parking violation. If an owner, lessee or operator has been found guilty of a parking offense and has failed to pay or otherwise satisfy outstanding parking fines or penalties, the court shall provide notice and an opportunity to appear before a judge prior to suspending that person's [driver's license or] motor vehicle registration.  In determining whether to suspend the person's [driver's license or the] motor vehicle registration, the judge and the commission shall take into consideration the area where the person resides and whether or not the person has access to off-street parking.  In accordance with section 1 of P.L.1981, c.365 (C.39:4-203.1) and section 1 of P.L.2009, c.317 (C.2B:12-23.1), a court may permit alternatives to the payment of certain outstanding portions of parking fines and penalties based on a person's ability to pay, including allowing the payment of the fine in installments, conversion of the fine to community service, or revoking portions of the fine or penalty.

STATEMENT This bill eliminates mandatory drivers license suspension as a penalty for various crimes and offenses unrelated to safely operating a motor vehicle. The bill eliminates drivers license suspension as a penalty for convictions of the following crimes and offenses: -crimes for which certain fines, assessments, or restitution are imposed and the defendant is in default without good cause (suspension until past payments are made); -failure to pay motor vehicle violation surcharges (suspension until eight percent of the outstanding surcharges is paid or an installment payment plan is established); -failure to respond to a failure to appear notice or failure to pay a parking judgment (suspension until payment is satisfied); -failure to appear in municipal court (suspension until matter is adjudicated) or failure to satisfy a condition of the sentence, such as pay an assessed fine or perform community service (suspension until condition is satisfied); -failure of an indigent defendant to comply with terms of an installment payment plan for a motor vehicle traffic violation or parking offense; -defaulting on certain financial obligations to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (until repaid); and -failure to pay child support upon the issuance of a child support-related warrant.  The court retains discretion to suspend the persons drivers license if, after notice and a hearing, the court finds that suspension is warranted. The bill also prohibits the use of arrest as a penalty for unpaid parking tickets and requires the court to notify a defendant who has failed to pay outstanding parking tickets or failed to appear that the penalties for such actions include suspension of motor vehicle registration or the impoundment, immobilization, or possible sale of the persons motor vehicle.  The bill also delays the period that a municipality may impound, immobilize, or authorize the sale of a motor vehicle for unpaid parking tickets from 30 days to 90 days.

No offense shall be considered for billing in more than three annual assessments. (b)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1984, c.1.) (2)   (a)   Surcharges shall be levied pursuant to subsection f. of section 1 of P.L.2000, c.75 (C.39:4-97.2) for each offense of unsafe driving under subsection a. of that section. (b)   Surcharges shall be levied for convictions (i) under R.S.39:4-50 for violations occurring on or after February 10, 1983, and (ii) under section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a), or for offenses committed in other jurisdictions of a substantially similar nature to those under R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a), for violations occurring on or after January 26, 1984.  Except as hereinafter provided, surcharges under this subparagraph (b) shall be levied annually for a three-year period, and shall be [$1,000.00] $1,000 per year for each of the first two convictions, for a total surcharge of $3,000 for each conviction, and [$1,500.00] $1,500 per year for the third conviction occurring within a three-year period, for a total surcharge of $4,500 for the third conviction.  If a driver is convicted under both R.S.39:4-50 and section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) for offenses arising out of the same incident, the driver shall be assessed only one surcharge for the two offenses. [If, upon written notification from the commission or its designee, mailed to the last address of record with the commission, a driver fails to pay a surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission, the driving privilege of the driver shall be suspended forthwith until at least five percent of each outstanding surcharge assessment that has resulted in suspension is paid to the commission; except that the commission may authorize payment of the surcharge on an installment basis over a period of 12 months for assessments under $2,300 or 24 months for assessments of $2,300 or more.] The commission, for good cause, may authorize payment of any surcharge on an installment basis over a period not to exceed 36 months.  If a driver fails to pay the surcharge or any installments on the surcharge, the total surcharge shall become due immediately, except as otherwise prescribed by rule of the commission. The commission may authorize any person to pay the surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission by use of a credit card, debit card or other electronic payment device, and the administrator is authorized to require the person to pay all costs incurred by the commission in connection with the acceptance of the credit card, debit card or other electronic payment device.  If a surcharge or related administrative fee is paid by credit or debit cards or any other electronic payment device and the amount is subsequently reversed by the credit card company or bank, [the driving privilege of the surcharged driver shall be suspended and] the driver shall be subject to the fee imposed for dishonored checks pursuant to section 31 of P.L.1994, c.60 (C.39:5-36.1). In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the commission is authorized to utilize the provisions of the SOIL (Set off of Individual Liability) program established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.239 (C.54A:9-8.1 et seq.) to collect any surcharge levied under this section and collectible by the commission that is unpaid on or after the effective date of this act.  As an additional remedy, the commission may issue a certificate to the Clerk of the Superior Court stating that the person identified in the certificate is indebted under this surcharge law in such amount as shall be stated in the certificate.  The certificate shall reference the statute under which the indebtedness arises.  Thereupon the clerk to whom such certificate shall have been issued shall immediately enter upon the record of docketed judgments the name of such person as debtor; the State as creditor; the address of such person, if shown in the certificate; the amount of the debt so certified; a reference to the statute under which the surcharge is assessed, and the date of making such entries.  The docketing of the entries shall have the same force and effect as a civil judgment docketed in the Superior Court, and the commission shall have all the remedies and may take all of the proceedings for the collection thereof which may be had or taken upon the recovery of a judgment in an action, but without prejudice to any right of appeal.  Upon entry by the clerk of the certificate in the record of docketed judgments in accordance with this provision, interest in the amount specified by the court rules for post-judgment interest shall accrue from the date of the docketing of the certificate, however payment of the interest may be waived by the commission or its designee.  In the event that the surcharge remains unpaid following the issuance of the certificate of debt and the commission takes any further collection action including referral of the matter to the Attorney General or his designee, the fee imposed, in lieu of the actual cost of collection, may be 20 percent of surcharges of $1,000 or more.  The administrator or his designee may establish a sliding scale, not to exceed a maximum amount of $200, for surcharge principal amounts of less than $1,000 at the time the certificate of debt is forwarded to the Superior Court for filing.  The commission shall provide written notification to a driver of the proposed filing of the certificate of debt at least 10 days prior to the proposed filing; such notice shall be mailed to the driver's last address of record with the commission.  Upon the filing of a certificate of debt with the Clerk of the Superior Court, the surcharged driver shall not be eligible for the restoration of his driving privilege until at least five percent of each outstanding surcharge assessment that has resulted in the suspension, including interest and costs, if any, is paid to the commission.  If a certificate of debt is satisfied following a credit card payment, debit card payment or payment by other electronic payment device and that payment is reversed, a new certificate of debt shall be filed against the surcharged driver unless the original is reinstated. If the administrator or his designee approves a special payment plan, of such duration as the administrator or his designee deems appropriate, for repayment of the certificate of debt, and the driver is complying with the approved plan, the plan may be continued for any new surcharge not part of the certificate of debt.

If the [license or] registration suspension is the result of the failure to pay outstanding parking fines or penalties, or respond to a failure to appear notice, the commission shall: (1)   delay the imposition of the [license or] registration suspension for at least [30] 90 days after the date on which the commission received a notice of suspension from the municipal court; and (2)   upon receipt of a notice of suspension from the municipal court, provide written notice advising the owner, lessee, or operator that the suspension shall take effect [30] 90 days after the date of the commission's notice.  The written notice issued by the commission shall provide the reason for suspension, identify the municipal court that issued the notice of suspension, and inform the owner, lessee, or operator that the suspension may be avoided by contacting the municipal court that issued the notice of suspension within the [30] 90 day period to resolve the pending parking violation. If an owner, lessee or operator has been found guilty of a parking offense and has failed to pay or otherwise satisfy outstanding parking fines or penalties, the court shall provide notice and an opportunity to appear before a judge prior to suspending that person's [driver's license or] motor vehicle registration.  In determining whether to suspend the person's [driver's license or the] motor vehicle registration, the judge and the commission shall take into consideration the area where the person resides and whether or not the person has access to off-street parking.  In accordance with section 1 of P.L.1981, c.365 (C.39:4-203.1) and section 1 of P.L.2009, c.317 (C.2B:12-23.1), a court may permit alternatives to the payment of certain outstanding portions of parking fines and penalties based on a person's ability to pay, including allowing the payment of the fine in installments, conversion of the fine to community service, or revoking portions of the fine or penalty. When a person whose [license or] registration has been suspended appears at court proceedings or otherwise resolves pending parking violations, or pays or otherwise satisfies all parking fines or penalties, the municipal court shall provide the person with a receipt of payment and shall give electronic notice to the commission that the person's obligations have been satisfied and the suspension ordered by the court shall not be imposed.  If, prior to the effective date of the suspension by the commission, the person submits the receipt of payment to the commission or the commission receives the electronic notice stating that the person's obligations have been satisfied, the commission shall not suspend the person's [license or] registration.  If the commission receives the receipt or electronic notice after the effective date of the suspension, the person shall seek the restoration of the [license or] registration through procedures adopted by the commission. c.     The commission shall keep a record of a suspension ordered by the court pursuant to subsection b. of this section.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the suspension of a persons drivers license pursuant to the Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.1 et seq.) after the effective date of P.L.    , c.     (pending before the Legislature of this bill). (cf: P.L.2007, c.280, s.2) 8.    Section 11 of P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.12) is amended to read as follows: 11.  There shall be included in the fines and penalties imposed by the court on a person whose license has been suspended pursuant to [subsection b. of section 9 of this act] the Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.1 et seq.) a fee of $3.00 which shall be transferred by the court to the division.  All fees so transferred shall be deposited in a fund established to effectuate the purposes of [this act] the Parking Offenses Adjudication Act, P.L.1985, c.14 (C.39:4-139.1 et seq.).

Where the license or privileges of any person, or the registration of a motor vehicle registered in [his] the persons name, has been suspended or cancelled under the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law of this State, and the association has paid from the fund any amount in settlement of a claim or towards satisfaction of a judgment against that person, or for the payment of personal injury protection benefits as provided in section 7 and section 10 of [this act] P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-67 and C.39:6-70), the cancellation or suspension shall not be removed, nor the license, privileges, or registration restored, nor shall any new license or privilege be issued or granted to, or registration be permitted to be made by, that person until [he] the person has: (a)   [Repaid in full to the association the amount so paid by him together with interest thereon at 8% per annum from the date of such payment] (deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (b)   Satisfied all requirements of [said] the Motor Vehicle Security-Responsibility Law in respect of giving proof of ability to respond in damages for future accidents, provided, that the court in which [such] the judgment was rendered may, upon 10 days' notice to the association, make an order permitting payment of the amount of [such] the person's indebtedness to the fund, to be made in installments, or in the event the fund makes personal injury protection benefit payments, [such] the person and the fund by agreement may provide for repayment to the fund to be made in installments, and in such case, [such] the person's driver's license, or [his] driving privileges, or registration certificate, if the same have been suspended or revoked, or have expired, may be restored or renewed and shall remain in effect unless and until [such] the person defaults in making any installment payment specified in [such] the order.  In the event of [any such] a default, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission [shall] may upon notice of [such] the default suspend [such] the person's driver's license, or driving privileges or registration certificate until the amount of [his] the persons indebtedness to the fund has been paid in full. (cf:  P.L.2003, c.89, s.32) 10.  The following sections are repealed: N.J.S.2B:12-31; and section 2 of P.L.1981, c.365 (C.39:4-203.2). 11.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates mandatory drivers license suspension as a penalty for various crimes and offenses unrelated to safely operating a motor vehicle. The bill eliminates drivers license suspension as a penalty for convictions of the following crimes and offenses: -crimes for which certain fines, assessments, or restitution are imposed and the defendant is in default without good cause (suspension until past payments are made); -failure to pay motor vehicle violation surcharges (suspension until eight percent of the outstanding surcharges is paid or an installment payment plan is established); -failure to respond to a failure to appear notice or failure to pay a parking judgment (suspension until payment is satisfied); -failure to appear in municipal court (suspension until matter is adjudicated) or failure to satisfy a condition of the sentence, such as pay an assessed fine or perform community service (suspension until condition is satisfied); -failure of an indigent defendant to comply with terms of an installment payment plan for a motor vehicle traffic violation or parking offense; -defaulting on certain financial obligations to the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (until repaid); and -failure to pay child support upon the issuance of a child support-related warrant.  The court retains discretion to suspend the persons drivers license if, after notice and a hearing, the court finds that suspension is warranted. The bill also prohibits the use of arrest as a penalty for unpaid parking tickets and requires the court to notify a defendant who has failed to pay outstanding parking tickets or failed to appear that the penalties for such actions include suspension of motor vehicle registration or the impoundment, immobilization, or possible sale of the persons motor vehicle.  The bill also delays the period that a municipality may impound, immobilize, or authorize the sale of a motor vehicle for unpaid parking tickets from 30 days to 90 days.
