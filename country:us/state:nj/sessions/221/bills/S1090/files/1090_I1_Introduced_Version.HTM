<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 3 of P.L.1996,
c.7 (C.2A:17-56.41) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.   If the child
support arrearage equals or exceeds the amount of child support payable for six
months or court-ordered health care coverage for the child is not provided for
six months, or the obligor fails to respond to a subpoena relating to a
paternity or child support action, or a child support-related warrant exists,
and the obligor is found to possess a license in the State and all appropriate
enforcement methods to collect the child support arrearage have been exhausted,
the Probation Division shall send a written notice to the obligor, by certified
and regular mail, return receipt requested, at the obligor's last-known address
or place of business or employment, advising the obligor that the obligor's
license may be revoked or suspended unless, within 30 days of the postmark date
of the notice, the obligor pays the full amount of the child support arrearage,
or provides proof that health care coverage for the child has been obtained, or
responds to a subpoena, or makes a written request for a court hearing to the
Probation Division.  <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>The
obligor's driver's license shall be suspended by operation of law upon the
issuance of a child support-related warrant.<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> 
If a child support- related warrant for the obligor exists, the professional,
occupational, recreational or sporting license revocation or suspension shall
be terminated if the obligor pays the full amount of the child support
arrearage, provides proof that health care coverage for the child has been
obtained as required by the court order, or surrenders to the county sheriff or
the Probation Division.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the obligor fails to
take one of the actions in subsection a. of this section within 30 days of the
postmark date of the notice and there is proof that service on the obligor was
effective, the Probation Division shall file a certification with the court
setting forth the obligor's non-compliance with the support order and the
obligor's failure to respond to the written notice of the potential license suspension
or revocation.  If, based on the papers filed by the Probation Division, the
court is satisfied that service on the obligor was effective as set forth in
this section, it shall without need for further due process or hearing, enter a
court order suspending or revoking all licenses held by the obligor.  Upon the
entry of the order, the Probation Division shall forward a copy to the obligor
and all appropriate licensing authorities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section, the court may deem procedural due process requirements for notice and
service of process to be met with respect to a party thereto upon delivery of
written notice to the most recent residential or employer address filed with
the Probation Division for that party.  If a party fails to respond to a notice
and no proof is available that the party received the notice, the Probation
Division shall document to the court that it has made a diligent effort to
locate the party by making inquiries that may include, but are not limited to:
the United States Postal Service, the Division of Motor Vehicles in the
Department of Transportation, the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury and the Departments of Labor and Corrections.  The Probation Division
shall provide an affidavit to the court presenting such documentation of its
diligent effort, which certifies its inability to locate the party, before any
adverse action is taken based upon the party's failure to respond to the
notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If the obligor requests
a hearing, the Probation Division shall file a petition for a judicial hearing
in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1996, c.7 (C.2A:17-56.43).  The hearing
shall occur within 45 days of the obligor's request.  If, at or prior to the
hearing, the obligor pays the full amount of the child support arrearage or
provides health care coverage as ordered, or responds to the subpoena or
surrenders to the county sheriff or the Probation Division, the license
revocation process shall be terminated.  No license revocation action shall be
initiated if the Probation Division has received notice that the obligor has
pending a motion to modify the child support order if that motion was filed
prior to the date that the notice of the license suspension or revocation was
sent by the Probation Division. The court shall consider the Probation
Division's petition to revoke or suspend a license in accordance with section 5
of P.L.1996, c.7 (C.2A:17-56.43).</p>

suspended forthwith until at least five percent of each outstanding surcharge
assessment that has resulted in suspension is paid to the commission; except
that the commission may authorize payment of the surcharge on an installment
basis over a period of 12 months for assessments under $2,300 or 24 months for
assessments of $2,300 or more.<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>

the commission by use of a credit card, debit card or other electronic payment
device, and the administrator is authorized to require the person to pay all
costs incurred by the commission in connection with the acceptance of the
credit card, debit card or other electronic payment device.  If a surcharge or
related administrative fee is paid by credit or debit cards or any other
electronic payment device and the amount is subsequently reversed by the credit
card company or bank, <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the

remedy provided by law, the commission is authorized to utilize the provisions
of the SOIL (Set off of Individual Liability) program established pursuant to
P.L.1981, c.239 (C.54A:9-8.1 et seq.) to collect any surcharge levied under
this section and collectible by the commission that is unpaid on or after the
effective date of this act.  As an additional remedy, the commission may issue
a certificate to the Clerk of the Superior Court stating that the person
identified in the certificate is indebted under this surcharge law in such
amount as shall be stated in the certificate.  The certificate shall reference
the statute under which the indebtedness arises.  Thereupon the clerk to whom
such certificate shall have been issued shall immediately enter upon the record
of docketed judgments the name of such person as debtor; the State as creditor;
the address of such person, if shown in the certificate; the amount of the debt
so certified; a reference to the statute under which the surcharge is assessed,
and the date of making such entries.  The docketing of the entries shall have
the same force and effect as a civil judgment docketed in the Superior Court,
and the commission shall have all the remedies and may take all of the
proceedings for the collection thereof which may be had or taken upon the
recovery of a judgment in an action, but without prejudice to any right of
appeal.  Upon entry by the clerk of the certificate in the record of docketed
judgments in accordance with this provision, interest in the amount specified
by the court rules for post-judgment interest shall accrue from the date of the
docketing of the certificate, however payment of the interest may be waived by
the commission or its designee.  In the event that the surcharge remains unpaid
following the issuance of the certificate of debt and the commission takes any
further collection action including referral of the matter to the Attorney
General or his designee, the fee imposed, in lieu of the actual cost of
collection, may be 20 percent of surcharges of $1,000 or more.  The
administrator or his designee may establish a sliding scale, not to exceed a
maximum amount of $200, for surcharge principal amounts of less than $1,000 at
the time the certificate of debt is forwarded to the Superior Court for
filing.  The commission shall provide written notification to a driver of the
proposed filing of the certificate of debt at least 10 days prior to the
proposed filing; such notice shall be mailed to the driver's last address of
record with the commission.  Upon the filing of a certificate of debt with the
Clerk of the Superior Court, the surcharged driver shall not be eligible for
the restoration of his driving privilege until at least five percent of each
outstanding surcharge assessment that has resulted in the suspension, including
interest and costs, if any, is paid to the commission.  If a certificate of
debt is satisfied following a credit card payment, debit card payment or
payment by other electronic payment device and that payment is reversed, a new
certificate of debt shall be filed against the surcharged driver unless the
original is reinstated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the administrator or his
designee approves a special payment plan, of such duration as the administrator
or his designee deems appropriate, for repayment of the certificate of debt,
and the driver is complying with the approved plan, the plan may be continued
for any new surcharge not part of the certificate of debt.</p>
