STATEMENT This bill would allow a county or municipality to use monies in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds.  These funds are often referred to as open space trust funds.  This bill would expand this authorization to allow counties and municipalities to use the monies in such funds for the additional purpose of remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under this bill, a county or municipality would not be required to obtain voter approval to use funds in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes; however, the county or municipality would be required to adopt a resolution or ordinance, as appropriate, prior to doing so, and comply with public notice requirements contained in the bill.

(2)   The notice required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall include: (a)   a general description of the location of the land or lands to be affected, the proposed remediation for the collapsed mine shaft or sinkhole, and the estimated cost of the proposed project; (b)   a schedule setting forth the anticipated commencement and completion date for the proposed project; (c)   the date, time, and place of the public hearing; (d)   instructions detailing the manner in which the public may submit written comments to the governing body of the municipality on or before the date of the public hearing; and (e)   the name and address of the person designated by the governing body of the municipality to receive the written comments and contact for additional information. e.     In no case shall a municipality increase the amount or rate of the levy previously approved by the voters pursuant to P.L.1997, c.24 without submitting a proposition to the voters amending or supplementing the proposition previously submitted, approved, and implemented pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1997, c.24. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow a county or municipality to use monies in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds.  These funds are often referred to as open space trust funds.  This bill would expand this authorization to allow counties and municipalities to use the monies in such funds for the additional purpose of remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under this bill, a county or municipality would not be required to obtain voter approval to use funds in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes; however, the county or municipality would be required to adopt a resolution or ordinance, as appropriate, prior to doing so, and comply with public notice requirements contained in the bill.
