first month next following the date the written notification required pursuant
to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.301 (C.52:9S-3.1) is transmitted

provided, surcharges under this subparagraph (b) shall be levied annually for a

convictions, for a total surcharge of $3,000 for each conviction, and $1,500
per year for the third conviction occurring within a three-year period, for a
total surcharge of $4,500 for the third conviction.  If a driver is convicted
under both R.S.39:4-50 and section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) for
offenses arising out of the same incident, the driver shall be assessed only
one surcharge for the two offenses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission, for good cause,
may authorize payment of any surcharge on an installment basis over a period
not to exceed 36 months.  If a driver fails to pay the surcharge or any
installments on the surcharge, the total surcharge shall become due
immediately, except as otherwise prescribed by rule of the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission may authorize
any person to pay the surcharge levied under this section and collectible by
the commission by use of a credit card, debit card or other electronic payment

electronic payment device and the amount is subsequently reversed by the credit
card company or bank, the driver shall be subject to the fee imposed for
dishonored checks pursuant to section 31 of P.L.1994, c.60 (C.39:5-36.1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to any other
remedy provided by law, the commission is authorized to utilize the provisions
of the SOIL (Set off of Individual Liability) program established pursuant to
P.L.1981, c.239 (C.54A:9-8.1 et seq.) to collect any surcharge levied under this
section and collectible by the commission that is unpaid on or after the

following the date the written notification required pursuant to subsection b.
of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.301 (C.52:9S-3.1) is transmitted to the State
Treasurer and the chief administrator of the commission.  As an additional
remedy, the commission may issue a certificate to the Clerk of the Superior
Court stating that the person identified in the certificate is indebted under
this surcharge law in <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>such<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>an</u>
amount as shall be stated in the certificate.  The certificate shall reference
the statute under which the indebtedness arises.  Thereupon the clerk to whom <b><span

making <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>such<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>the</u>
entries.  The docketing of the entries shall have the same force and effect as
a civil judgment docketed in the Superior Court, and the commission shall have
all the remedies and may take all of the proceedings for the collection thereof
which may be had or taken upon the recovery of a judgment in an action, but
without prejudice to any right of appeal.  Upon entry by the clerk of the
certificate in the record of docketed judgments in accordance with this
provision, interest in the amount specified by the court rules for
post-judgment interest shall accrue from the date of the docketing of the
certificate, however payment of the interest may be waived by the commission or
its designee.  In the event that the surcharge remains unpaid following the
issuance of the certificate of debt and the commission takes any further
collection action including referral of the matter to the Attorney General or
his designee, the fee imposed, in lieu of the actual cost of collection, may be
20 percent of surcharges of $1,000 or more.  The chief administrator or his
designee may establish a sliding scale, not to exceed a maximum amount of $200,
for surcharge principal amounts of less than $1,000 at the time the certificate
of debt is forwarded to the Superior Court for filing.  The commission shall
provide written notification to a driver of the proposed filing of the
certificate of debt at least 10 days prior to the proposed filing; <b><span

notice shall be mailed to the driver's last address of record with the
commission.  Upon the filing of a certificate of debt with the Clerk of the
Superior Court, the surcharged driver shall not be eligible for the restoration
of his driving privilege until at least five percent of each outstanding
surcharge assessment that has resulted in the suspension, including interest
and costs, if any, is paid to the commission.  If a certificate of debt is
satisfied following a credit card payment, debit card payment or payment by other
electronic payment device and that payment is reversed, a new certificate of
debt shall be filed against the surcharged driver unless the original is
reinstated.</p>
