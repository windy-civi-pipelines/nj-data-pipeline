A3400 ASSEMBLY, No. 3400 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 1, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JAY WEBBER District 26 (Morris and Passaic) SYNOPSIS Requires municipalities comprised within regional school districts to share certain payments received in lieu of taxes with counties and regional school districts. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning long-term property tax exemptions and amending P.L.1991, c.431. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 12 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-12) is amended to read as follows: 12.  The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment area or area appurtenant thereto or for a redevelopment relocation housing project, pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  When housing is to be constructed, acquired or rehabilitated by an urban renewal entity, the land upon which that housing is situated shall be exempt from taxation for a limited period as hereinafter provided.  The exemption shall be allowed when the clerk of the municipality wherein the property is situated shall certify to the municipal tax assessor that a financial agreement with an urban renewal entity for the development or the redevelopment of the property, or the provision of a redevelopment relocation housing project, or the provision of a low and moderate income housing project has been entered into and is in effect as required by P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.). Delivery by the municipal clerk to the municipal tax assessor of a certified copy of the ordinance of the governing body approving the tax exemption and financial agreement with the urban renewal entity shall constitute the required certification.  For each exemption granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.), upon certification as required hereunder, the tax assessor shall implement the exemption and continue to enforce that exemption without further certification by the clerk until the expiration of the entitlement to exemption by the terms of the financial agreement or until the tax assessor has been duly notified by the clerk that the exemption has been terminated. Within 10 calendar days following the later of the effective date of an ordinance following its final adoption by the governing body approving the tax exemption or the execution of the financial agreement by the urban renewal entity, the municipal clerk shall transmit a certified copy of the ordinance and financial agreement to the chief financial officer of the county and to the county counsel for informational purposes. Whenever an exemption status changes during a tax year, the procedure for the apportionment of the taxes for the year shall be the same as in the case of other changes in tax exemption status during the tax year.  Tax exemptions granted pursuant to P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) represent long term financial agreements between the municipality and the urban renewal entity and as such constitute a single continuing exemption from local property taxation for the duration of the financial agreement.  The validity of a financial agreement or any exemption granted pursuant thereto may be challenged only by filing an action in lieu of prerogative writ within 20 days from the publication of a notice of the adoption of an ordinance by the governing body granting the exemption and approving the financial agreement.  Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if different from the municipal newspaper. a.     The financial agreement shall specify the duration of the exemption for urban renewal entities in accordance with the parameters of either paragraph (1) or paragraph (2) of this subsection: (1)   the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement between the municipality and the urban renewal entity; or (2)   for each project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially, the financial agreement may specify a duration of not more than 30 years from the completion of a project, or unit of the project if the project is undertaken in units, or not more than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  As used in this subsection, "redevelopment agreement" means an agreement entered into pursuant to subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-8) between a municipality or redevelopment entity and a redeveloper. A financial agreement may provide for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project, less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring a financial agreement for a project undertaken pursuant to a redevelopment agreement which allows the redeveloper to undertake two or more projects sequentially to specify a duration within the parameters of paragraph (2) of this subsection. b.    During the term of any exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings and improvements of the project and, to the extent authorized pursuant to this section, on the land, the urban renewal entity shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit a portion of that revenue to the county as provided hereinafter.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the urban renewal entity for any period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (1)   An annual amount equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the annual gross revenue from each unit of the project, if the project is undertaken in units, or from the total project, if the project is not undertaken in units.  The percentage of the annual gross revenue shall not be more than 15% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, nor less than 10% in the case of all other projects. At the option of the municipality, or where because of the nature of the development, ownership, use or occupancy of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is to be undertaken in units, the total annual gross rental or gross shelter rent or annual gross revenue cannot be reasonably ascertained, the governing body shall provide in the financial agreement that the annual service charge shall be a sum equal to a percentage determined pursuant to this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), of the total project cost or total project unit cost determined pursuant to P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) calculated from the first day of the month following the substantial completion of the project or any unit thereof, if the project is undertaken in units.  The percentage of the total project cost or total project unit cost shall not be more than 2% in the case of a low and moderate income housing project, and shall not be less than 2% in the case of all other projects. (2)   In either case, the financial agreement shall establish a schedule of annual service charges to be paid over the term of the exemption period, which shall be in stages as follows: (a)   For the first stage of the exemption period, which shall commence with the date of completion of the unit or of the project, as the case may be, and continue for a time of not less than six years nor more than 15 years, as specified in the financial agreement, the urban renewal entity shall pay the municipality an annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project in an annual amount equal to the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11).  For the remainder of the period of the exemption, if any, the annual service charge shall be determined as follows: (b)   For the second stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 20% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (c)   For the third stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 40% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; (d)   For the fourth stage of the exemption period, which shall not be less than one year nor more than six years, as specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 60% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater; and (e)   For the final stage of the exemption period, the duration of which shall not be less than one year and shall be specified in the financial agreement, an amount equal to either the amount determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 11 of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-11), or 80% of the amount of taxes otherwise due on the value of the land and improvements, whichever shall be greater. If the financial agreement provides for an exemption period of less than 30 years from the completion of the entire project,  less than 35 years from the execution of the financial agreement, or less than 50 years from the execution of the first financial agreement implementing a project under the redevelopment agreement, the financial agreement shall set forth a schedule of annual service charges for the exemption period which shall be based upon the minimum service charges and staged adjustments set forth in this section. The annual service charge shall be paid to the municipality on a quarterly basis in a manner consistent with the municipality's tax collection schedule. Each municipality which enters into a financial agreement on or after the effective date of P.L.2003, c.125 (C.40A:12A-4.1 et al.) shall remit a portion of the annual service charge as follows: (i)    In a municipality not comprised within a regional school district, the municipality shall remit 5 percent of the annual service charge collected by the municipality to the county in accordance with the provisions of R.S.54:4-74. (ii)   In a municipality comprised within a regional school district, following the effective date of P.L.    , c.   (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the municipality shall remit a percentage of the annual service charge to the county and to the regional school district immediately upon receipt of that charge, in proportion to the distribution of the amount raised by taxation in the taxing district to those entities, as displayed on the prior years tax bill pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection b. of R.S.54:4-65. Against the annual service charge the urban renewal entity shall be entitled to credit for the amount, without interest, of the real estate taxes on land paid by it in the last four preceding quarterly installments. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of the financial agreement, the minimum annual service charge shall be the amount of the total taxes levied against all real property in the area covered by the project in the last full tax year in which the area was subject to taxation, and the minimum annual service charge shall be paid in each year in which the annual service charge calculated pursuant to this section or the financial agreement would be less than the minimum annual service charge. c.     All exemptions granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.) shall terminate at the time prescribed in the financial agreement. Upon the termination of the exemption granted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et seq.), the project, all affected parcels, land and all improvements made thereto shall be assessed and subject to taxation as are other taxable properties in the municipality.  After the date of termination, all restrictions and limitations upon the urban renewal entity shall terminate and be at an end upon the entity's rendering its final accounting to and with the municipality. (cf: P.L.2018, c.97, s.17) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require municipalities comprised within a regional school district to provide a portion of the amounts received in lieu of property taxation from urban renewal entities to the county and to the regional school district.  A municipality that receives a payment in lieu of taxation from an urban renewal entity would be required to distribute a portion of the amount received, immediately upon receipt, to the county and to the regional school district based upon the distribution of the amount raised by taxation in the taxing district to those entities in the prior year.
