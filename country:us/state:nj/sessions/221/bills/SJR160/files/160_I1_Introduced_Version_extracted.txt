SJR160 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION No. 160 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 12, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  RENEE C. BURGESS District 28 (Essex and Union) SYNOPSIS Designates August of each year as Psoriasis Awareness Month. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating August of each year as Psoriasis Awareness Month. Whereas, Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune skin disease that, in its most common form, causes painful, itchy lesions of red, inflamed skin covered with silvery scales; and Whereas, These lesions most often occur on the elbows, knees, legs, lower back, scalp, face, palms, and soles of the feet, but they can occur anywhere on the skin, including on the fingernails, toenails, soft tissues of the genitals, and inside of the mouth; and Whereas, Psoriasis is not contagious, but is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors that causes the bodys immune system to mistakenly think that the bodys own cells are foreign cells.  This causes skin cells to grow rapidly and accumulate in the skins top layers, leading to the formation of lesions; and Whereas, Psoriasis appears equally in men and women and affects individuals of all ethnicities and age groups; and Whereas, Psoriasis primarily affects adults; and Whereas, According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, psoriasis affects more than eight million people in the United States; and Whereas, The National Institutes of Health estimates that about 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. This condition causes joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, similar to rheumatoid arthritis, along with painful swelling in the fingers and toes, foot pain, and lower back discomfort; and Whereas, People with psoriasis may experience significant physical discomfort that affects their mobility, sleep, self-care, ability to care for family members, employment in certain occupations, and participation in physical exercise or rigorous activities; and Whereas, People with psoriasis often experience significant psychological distress, including self-consciousness, stigma about their appearance, and fear of public rejection, depression, and social isolation; and Whereas, Although various treatments are available, effectively managing psoriasis can be challenging due to its unpredictable cycles of improvement and worsening, individual differences in treatment response, the potential for resistance to repeated treatments over time, and the serious side effects associated with certain therapies; and Whereas, Many people mistakenly believe that psoriasis is a cosmetic issue caused by poor hygiene or other self-inflicted factors, leading to a lack of understanding and sympathy for those affected; and Whereas, In New Jersey, the Psoriasis Treatment Center of New Jersey has reported positive outcomes in recent clinical trials, with 52 percent of adult patients achieving the National Psoriasis Foundation's treat-to-target goal of one percent body surface area; and Whereas, It is appropriate for the State of New Jersey to improve public  awareness and understanding of this misunderstood health issue, encourage support for those individuals who have been afflicted by psoriasis, and to promote more initiatives at the State, local, and national levels to enhance research into treating this disease; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The month of August of each year shall be designated as Psoriasis Awareness Month to increase awareness of this painful autoimmune disease, its impact on the residents of this State, and to promote further research into effective treatments. 2.    The Governor is respectively requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing August of each year as Psoriasis Awareness Month in New Jersey, and call upon public officials and the citizens of this State to observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates August of each year as Psoriasis Awareness Month in New Jersey to improve public awareness and understanding of this misunderstood health issue, encourage support for those diagnosed with psoriasis, and to promote more initiatives at the State, local, and national levels to enhance research into treating this disease. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes painful, itchy lesions of red and inflamed skin covered with silvery scales.  These lesions can occur anywhere on the skin, but most often occur on the elbows, knees, legs, lower back, scalp, face, palms, and soles of the feet.  People with psoriasis often experience significant psychological distress, including self-consciousness, stigma about their appearance, and fear of public rejection, depression, and social isolation.  People with psoriasis may also experience significant physical discomfort that affects their mobility, sleep, self-care, ability to care for family members, employment in certain occupations, and participation in physical exercise. Psoriasis affects an estimated eight million people in the United States.  The disease appears equally in men and women and affects individuals of all ethnicities and age groups.  Although several treatments for psoriasis currently exist, effective treatment can be challenging due to the diseases unpredictable nature and patients varying responses to treatment.  In New Jersey, the Psoriasis Treatment Center of New Jersey has reported positive outcomes in recent clinical trials, with 52 percent of adult patients achieving the National Psoriasis Foundation's treat-to-target goal of one percent body surface area.  Raising public awareness about the causes, symptoms, and impact of psoriasis can help dispel misconceptions, foster greater support for those affected, and promote further research into more effective treatments.
