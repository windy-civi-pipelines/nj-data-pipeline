by evidence that it was committed in any manner that would be theft or computer
criminal activity under this chapter, notwithstanding the specification of a
different manner in the indictment or accusation, subject only to the power of
the court to ensure fair trial by granting a bill of particulars, discovery, a continuance,
or other appropriate relief where the conduct of the defense would be
prejudiced by lack of fair notice or by surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Presumptions. Any person
purposely concealing unpurchased merchandise of any store or other retail
mercantile establishment, either on the premises or outside the premises of
such store or other retail mercantile establishment, shall be prima facie
presumed to have so concealed such merchandise with the intention of depriving
the merchant of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without
paying the full retail value thereof, and the finding of such merchandise
concealed upon the person or among the belongings of such person shall be prima
facie evidence of purposeful concealment; and if such person conceals, or
causes to be concealed, such merchandise upon the person or among the
belongings of another, the finding of the same shall also be prima facie
evidence of willful concealment on the part of the person so concealing such
merchandise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     A law enforcement
officer, or a special officer, or a merchant, who has probable cause for
believing that a person has willfully concealed unpurchased merchandise and
that he can recover the merchandise by taking the person into custody, may, for
the purpose of attempting to effect recovery thereof, take the person into
custody and detain him in a reasonable manner for not more than a reasonable
time, and the taking into custody by a law enforcement officer or special
officer or merchant shall not render such person criminally or civilly liable
in any manner or to any extent whatsoever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any law enforcement officer
may arrest without warrant any person he has probable cause for believing has
committed the offense of shoplifting as defined in this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A merchant who causes the
arrest of a person for shoplifting, as provided for in this section, shall not
be criminally or civilly liable in any manner or to any extent whatsoever where
the merchant has probable cause for believing that the person arrested
committed the offense of shoplifting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Any person who
possesses or uses any antishoplifting or inventory control device
countermeasure within any store or other retail mercantile establishment is
guilty of a disorderly persons offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf: P.L.2006, c.56, s.1)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7. This act shall take effect
immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
provisions found in several of the theft statutes concerning the aggregation of
the value of stolen property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law allows the value
of stolen property to be aggregated so that a higher degree of crime can be
charged if the property being aggregated was stolen pursuant to one scheme or
course of conduct.  The bill clarifies that one scheme or course of conduct
can be carried out across multiple criminal episodes or transactions, against
the same or several victims, or across a single county or multiple counties. 
Under the bill, evidence that multiple episodes or transactions constitute one
scheme or course of conduct may include, but is not limited to, evidence that
the acts involve the same defendant or defendants, are substantially similar in
nature, and occur within a two-year period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the consolidated theft
statute, N.J.S.A.2C:20-2, theft is a crime of the second degree if the amount
involved is $75,000 or more.  Theft is a crime of the third degree if the
amount is more than $500 but less than $75,000.  Theft is a crime of the fourth
degree if the amount is between $200 and $500.  Theft is a disorderly persons
offense if the amount is less than $200.  These same monetary amounts also
apply when grading the level of offense for receiving stolen property, fencing
stolen property, and shoplifting.  Concerning motor vehicle theft and receiving
stolen motor vehicles, these are crimes of the second degree if the value of the
vehicle is $75,000 or more; otherwise they are crimes of the third degree.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A crime of the second degree
is punishable by a term of imprisonment of five to ten years, a fine of up to
$150,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of
imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime
of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18
months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is
punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to
$1,000, or both.</p>
