Any individual, including an individual who is not directly employed by a municipality, with the authority to administer, allocate or approve the use of zone assistance funds is subject to the "Local Government Ethics Law," P.L.1991, c.29 (C.40A:9-22.1 et seq.), unless the individual is a State employee or a special State officer. b.    The enterprise zone assistance fund shall be used for the purpose of assisting qualifying municipalities in which enterprise zones are designated in undertaking economic development projects in designated enterprise zones by funding qualified assistance fund expenses.  However, a municipality shall not appropriate or expend: more than 25 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for public safety purposes, as described [pursuant to] in paragraph (4) of subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62); or more than 10 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for administrative expenses. c.     The governing body of a qualifying municipality in which an enterprise zone is designated and the zone development corporation created or designated by the municipality for that enterprise zone may, by resolution jointly adopted after public hearing, propose to undertake an economic development project in the enterprise zone, and to fund that project from moneys deposited in the enterprise zone assistance fund and credited to the account maintained by the State Treasurer for the enterprise zone. The proposal so adopted shall set forth a plan for the project and shall include: (1)   A description of the proposed project; (2)   An estimate of the total project costs, and an estimate of the amounts of funding necessary annually from the enterprise zone account; (3)   A statement of any other revenue sources to be used to finance the project; (4)   A statement of the time necessary to complete the project; (5)   A statement of the manner in which the proposed project furthers the municipality's policy and intentions for addressing economic development in the enterprise zone as set forth in the zone development plan approved by the authority; and (6)   A description of the financial and programmatic controls and reporting mechanisms to be used to guarantee that the funds will be spent in accordance with the plan and that the project will accomplish its purpose. As used in this section, "project" means an activity that satisfies the requirements of a qualified assistance fund expense, as that term is defined in subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62), and which will lead to the creation of new jobs and increased economic activity within the zone. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) h.    At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not encumbered a portion of its allocation, such amount may be carried forward to the next State fiscal year and the State fiscal year thereafter.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any of those unencumbered funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. i.     At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not expended or otherwise committed a portion of its encumbered funds, then such amount may be carried forward to the next three succeeding State fiscal years.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any unexpended funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. j.     At the end of a State fiscal year, the Department of Community Affairs shall review an enterprise zone's expenditures of funds received from the zone assistance fund.  If the department finds that an enterprise zone expended such funds in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.) and P.L.2021, c.197, then the enterprise zone shall repay such funds to the department through the forfeiture of future zone assistance fund disbursements.  The department shall withhold future funding from the enterprise zone until the enterprise zone enters into and complies with a corrective action plan developed by the department. k.    If in a State fiscal year the amount allocated to the enterprise zone assistance fund is less than the amount required to be allocated to fulfill the purposes of this section pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) and paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the Legislature shall appropriate to the enterprise zone assistance fund the amount that was not allocated in such State fiscal year in a succeeding State fiscal year along with the funds required to be allocated in that State fiscal year. (cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.10) 3.  Section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.  The combined State tax expenditures in State Fiscal Year 2022 for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases, as expressed in the Fiscal Year 2022 State of New Jersey Tax Expenditure Report, shall be the "ZAF base fund amount." In State Fiscal Year 2023, the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall be determined as follows: The State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall determine the combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases in the six-month period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2022.  The combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases for the six-month period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2022, shall be multiplied by two and then subtracted from the ZAF base fund amount.  The difference shall be the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) in State Fiscal Year 2023 [appropriation to the enterprise zone assistance fund]. Beginning in State Fiscal Year 2024, and in each State fiscal year thereafter, the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall be determined as follows: After January 1 but prior to June 30, the State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall develop a methodology to compare the combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases in the prior State fiscal year with the ZAF base fund amount to calculate the savings achieved by P.L.2021, c.197.  The savings determined shall be the amount appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) for the State fiscal year. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, for State Fiscal Year 2023 and thereafter, the amount appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall not exceed $82,500,000, and in Fiscal Year 2024, and in each year thereafter, $82,500,000 as adjusted annually based on the percentage change in the 12-month Consumer Price Index from June 30 to July 1 of each year, and shall be no less than $60,000,000.  Should the balance of the enterprise zone assistance fund be in excess of the amount appropriated annually to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88), such excess amount shall be deposited in the General Fund.  If the application of the formulas set forth in subsection a. of this section will result in an appropriation to the enterprise zone assistance fund that is less than $60,000,000 and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) in any State fiscal year, then the State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall impose a limit on the receipts from retail sales of tangible personal property and sales of services to a qualified business that are exempt from the sales and use tax pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-79); provided, however, that no less than the receipts from the first $50,000 of retail sales of tangible personal property and sales of services to a qualified business shall be exempt from the sales and use tax in accordance with section 20 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-79). (cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.11) 4.  There is appropriated $82,500,000 from the General Fund to the enterprise zone assistance fund created pursuant to section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) for the purposes of that fund, and for the uses prescribed in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88). 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill clarifies the process for appropriating revenue under the State Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ) Program for use within UEZs. Specifically, this bill clarifies this process by: (1) requiring the revenues collected in UEZs from retail sales subject to the 50 percent sales tax exemption to be deposited in the Zone Assistance Fund (ZAF); (2) providing that the UEZ revenue flows directly to the ZAF; (3) appropriating $82.5 million to the ZAF from the General Fund; (4) excluding the sales of medical and recreational cannabis, and related supplies from the 50 percent sales tax exemption within UEZs, as is currently the case for alcoholic beverages and other goods and services; and (5) making certain technical changes.

Any individual, including an individual who is not directly employed by a municipality, with the authority to administer, allocate or approve the use of zone assistance funds is subject to the "Local Government Ethics Law," P.L.1991, c.29 (C.40A:9-22.1 et seq.), unless the individual is a State employee or a special State officer. b.    The enterprise zone assistance fund shall be used for the purpose of assisting qualifying municipalities in which enterprise zones are designated in undertaking economic development projects in designated enterprise zones by funding qualified assistance fund expenses.  However, a municipality shall not appropriate or expend: more than 25 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for public safety purposes, as described [pursuant to] in paragraph (4) of subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62); or more than 10 percent of the amount annually credited to its enterprise zone assistance fund for administrative expenses. c.     The governing body of a qualifying municipality in which an enterprise zone is designated and the zone development corporation created or designated by the municipality for that enterprise zone may, by resolution jointly adopted after public hearing, propose to undertake an economic development project in the enterprise zone, and to fund that project from moneys deposited in the enterprise zone assistance fund and credited to the account maintained by the State Treasurer for the enterprise zone. The proposal so adopted shall set forth a plan for the project and shall include: (1)   A description of the proposed project; (2)   An estimate of the total project costs, and an estimate of the amounts of funding necessary annually from the enterprise zone account; (3)   A statement of any other revenue sources to be used to finance the project; (4)   A statement of the time necessary to complete the project; (5)   A statement of the manner in which the proposed project furthers the municipality's policy and intentions for addressing economic development in the enterprise zone as set forth in the zone development plan approved by the authority; and (6)   A description of the financial and programmatic controls and reporting mechanisms to be used to guarantee that the funds will be spent in accordance with the plan and that the project will accomplish its purpose. As used in this section, "project" means an activity that satisfies the requirements of a qualified assistance fund expense, as that term is defined in subsection m. of section 3 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-62), and which will lead to the creation of new jobs and increased economic activity within the zone. d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2021, c.197) h.    At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not encumbered a portion of its allocation, such amount may be carried forward to the next State fiscal year and the State fiscal year thereafter.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any of those unencumbered funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. i.     At the end of a State fiscal year, if a municipality has not expended or otherwise committed a portion of its encumbered funds, then such amount may be carried forward to the next three succeeding State fiscal years.  If at the end of the third State fiscal year any unexpended funds remain, then the funds shall be transferred to the UEZ Authority's account in the enterprise zone assistance fund. j.     At the end of a State fiscal year, the Department of Community Affairs shall review an enterprise zone's expenditures of funds received from the zone assistance fund.  If the department finds that an enterprise zone expended such funds in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.) and P.L.2021, c.197, then the enterprise zone shall repay such funds to the department through the forfeiture of future zone assistance fund disbursements.  The department shall withhold future funding from the enterprise zone until the enterprise zone enters into and complies with a corrective action plan developed by the department. k.    If in a State fiscal year the amount allocated to the enterprise zone assistance fund is less than the amount required to be allocated to fulfill the purposes of this section pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) and paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the Legislature shall appropriate to the enterprise zone assistance fund the amount that was not allocated in such State fiscal year in a succeeding State fiscal year along with the funds required to be allocated in that State fiscal year. (cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.10) 3.  Section 11 of P.L.2021, c.197 (C.52:27H-98) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.  The combined State tax expenditures in State Fiscal Year 2022 for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases, as expressed in the Fiscal Year 2022 State of New Jersey Tax Expenditure Report, shall be the "ZAF base fund amount." In State Fiscal Year 2023, the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall be determined as follows: The State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall determine the combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases in the six-month period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2022.  The combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases for the six-month period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending June 30, 2022, shall be multiplied by two and then subtracted from the ZAF base fund amount.  The difference shall be the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) in State Fiscal Year 2023 [appropriation to the enterprise zone assistance fund]. Beginning in State Fiscal Year 2024, and in each State fiscal year thereafter, the amount to be appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall be determined as follows: After January 1 but prior to June 30, the State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall develop a methodology to compare the combined State tax expenditures for the Urban Enterprise Zone Special Sales Tax Rate and Urban Enterprise Zone Exempt Business Purchases in the prior State fiscal year with the ZAF base fund amount to calculate the savings achieved by P.L.2021, c.197.  The savings determined shall be the amount appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) for the State fiscal year. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, for State Fiscal Year 2023 and thereafter, the amount appropriated to the enterprise zone assistance fund and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) shall not exceed $82,500,000, and in Fiscal Year 2024, and in each year thereafter, $82,500,000 as adjusted annually based on the percentage change in the 12-month Consumer Price Index from June 30 to July 1 of each year, and shall be no less than $60,000,000.  Should the balance of the enterprise zone assistance fund be in excess of the amount appropriated annually to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88), such excess amount shall be deposited in the General Fund.  If the application of the formulas set forth in subsection a. of this section will result in an appropriation to the enterprise zone assistance fund that is less than $60,000,000 and made available to fulfill the purposes set forth in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) in any State fiscal year, then the State Treasurer, in consultation with the UEZ Authority, shall impose a limit on the receipts from retail sales of tangible personal property and sales of services to a qualified business that are exempt from the sales and use tax pursuant to section 20 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-79); provided, however, that no less than the receipts from the first $50,000 of retail sales of tangible personal property and sales of services to a qualified business shall be exempt from the sales and use tax in accordance with section 20 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-79). (cf: P.L.2021, c.197, s.11) 4.  There is appropriated $82,500,000 from the General Fund to the enterprise zone assistance fund created pursuant to section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88) for the purposes of that fund, and for the uses prescribed in section 29 of P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-88). 5.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill clarifies the process for appropriating revenue under the State Urban Enterprise Zone (UEZ) Program for use within UEZs. Specifically, this bill clarifies this process by: (1) requiring the revenues collected in UEZs from retail sales subject to the 50 percent sales tax exemption to be deposited in the Zone Assistance Fund (ZAF); (2) providing that the UEZ revenue flows directly to the ZAF; (3) appropriating $82.5 million to the ZAF from the General Fund; (4) excluding the sales of medical and recreational cannabis, and related supplies from the 50 percent sales tax exemption within UEZs, as is currently the case for alcoholic beverages and other goods and services; and (5) making certain technical changes.
