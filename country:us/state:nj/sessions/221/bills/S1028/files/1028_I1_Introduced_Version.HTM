<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1974,
c.49 (C.2A:18-61.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    No lessee or tenant or
the assigns, under-tenants or legal representatives of such lessee or tenant
may be removed by the Superior Court from any house, building, mobile home or
land in a mobile home park or tenement leased for residential purposes, other
than (1) owner-occupied premises with not more than two rental units or a
hotel, motel or other guest house or part thereof rented to a transient guest
or seasonal tenant; (2) a dwelling unit which is held in trust on behalf of a
member of the immediate family of the person or persons establishing the trust,
provided that the member of the immediate family on whose behalf the trust is
established permanently occupies the unit; and (3) a dwelling unit which is
permanently occupied by a member of the immediate family of the owner of that
unit, provided, however, that exception (2) or (3) shall apply only in cases in
which the member of the immediate family has a developmental disability, except
upon establishment of one of the following grounds as good cause:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The person fails to pay
rent due and owing under the lease whether the same be oral or written;
provided that, for the purposes of this section, any portion of rent unpaid by
a tenant to a landlord but utilized by the tenant to continue utility service
to the rental premises after receiving notice from an electric, gas, water or
sewer public utility that such service was in danger of discontinuance based on
nonpayment by the landlord, shall not be deemed to be unpaid rent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The person has continued
to be, after written notice to cease, so disorderly as to destroy the peace and
quiet of the occupants or other tenants living in said house or neighborhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The person has willfully
or by reason of gross negligence caused or allowed destruction, damage or
injury to the premises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The person has
continued, after written notice to cease, to substantially violate or breach
any of the landlord's rules and regulations governing said premises, provided
such rules and regulations are reasonable and have been accepted in writing by
the tenant or made a part of the lease at the beginning of the lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     (1)  The person has
continued, after written notice to cease, to substantially violate or breach
any of the covenants or agreements contained in the lease for the premises
where a right of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>reentry is reserved to the landlord
in the lease for a violation of such covenant or agreement, provided that such
covenant or agreement is reasonable and was contained in the lease at the
beginning of the lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   In public housing under
the control of a public housing authority or redevelopment agency, the person
has substantially violated or breached any of the covenants or agreements contained
in the lease for the premises pertaining to illegal uses of controlled
dangerous substances, or other illegal activities, whether or not a right of
reentry is reserved to the landlord in the lease for a violation of such
covenant or agreement, provided that such covenant or agreement conforms to
federal guidelines regarding such lease provisions and was contained in the
lease at the beginning of the lease term.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The person has failed
to pay rent after a valid <u>written</u> notice to quit and <u>written</u> notice
of increase of said rent, provided the increase in rent is not unconscionable
and complies with any and all other laws or municipal ordinances governing rent
increases.  <u>If the tenant is a resident of a senior citizen housing project,
as defined in section 2 of P.L.1995, c.144 (C.2A:42-113), then the notice of
increase in rent shall explain the reasons for the rent increase.  This
explanation shall:</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(1)  describe why the rent
increase is not unconscionable; </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(2)  confirm that the rent
increase complies with all municipal ordinances, and other applicable laws,
governing rent increases; and</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>(3)  list the expenses, if
any, associated with the tenants unit, and with common areas of the property,
as applicable, that have contributed to the need for a rent increase.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The landlord or owner
(1) seeks to permanently board up or demolish the premises because he has been
cited by local or State housing inspectors for substantial violations affecting
the health and safety of tenants and it is economically unfeasible for the
owner to eliminate the violations; (2) seeks to comply with local or State
housing inspectors who have cited him for substantial violations affecting the
health and safety of tenants and it is unfeasible to so comply without removing
the tenant; simultaneously with service of notice of eviction pursuant to this
clause, the landlord shall notify the Department of Community Affairs of the
intention to institute proceedings and shall provide the department with such
other information as it may require pursuant to rules and regulations.  The
department shall inform all parties and the court of its view with respect to
the feasibility of compliance without removal of the tenant and may in its
discretion appear and present evidence; (3) seeks to correct an illegal
occupancy because he has been cited by local or State housing inspectors or
zoning officers and it is unfeasible to correct such illegal occupancy without
removing the tenant; or (4) is a governmental agency which seeks to permanently
retire the premises from the rental market pursuant to a redevelopment or land
clearance plan in a blighted area. In those cases where the tenant is being
removed for any reason specified in this subsection, no warrant for possession

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Many New Jersey residents
struggle to satisfy the costs of renting a home.  These costs are often
particularly challenging for senior citizens, many of whom live on a
fixed-income.  New Jersey law presently requires a landlord to provide written
notice to the tenant whenever the landlord intends to increase rent.  State law
also prohibits unconscionable rent increases, a concept defined in case law
as one that would shock the conscience of a reasonable person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Along with the existing rent
increase notice requirement, this bill would require the landlords of certain
senior housing to also provide an explanation for the increase.  More
specifically, the bill would require that if the tenant is a resident of a
senior citizen housing project, then the notice of increased rent would be
required to be in writing, and would include an explanation of why the rent is
increasing.  This explanation would:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   describe why the rent
increase is not unconscionable; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   confirm that the increase
complies with municipal ordinances, and other applicable laws; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   list any expenses
associated with the tenants unit and common areas of the property that have
contributed to the need for the rent increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, this bill
adjusts the underlying statutory language concerning notice requirements prior
to rent increases to clarify that those notices have to be in writing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As used in the bill, a senior
citizen housing project refers to a building with three or more dwelling
units, intended for, and solely occupied by, senior citizens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would take effect on
the first day of the third month next following enactment, and would apply to
rent increases that take effect on or after that date.</p>
