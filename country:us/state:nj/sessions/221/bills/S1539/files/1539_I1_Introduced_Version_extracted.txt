(2)   A school district may request approval from the commissioner to calculate EP equal to 1.00 for any increase in weighted resident enrollment if it can demonstrate that the calculation pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection would result in an average class size that exceeds 10% above the facilities efficiency standards established pursuant to P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.). c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) d.    (1)  The allowable adjustment for increases in health care costs authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total health care costs for the budget year, less any withdrawals from the current expense emergency reserve account for increases in total health care costs, that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total health care costs in the prebudget year, but that is not in excess of the product of the total health care costs in the prebudget year multiplied by the average percentage increase of the State Health Benefits Program, P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.25 et seq.), as annually determined by the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury. (2)   The allowable adjustment for increases in the amount of normal and accrued liability pension contributions authorized pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall equal that portion of the actual increase in total normal and accrued liability pension contributions for the budget year that exceeds 2.0 percent of the total normal and accrued liability pension contributions in the prebudget year. (3) In the case of an SDA district, as defined pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-3), in which the prebudget year adjusted tax levy is less than the school districts prebudget year local share as calculated pursuant to section 10 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-52), the allowable adjustment for increases to raise a tax levy that does not exceed the school districts local share shall equal the difference between the prebudget year adjusted tax levy and the prebudget year local share. e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2010, c.44) f.     The adjusted tax levy shall be increased or decreased accordingly whenever the responsibility and associated cost of a school district activity is transferred to another school district or governmental entity. (cf: P.L.2018, c.67, s.6) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year beginning after enactment. STATEMENT This bill would require that, upon adoption of a resolution by the governing body or bodies of a municipality or municipalities constituting a school district, a nonpublic school which offers an educational program for students in grades 9 through 12, or in any one or more of those grade levels, or an independent institution of higher education to annually make a payment for any student who resides in a tax-exempt facility located on property owned by the entity and is enrolled in a public school district or a charter school.  The amount of the payment will equal the district's per pupil general fund local levy amount for the budget year. Under the bill's provisions, annually by November 1 of the budget year, a board of education would notify the nonpublic school or independent college or university of the number of resident students enrolled in the school district or a charter school who reside in a tax-exempt facility owned by the entity, the per pupil general fund local levy amount, and the total payment owed to the district.  The payment must be forwarded to the board of education within 60 days of receipt of the notice of the required payment.  The recipient districts tax levy growth cap for the subsequent school year will be reduced by the amount of the total payment received under this bill, thus ensuring that the additional revenue is used to reduce property taxes.
