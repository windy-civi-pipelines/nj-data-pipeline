locally and regionally produced foods, food products, and ingredients and, particularly,

of Agriculture and Education, and by school food authorities, food service management
companies, and other third-party food vendors throughout the State, in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education, working in
cooperation and consultation with one another, to establish and implement a
Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, not more than 180 days after the
bills effective date.  The purpose and goals of the Know Your Farmer, Know
Your Food initiative would be to promote and facilitate the increased and
expanded procurement and use, by school food authorities, and by associated food
service management corporations and other third-party food vendors, for school

produced foods, food products, and ingredients, particularly, those produced by
farmers, ranchers, and other food producers or production systems in New
Jersey.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This legislation is intended both
to increase student awareness regarding the availability and benefits of
procuring and consuming foods that are grown and produced, from the land, by
individual farmers, ranchers, and other food producers in the local and
regional area, and to encourage the increased purchasing and consumption, by
students, of these types of locally and regionally produced, land-derived
foods, as an alternative to other types of foods commonly sold by supermarkets,
corner stores, and drive-through establishments.  By putting a local face to
the food students are eating, the State can more directly show students the
benefits of eating locally and regionally grown foods, and can better
demonstrate how the use of money to purchase goods produced by such local and
regional farmers, ranchers, and other, similar land-based food producers can
ultimately help local communities thrive. </p>
