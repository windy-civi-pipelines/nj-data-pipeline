Any definitions or boundaries established, pursuant to this subsection, shall be consistent with relevant definitions and boundaries established, by the United States Department of Agriculture or the United States Department of Education, in association with the implementation of federal farm-to-school initiatives. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education, working in cooperation and consultation with one another, to establish and implement a Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, not more than 180 days after the bills effective date.  The purpose and goals of the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative would be to promote and facilitate the increased and expanded procurement and use, by school food authorities, and by associated food service management corporations and other third-party food vendors, for school meals program purposes, and the increased selection by students, for daily consumption under the States school meals programs, of locally and regionally produced foods, food products, and ingredients, particularly, those produced by farmers, ranchers, and other food producers or production systems in New Jersey. This legislation is intended both to increase student awareness regarding the availability and benefits of procuring and consuming foods that are grown and produced, from the land, by individual farmers, ranchers, and other food producers in the local and regional area, and to encourage the increased purchasing and consumption, by students, of these types of locally and regionally produced, land-derived foods, as an alternative to other types of foods commonly sold by supermarkets, corner stores, and drive-through establishments.  By putting a local face to the food students are eating, the State can more directly show students the benefits of eating locally and regionally grown foods, and can better demonstrate how the use of money to purchase goods produced by such local and regional farmers, ranchers, and other, similar land-based food producers can ultimately help local communities thrive.

(3)   highlight and recognize, during each month of each year, at least one local or regional farmer, rancher, or other food producer or production system which has made significant contributions to the States school meals programs, or which has utilized unique or particularly effective or otherwise notable means to facilitate the development or maintenance of economically productive relationships and associated food procurement arrangements with school food authorities, food service management companies, and other third-party food service vendors, as necessary to facilitate the ongoing procurement and use of foods, food products, and ingredients produced, by the local or regional farmer, rancher, or food producer or production system, for school meals program purposes.  When determining which farmers, ranchers, and food producers or production systems to monthly recognize and highlight pursuant to, and for the purposes of, this paragraph, preference shall be given to those local farmers, local ranchers, and other local food producers and production systems which are located in New Jersey; (4)   review and modify existing State regulations adopted under, and for the purposes of, the States school meals programs, as necessary to authorize and facilitate the use of existing funds and other available resources for the purpose of promoting, encouraging, and facilitating the development of more productive and longer-term food procurement arrangements between school food authorities, food service management companies, and local and regional farmers, ranchers, and other food producers and production systems, particularly those located in New Jersey; and (5)   take other appropriate actions to promote, encourage, and facilitate the increased procurement and use, by schools, school districts, school food authorities, food service management companies, and other third-party food service vendors, and the increased distribution to students, for school meals program purposes, of foods, food products, and ingredients produced by local and regional farmers, ranchers, and other food producers and food production systems, particularly those located in New Jersey. 3.    The Secretary of Agriculture and the Commissioner of Education shall each adopt rules and regulations, in cooperation and consultation with each other and pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act.  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum, define the physical boundaries or identify other criteria to be used, by the Departments of Agriculture and Education, and by school food authorities, food service management companies, and other third-party food vendors throughout the State, in determining whether food, food products, or ingredients are produced on a local or regional basis, for the purposes of providing for the increased and expanded procurement thereof, for school meals program purposes, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Any definitions or boundaries established, pursuant to this subsection, shall be consistent with relevant definitions and boundaries established, by the United States Department of Agriculture or the United States Department of Education, in association with the implementation of federal farm-to-school initiatives. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education, working in cooperation and consultation with one another, to establish and implement a Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, not more than 180 days after the bills effective date.  The purpose and goals of the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative would be to promote and facilitate the increased and expanded procurement and use, by school food authorities, and by associated food service management corporations and other third-party food vendors, for school meals program purposes, and the increased selection by students, for daily consumption under the States school meals programs, of locally and regionally produced foods, food products, and ingredients, particularly, those produced by farmers, ranchers, and other food producers or production systems in New Jersey. This legislation is intended both to increase student awareness regarding the availability and benefits of procuring and consuming foods that are grown and produced, from the land, by individual farmers, ranchers, and other food producers in the local and regional area, and to encourage the increased purchasing and consumption, by students, of these types of locally and regionally produced, land-derived foods, as an alternative to other types of foods commonly sold by supermarkets, corner stores, and drive-through establishments.  By putting a local face to the food students are eating, the State can more directly show students the benefits of eating locally and regionally grown foods, and can better demonstrate how the use of money to purchase goods produced by such local and regional farmers, ranchers, and other, similar land-based food producers can ultimately help local communities thrive.
