(cf: P.L.1990, c.52, s.66) 9.  Section 18 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-15) is amended to read as follows: 18.  In any year, no district shall be required to make expenditures for the purposes of [this act] P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-1 et seq.) in excess of the maximum per service aid amount [of State aid received pursuant to this act] determined by the commissioner pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-9) for that year. (cf: P.L.1997, c.192, s.18) 10.  The following are repealed: Sections 15 through 17 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-12 through C.18A:46A-14); and Section 19 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-16). 11.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the laws governing the allocation of State aid for auxiliary services and remedial services to nonpublic school students. The bill specifically requires the Commissioner of Education to establish a process by which school districts are to be reimbursed for costs that are incurred to provide auxiliary and remedial services for eligible nonpublic school students.  Under the bill, school districts are to be reimbursed for costs within the limits of applicable maximum per service aid amounts, as established by the commissioner.  The maximum per service aid amounts established by the commissioner would be based on projected estimates, for the upcoming school year, of the number of: services to be provided; students eligible for each service; and the costs to provide the services.  The estimates used by the commissioner to establish the maximum per service aid amounts are to be based on trends from recent school years in the number of services provided, eligible students, and service costs.  The method by which the commissioner establishes the maximum per service aid amounts is required to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, the amounts annually appropriated for auxiliary services and remedial services are fully exhausted by the end of the school year for which the maximum amounts are established. The reimbursement process to be implemented by the commissioner pursuant to the bill would permit school districts to apply monthly for reimbursement payments.  The details of the reimbursement process are to be annually announced on July 15 prior to the beginning of the school year, and districts can begin submitting for reimbursement on September 1.  Reimbursements are to be made to school districts throughout the school year until the full amount annually appropriated as State aid for nonpublic school auxiliary and remedial services has been fully expended. School districts seeking reimbursement under the bill are to submit applications on a monthly basis and adhere to all established submission guidelines, accounting and budgeting guidance, documentation requirements, and defined timelines for reimbursement. In order to ensure the full reimbursement of eligible costs, the bill also removes provisions of law setting forth the calculation of both categories of aid.  Under current law, State aid allotments for an upcoming school year are calculated by multiplying the applicable per pupil service cost by the number of students who were previously identified as eligible to receive each service. The bill also removes sections of current law that: 1) require school districts to refund unexpended State aid for nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services; and 2) require the commissioner to prorate State nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services aid amounts downward, in the event that the amount of State aid appropriated for those purposes is insufficient.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.192, s.18) 10.  The following are repealed: Sections 15 through 17 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-12 through C.18A:46A-14); and Section 19 of P.L.1977, c.192 (C.18A:46A-16). 11.  This act shall take effect immediately and shall first apply to the first full school year following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the laws governing the allocation of State aid for auxiliary services and remedial services to nonpublic school students. The bill specifically requires the Commissioner of Education to establish a process by which school districts are to be reimbursed for costs that are incurred to provide auxiliary and remedial services for eligible nonpublic school students.  Under the bill, school districts are to be reimbursed for costs within the limits of applicable maximum per service aid amounts, as established by the commissioner.  The maximum per service aid amounts established by the commissioner would be based on projected estimates, for the upcoming school year, of the number of: services to be provided; students eligible for each service; and the costs to provide the services.  The estimates used by the commissioner to establish the maximum per service aid amounts are to be based on trends from recent school years in the number of services provided, eligible students, and service costs.  The method by which the commissioner establishes the maximum per service aid amounts is required to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, the amounts annually appropriated for auxiliary services and remedial services are fully exhausted by the end of the school year for which the maximum amounts are established. The reimbursement process to be implemented by the commissioner pursuant to the bill would permit school districts to apply monthly for reimbursement payments.  The details of the reimbursement process are to be annually announced on July 15 prior to the beginning of the school year, and districts can begin submitting for reimbursement on September 1.  Reimbursements are to be made to school districts throughout the school year until the full amount annually appropriated as State aid for nonpublic school auxiliary and remedial services has been fully expended. School districts seeking reimbursement under the bill are to submit applications on a monthly basis and adhere to all established submission guidelines, accounting and budgeting guidance, documentation requirements, and defined timelines for reimbursement. In order to ensure the full reimbursement of eligible costs, the bill also removes provisions of law setting forth the calculation of both categories of aid.  Under current law, State aid allotments for an upcoming school year are calculated by multiplying the applicable per pupil service cost by the number of students who were previously identified as eligible to receive each service. The bill also removes sections of current law that: 1) require school districts to refund unexpended State aid for nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services; and 2) require the commissioner to prorate State nonpublic auxiliary and remedial services aid amounts downward, in the event that the amount of State aid appropriated for those purposes is insufficient.
