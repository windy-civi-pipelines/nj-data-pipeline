to fulfill the balance within this 90 business day period, the bidder shall
forfeit the deposit on the property and shall be responsible for the payment of

property or the financial institution denying financing, in which case the

tenant for the initial sale of the foreclosed upon property, unless the sale is
delayed or postponed, upon which the foreclosed upon defendant, next of kin of
