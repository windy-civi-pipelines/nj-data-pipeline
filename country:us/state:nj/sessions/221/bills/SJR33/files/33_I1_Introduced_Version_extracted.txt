However, despite federal law to expand the availability of service dogs to veterans, the training and placement of service dogs falls primarily upon community non-profit organizations that depend on charitable donations, such as Paws Healing Heroes of Glassboro.  The average cost to rescue, train, and present a service dog to a veteran can be $3,000 to $5,000, which is not covered by insurance or other veterans benefits. Designating Paws Healing Heroes Day will promote greater awareness of the unique role of service dogs in assisting veterans.
