Current law does not establish a uniform societal benefits charge rate for all electric and gas public utilities.  Each electric and gas public utility determines, with the approval of the Board of Public Utilities, a rate for each component (i.e., utility assistance programs or manufactured gas plant remediation) to be funded through the societal benefits charge.  The bill requires the report to also include information regarding the total societal benefit charge rate, and each component of the societal benefits charge rate, for each electric and gas public utility and the amount or societal benefits charge revenue retained by each electric and gas public utility.
