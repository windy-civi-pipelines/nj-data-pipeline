STATEMENT This bill would require certain businesses to submit an excess food reduction plan to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and would provide a tax credit under the corporation business tax to eligible businesses that reduce excess food by 25 percent. Specifically, this bill would require, within one year of the bills effective date, a business within the State that caters or orders food for employees or clients, or to host events, to submit an excess food reduction plan to the DEP for approval.  The excess food reduction plan would be required to include, at a minimum, procedures that the business will utilize to: (1) reduce the amount of excess food generated as a result of catering or ordering food for employees or clients, or to host events; (2) limit the ordering or catering of food to amounts that are necessary and not excessive; (3) improve methods of providing food to employees, to clients, or during events by reducing the provision of self-service food so that excess food may be reused or donated; (4) minimize the disposal of excess food to landfills or incinerators; and (5) increase the use of alternate methods for the disposition of excess food generated, including composting and food donation. No later than 90 days after receipt of an excess food reduction plan, the DEP would be required to make a determination to approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan with conditions, or disapprove the plan.  If an excess food reduction plan is disapproved, the business would be required to resubmit a revised excess food reduction plan to the DEP.  After receiving approval from the DEP, the business would be required to proceed with the implementation of the excess food reduction plan.  Under the bill, certain public institutions of higher education would not be required to submit an excess food reduction plan to the DEP if the public institution of higher education is already required to submit a food waste reduction plan that is substantially similar to the excess food reduction plan established by the bill. The bill would also allow a taxpayer that owns or operates a business in this State and that demonstrates a 25 percent reduction in excess food by composting, recycling, or donating excess food rather than disposing of the excess food at a landfill or incinerator to receive a corporation business tax credit to compensate the taxpayer for certain costs incurred in the alternate disposal of excess food. The amount of the tax credit would not exceed the lesser of: (1) the total costs associated with the alternate disposition of excess food through composting, recycling at an authorized food waste recycling facility, or food donation rather than disposal in a landfill or incinerator; or (2) $2,500. To qualify for a tax credit under the bill, a taxpayer would be required apply to the Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner) for a certification that provides that the taxpayers business reduction in excess food is eligible for the tax credit.  The application to the commissioner is required to demonstrate that the taxpayers business reduced excess food by 25 percent through the alternate disposition of excess food using composting, recycling, or food donation rather than disposal in a landfill or incinerator prior to applying for the tax credit and that the taxpayer has not received any other corporation business tax credit for a reduction in food waste or excess food. The bill would require, no later than one year after the expiration date of the tax credits provided pursuant to the bill, the commissioner to prepare and submit to the Governor, the State Treasurer, and the Legislature, a report that, at a minimum, summarizes the effectiveness of the tax credit in reducing excess food at businesses throughout the State and in incentivizing the alternate disposition of excess food through composting, recycling, or food donation rather than disposal in a landfill or incinerator. Finally, the bill would also authorize the department to impose a fee at the time an excess food reduction plan is submitted to the department and an application fee at the time a taxpayer applies to the commissioner for a certification that provides that the taxpayers business reduction in excess food is eligible for the tax credit provided pursuant to the bill.  The amount of the fee and application fee are required to cover the administrative costs of the department in reviewing the excess food reduction plans and tax credit applications.  Under the bill, the amount of the tax credit awarded to a taxpayer may also be utilized to reimburse a taxpayer for fees submitted to the department.
