or (2)  the beneficiary has an increased likelihood of a high-risk pregnancy due to: (a)  pre-existing medical conditions, which shall include, but shall not be limited to: HIV or AIDS, diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, obesity, or polycystic ovary syndrome; (b)  age at the time of pregnancy, including beneficiaries between the ages of ten and 19, and those aged 35 years and older; (c)  lifestyle factors, including the beneficiarys use of alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs during pregnancy;

STATEMENT This bill establishes a voluntary, three-year pilot program to provide certain pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries with remote maternal health services, upon referral by the beneficiaries health care provider.  It is the intent of the bills sponsor to expand access to obstetric care for pregnant patients who live in the States rural communities or in medically underserved communities. The bill provides that the Commissioner of Human Services, based upon clinical evidence and the recommendations of experts in the fields of obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine, will determine the remote services to be provided through the pilot program.  At minimum, the program will provide remote patient monitoring, remote non-stress tests, and tele-ultrasound services for pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries.  The bill defines remote maternal health services as the use of digital technology to collect medical and health data from a pregnant patient and securely transmit this information to a health care provider at a distant site for interpretation and use as part of a diagnosis or a treatment plan.  Remote patient monitoring is defined as the use of digital technology to collect and transmit patient health data to a healthcare provider at a distant site for review and treatment management. The bill stipulates that the devices and digital technologies used to provide remote maternal health services must comply with the requirements of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and be used in an FDA-approved capacity. The bill provides that State licensed physicians, certified nurse midwives, professional midwives, or midwives may refer a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary to the pilot program if the health care provider determines that remote maternal health services are in the beneficiarys best interests; or that the beneficiary has an increased likelihood of a high-risk pregnancy due to: pre-existing medical conditions; age; lifestyle factors; or a diagnosed pregnancy-related condition, such as preeclampsia. The bill also provides that remote maternal health services will be available to a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary whose pregnancy is not high-risk, but who resides in a community that lacks a sufficient number of health care providers who offer obstetric care and participate in the Medicaid program.  Eligibility for the pilot program will also be extended to a pregnant Medicaid beneficiary who is unable to access consistent obstetric care due to socioeconomic factors, such as the beneficiarys work schedule, a lack of reliable transportation, or a lack of reliable child care. Pursuant to the bill, the establishment of the remote maternal health services pilot program is contingent upon federal approval of the States Medicaid waiver application or State plan amendment, in order to ensure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program.
