years from the date of his most recent conviction, payment of fine,
satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration,
whichever is later. The term &quot;fine&quot; as used herein and throughout
this section means and includes any fine, restitution, and other court-ordered
financial assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the
conviction, for which payment of restitution takes precedence in accordance
with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.  The person shall
submit the expungement application to the Superior Court in the county in which
the <u>most recent criminal</u> conviction <span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span>for
the crime<span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span>

conviction, or convictions if applicable, and all records and information
pertaining thereto be expunged.  The petition for each conviction appended to

concerning the six-year time requirement, if a fine which is currently subject
to collection under the comprehensive enforcement program established pursuant
to P.L.1995, c.9 (C.2B:19-1 et al.) is not yet satisfied due to reasons other
than willful noncompliance, but the time requirement of six years is otherwise
satisfied, the person may submit the expungement application and the court may
grant an expungement, provided, however, that if expungement is granted under
this paragraph, the court shall provide for the continued collection of any
outstanding amount owed that is necessary to satisfy the fine or the entry of
civil judgment for the outstanding amount in accordance with section 8 of
P.L.2017, c.244 (C.2C:52-23.1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, an application
may be filed and presented, and the court may grant an expungement pursuant to
this section, although less than six years have expired in accordance with the
time requirements when the court finds:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the fine is satisfied
but less than six years have expired from the date of satisfaction, and the
time requirement of six years is otherwise satisfied, and the court finds that
the person substantially complied with any payment plan ordered pursuant to
N.J.S.2C:46-1 et seq., or could not do so due to compelling circumstances
affecting his ability to satisfy the fine; or</p>
