The person, if eligible, may present the expungement application after the expiration of a period of six years from the date of his most recent conviction, payment of fine, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later. The term "fine" as used herein and throughout this section means and includes any fine, restitution, and other court-ordered financial assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the conviction, for which payment of restitution takes precedence in accordance with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.  The person shall submit the expungement application to the Superior Court in the county in which the most recent criminal conviction [for the crime] was adjudged, which contains a separate, duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 for each conviction sought to be expunged, praying that the conviction, or convictions if applicable, and all records and information pertaining thereto be expunged.  The petition for each conviction appended to an application shall comply with the requirements set forth in N.J.S.2C:52-1 et seq.

"Sealing" refers to the relief previously granted pursuant to P.L.1973, c.191 (C.2A:85-15 et seq.).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   )   (pending before the Legislature as this bill) c.     In those instances where a person has received a dismissal of a criminal charge because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or any other diversion program, a statement with affidavit or verification setting forth the nature of the original charge, the court of disposition and date of disposition. (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.4) 6.    N.J.S.2C:52-14 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-14.  A petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be denied when: a.     Any statutory prerequisite, including any provision of this chapter, is not fulfilled or there is any other statutory basis for denying relief. b.    The need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having a person freed from any disabilities as otherwise provided in this chapter.  An application may be denied under this subsection only following objection of a party given notice pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-10 and the burden of asserting such grounds shall be on the objector [, except that in regard to expungement sought for third or fourth degree drug offenses pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2, the court shall consider whether this factor applies regardless of whether any party objects on this basis]. c.     In connection with a petition under N.J.S.2C:52-6, the acquittal, discharge or dismissal of charges resulted from a plea bargaining agreement involving the conviction of other charges.  This bar, however, shall not apply once the conviction is itself expunged. d.    The arrest or conviction sought to be expunged is, at the time of hearing, the subject matter of civil litigation between the petitioner or his legal representative and the State, any governmental entity thereof or any State agency and the representatives or employees of any such body. e.     [A person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged regardless of the lapse of time between the prior expungement, or sealing under prior law, and the present petition. This provision shall not apply: (1)   When the person is seeking the expungement of a municipal ordinance violation or, (2)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-6.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2017, c.244) (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.5) 7.    N.J.S.2C:52-32 is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately, and apply to any expungement relief granted to any person thereafter, regardless of whether that person was previously granted an expungement. STATEMENT This bill would expand, in several ways, expungement eligibility to allow more persons to petition the Superior Court for expungement relief: - It would eliminate the cap on the number of convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses that a person could expunge; - It would eliminate the limitation on the number of times a person could be granted expungement relief based on convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses; - It would allow for convictions of first degree and second degree crimes for the sale or distribution of any form of controlled dangerous substance to be expunged, if the court found that the expungement is consistent with the public interest (such expungements are only currently permitted for convictions of either the third degree or fourth degree crime); - It would allow a so-called young drug offender (a person who is 21 years of age or younger at the time of committing the offense), who is eligible for expedited expungement relief under current law (see N.J.S.2C:52-5), to be granted such expedited relief even if that offender had violated a condition of probation or parole, has on record a conviction for another crime or violation of the States drug laws, or had a previous criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program; and It would repeal N.J.S.2C:52-32, which expresses the current State policy favoring limitations on the availability of expungement relief based on the number of convictions a person has or the number of times expungement relief was previously sought.

The person, if eligible, may present the expungement application after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of his most recent conviction, payment of fine, satisfactory completion of probation or release from incarceration, whichever is later.  The term "fine" as used herein and throughout this section means and includes any fine, restitution, and other court-ordered financial assessment imposed by the court as part of the sentence for the conviction, for which payment of restitution takes precedence in accordance with chapter 46 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.  The person shall submit the expungement application to the Superior Court in the county in which the most recent conviction for a disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offense was adjudged, which contains a separate, duly verified petition as provided in N.J.S.2C:52-7 for each conviction sought to be expunged, praying that the conviction, or convictions if applicable, and all records and information pertaining thereto be expunged.  The petition for each conviction appended to an application shall comply with the requirements of N.J.S.2C:52-1 et seq.      Notwithstanding the provisions of the five-year time requirement, an application may be filed and presented, and the court may grant an expungement pursuant to this section, when the court finds: (1)   the fine is satisfied but less than five years have expired from the date of satisfaction, and the five-year time requirement is otherwise satisfied, and the court finds that the person substantially complied with any payment plan ordered pursuant to N.J.S.2C:46-1 et seq., or could not do so due to compelling circumstances affecting his ability to satisfy the fine; or (2) at least three but less than five years have expired from the date of the most recent conviction, payment of fine, satisfactory completion of probation or parole, or release from incarceration, whichever is later; and the person has not been otherwise convicted of a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense since the time of the most recent conviction; and the court finds in its discretion that expungement is in the public interest, giving due consideration to the nature of the offense or offenses, and the applicant's character and conduct since the conviction or convictions. In determining whether compelling circumstances exist for the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court may consider the amount of the fine or fines imposed, the person's age at the time of the offense or offenses, the person's financial condition and other relevant circumstances regarding the person's ability to pay. (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.2) 3.    N.J.S.2C:52-4 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-4.     Ordinances.     In all cases wherein a person has been found guilty of violating a municipal ordinance of any governmental entity of this State [and who has not been convicted of] notwithstanding any prior or subsequent conviction for a crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense, whether within this State or any other jurisdiction, [and who has not been adjudged a disorderly person or petty  disorderly person on more than two occasions,] may, after the expiration of a period of [2] two years from the date of his conviction, payment of fine, satisfactory completion of probation or release from incarceration, whichever is later, present a duly verified petition as provided in [section] N.J.S.2C:52-7 [herein] to the Superior Court in the county in which the violation occurred praying that such conviction and all records and information pertaining thereto  be expunged.

Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.2C:52-2 and N.J.S.2C:52-3, after a period of not less than one year following conviction, termination of probation or parole or discharge from custody, whichever is later, any person convicted of an offense under chapter 35 or 36 of this title for the possession or use of a controlled dangerous substance, convicted of violating P.L.1955, c.77, s.3 (C.2A:170-77.5), or convicted of violating P.L.1962, c.113, s.1 (C.2A:170-77.8), and who at the time of the offense was 21 years of age or younger, may apply to the Superior Court in the county wherein the matter was disposed of for the expungement of such person's conviction and all records pertaining thereto.  [The relief of expungement under this section shall be granted only if said person has not, prior to the time of hearing, violated any of the conditions of his probation or parole, albeit subsequent to discharge from probation or parole, has not been convicted of any previous or subsequent criminal act or any subsequent or previous violation of chapter 35 or 36 of this title or of P.L.1955, c.277, s.3 (C.2A:170-77.5) or of P.L.1962, c.113, s.1 (C.2A:170-77.8), or who has not had a prior or subsequent criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program.] This section shall not apply to any person who has been convicted of the sale or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance or possession with the intent to sell any controlled dangerous substance except: (1)   Marihuana, where the total sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was less than one ounce, or (2)   Hashish, where the total amount sold, distributed or possessed with intent to sell was less than five grams. (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.3) 5.    N.J.S.2C:52-8 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-8.     Statements to accompany petition.  There shall be attached to a petition for expungement: a.     A statement with the affidavit or verification that there are no disorderly persons, petty disorderly persons or criminal charges pending against the petitioner at the time of filing of the petition for expungement. b.    [In those instances where the petitioner is seeking the expungement of a criminal conviction, or the expungement of convictions pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-3 for multiple disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses, all of which were entered the same day, or which were interdependent or closely related in circumstances and were committed as part of a sequence of events that took place within a comparatively short period of time, a statement with affidavit or verification that he has never been granted expungement, sealing or similar relief regarding a criminal conviction or convictions for multiple disorderly persons or petty disorderly persons offenses, all of which were entered the same day, or which were interdependent or closely related in circumstances and were committed as part of a sequence of events that took place within a comparatively short period of time by any court in this State or other state or by any Federal court. "Sealing" refers to the relief previously granted pursuant to P.L.1973, c.191 (C.2A:85-15 et seq.).] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   )   (pending before the Legislature as this bill) c.     In those instances where a person has received a dismissal of a criminal charge because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or any other diversion program, a statement with affidavit or verification setting forth the nature of the original charge, the court of disposition and date of disposition. (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.4) 6.    N.J.S.2C:52-14 is amended to read as follows: 2C:52-14.  A petition for expungement filed pursuant to this chapter shall be denied when: a.     Any statutory prerequisite, including any provision of this chapter, is not fulfilled or there is any other statutory basis for denying relief. b.    The need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of having a person freed from any disabilities as otherwise provided in this chapter.  An application may be denied under this subsection only following objection of a party given notice pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-10 and the burden of asserting such grounds shall be on the objector [, except that in regard to expungement sought for third or fourth degree drug offenses pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2, the court shall consider whether this factor applies regardless of whether any party objects on this basis]. c.     In connection with a petition under N.J.S.2C:52-6, the acquittal, discharge or dismissal of charges resulted from a plea bargaining agreement involving the conviction of other charges.  This bar, however, shall not apply once the conviction is itself expunged. d.    The arrest or conviction sought to be expunged is, at the time of hearing, the subject matter of civil litigation between the petitioner or his legal representative and the State, any governmental entity thereof or any State agency and the representatives or employees of any such body. e.     [A person has had a previous criminal conviction expunged regardless of the lapse of time between the prior expungement, or sealing under prior law, and the present petition. This provision shall not apply: (1)   When the person is seeking the expungement of a municipal ordinance violation or, (2)   When the person is seeking the expungement of records pursuant to N.J.S.2C:52-6.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2017, c.244) (cf: P.L.2017, c.244, s.5) 7.    N.J.S.2C:52-32 is repealed. 8.    This act shall take effect immediately, and apply to any expungement relief granted to any person thereafter, regardless of whether that person was previously granted an expungement. STATEMENT This bill would expand, in several ways, expungement eligibility to allow more persons to petition the Superior Court for expungement relief: - It would eliminate the cap on the number of convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses that a person could expunge; - It would eliminate the limitation on the number of times a person could be granted expungement relief based on convictions for crimes, disorderly persons offenses, and petty disorderly persons offenses; - It would allow for convictions of first degree and second degree crimes for the sale or distribution of any form of controlled dangerous substance to be expunged, if the court found that the expungement is consistent with the public interest (such expungements are only currently permitted for convictions of either the third degree or fourth degree crime); - It would allow a so-called young drug offender (a person who is 21 years of age or younger at the time of committing the offense), who is eligible for expedited expungement relief under current law (see N.J.S.2C:52-5), to be granted such expedited relief even if that offender had violated a condition of probation or parole, has on record a conviction for another crime or violation of the States drug laws, or had a previous criminal matter dismissed because of acceptance into a supervisory treatment or other diversion program; and It would repeal N.J.S.2C:52-32, which expresses the current State policy favoring limitations on the availability of expungement relief based on the number of convictions a person has or the number of times expungement relief was previously sought.
