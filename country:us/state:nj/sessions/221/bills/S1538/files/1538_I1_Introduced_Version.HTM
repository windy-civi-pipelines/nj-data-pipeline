appropriate enforcement methods to collect child support arrearage have been
exhausted and</u> the child support arrearage equals or exceeds the amount of
child support payable for six months or court-ordered health care coverage for

and regular mail, return receipt requested<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>

obligor's license may be revoked or suspended unless, within 30 days of the
postmark date of the notice, the obligor pays the full amount of the child
support arrearage, or provides proof that health care coverage for the child
has been obtained, or responds to a subpoena, or makes a written request for a
court hearing to the Probation Division<u>, or reaches an agreement with the

effective, the Probation Division <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>shall<b><span

the obligor was effective as set forth in this section, it shall without</p>

written notice to the most recent residential or employer address filed with
the Probation Division for that party.  If a party fails to respond to a notice
and no proof is available that the party received the notice, the Probation
Division shall document to the court that it has made a diligent effort to
locate the party by making inquiries that may include, but are not limited to:
the United States Postal Service, the <b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Division

adverse action is taken based upon the party's failure to respond to the notice.</p>

a hearing, the Probation Division shall file a petition for a judicial hearing
in accordance with section 5 of P.L.1996, c.7 (C.2A:17-56.43).  The hearing
shall occur within 45 days of the obligor's request.  If, at or prior to the
hearing, the obligor pays the full amount of the child support arrearage or
provides health care coverage as ordered, or responds to the subpoena <b><span

motion to modify the child support order if that motion was filed prior to the
date that the notice of the license suspension or revocation was sent by the
Probation Division.  The court shall consider the Probation Division's petition

for six months or court-ordered health care coverage for the child is not
provided for six months.  The amendment further expressly permits an obligor to
reach an agreement with the Probation Division on a payment amount that is

payments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 2 amends
N.J.S.A.2A:17-56.43 concerned with suspension, revocation of license, to give

the court discretion to allow the obligor to pay a lump sum, in lieu of 25% of
the past due child support amount, within a time frame not to exceed ten days,
instead of three days of the hearing, over a longer period of five years,
instead of one year to satisfy the remainder of the arrearage.  The amendment
permits both an extension and modification of the payment plan, upon a showing
of good cause. Further, the amendment deletes the provision of N.J.S.A.2A:17-56.41
that provides a payment plan shall not extend beyond the date the dependent
child reaches the age of 18, permitting a longer repayment period, in some
instances.</p>

delete language permitting denial, suspension or revocation of the driver's
license and professional or occupational licenses, or recreational or sporting
license held or applied for if a warrant for the obligor's arrest has been
issued by the court due to failure to pay child support as ordered, failure to
appear at a hearing to establish paternity or child support, or failure to
appear at a hearing to enforce a child support order and said warrant remains
outstanding. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4 amends N.J.S.2A:17.56.44

certifications required by licensing authorities, including that the applicant
is not the subject of a child-support related warrant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5 amends
N.J.S.A.56:11-31 concerned with furnishing of consumer report; permissible
circumstances.  The amendment deletes the requirement that 10 days notice has
