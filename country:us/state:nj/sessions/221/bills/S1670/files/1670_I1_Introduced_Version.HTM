<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.54:3-26 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54:3-26.  <u>a.</u>  The
county board of taxation shall hear and determine all such appeals within
three  months after the last day for filing such appeals, and shall keep a
record of its judgments thereon in permanent form, and shall transmit a written
memorandum of its judgments to the assessor of the taxing district and to the
taxpayer, setting forth the reasons on which such judgment was based, and in
all cases where the amount of tax to be paid shall be changed as the result of 
an appeal, to the collector of the taxing district.  The Director of the
Division of Taxation shall prescribe such procedures and forms for the setting 
forth of such written memorandums of judgments as may be necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever any review is sought
of the determination of the county board of taxation, the complaint shall
contain a copy of the memorandum of judgment of the county board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.</u>    Where no request
for review is taken to the Tax Court to review the action or determination of
the county board involving real property the judgment of the county board shall
be conclusive and binding upon the municipal assessor and the taxing district for
the assessment year, and for the two assessment years succeeding the assessment
year, covered by the judgment, except as to changes in value of the property
occurring after the assessment date.  The  conclusive and binding effect of
such judgment shall terminate with the tax year immediately preceding the year
in which a program for a complete revaluation or complete reassessment of all
real property within the district has been put into effect <u>or when the
assessor implements either a reassessment or other form of district-wide
assessment review that requires the revision of all property assessments to
current market value, which assessment is approved by the county board of
taxation and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury</u>.  If as of October 1 of the pretax year, the property in question
has been the subject of an addition qualifying as an added assessment, a
condominium or cooperative conversion, a subdivision or a zoning change, the
conclusive and binding effect of such judgment shall terminate with said pretax
year.</p>

the judgment of the county board was rendered, and if said judgment is a final
judgment not further appealed, the burden of proof shall be on the taxing
district to establish that the assessor acted reasonably in increasing the
assessment.  If the county board finds that the assessor did not act reasonably
in increasing the assessment or failed to reflect said judgment on the tax
duplicate, the county board shall award to the taxpayer reasonable counsel
fees, appraisal costs and other costs which shall be paid by the taxing

the county board of taxation and the Director of the Division of Taxation in
the Department of the Treasury pursuant to R.S.54:4-23, the assessors increase
of an appeal judgment shall be limited to the percentage increase of the net
valuation taxable of the district.  The maximum percentage increase shall be
calculated by utilizing the net valuation taxable of the district from the
prior years abstract of ratables and the total net valuation taxable from the districts
current years preliminary tax list or tax list, as appropriate. If as of
October 1 of the pretax year, the property in question has been the subject of
an addition qualifying as an added assessment, a condominium or cooperative
conversion, a subdivision or a zoning change, the conclusive and binding effect
of such judgment shall terminate with said pretax year.</u></p>

increases the assessment of an appeal judgment in excess of the permitted
percentage allowed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the burden of
proof shall be on the taxing district to establish that the assessor acted
reasonably in increasing the assessment. If the county board finds that the
assessor did not act reasonably in increasing the assessment or failed to
reflect said judgment on the tax duplicate, the county board shall award to the
taxpayer reasonable counsel fees, appraisal costs and other costs which shall

district which has implemented a district-wide reassessment program or other
form of district-wide assessment review that requires the revision of all
property assessments to current market value, that is approved by the county
board of taxation and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury pursuant to R.S.54:4-23, the assessors increase of an
appeal judgment shall be limited to the percentage increase of the net
valuation taxable of the district.  The maximum percentage increase shall be
calculated by utilizing the net valuation taxable of the district from the
prior years abstract of ratables and the net valuation taxable from the districts
current years preliminary tax list or tax list, as appropriate. If as of
October 1 of the pretax year, the property in question has been the subject of
an addition qualifying as an added assessment, a condominium or cooperative
conversion, a subdivision or a zoning change, the conclusive and binding effect
of such judgment shall terminate with said pretax year.</u></p>

increases the assessment of an appeal judgment in excess of the permitted
percentage allowed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the burden of

reasonably in increasing the assessment. If the county board finds that the
assessor did not act reasonably in increasing the assessment or failed to
reflect said judgment on the tax duplicate, the county board shall award to the
taxpayer reasonable counsel fees, appraisal costs and other costs which shall
be paid by the taxing district.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies existing
law regarding the freeze of property tax assessment appeal judgments within taxing
districts performing a review and revision of all property to current market
value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law appeal
judgments on property tax assessments terminate with the tax year immediately
preceding the year in which a program for a complete revaluation or complete
reassessment of all real property within the district has been put into effect.
This bill also allows a termination of property tax assessment appeal judgments
in districts performing a review and revision of all property to current market
value, but limits the tax increase to the year over year increase in the districts
net taxable value of property. The net valuation taxable is the total value of
all taxable property in a taxing district. The limiting effect is to honor the
property tax proportionate share established by the appeal judgment and ensure
fair levy distribution in the subsequent year through the capture of common
appreciation of property value. </p>
