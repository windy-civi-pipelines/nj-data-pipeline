The decision of a county, municipality or contracting unit to allow its employees to waive coverage and the amount of consideration to be paid therefor shall not be subject to the collective bargaining process. Commencing on the effective date of P.L.    , c.        (pending before the Legislature as this bill), an elected public official shall not be eligible to receive any payment in accordance with this section for waiving coverage under the countys, municipalitys, or contracting units plan to which the elected public official is entitled by virtue of the office held, including any elected public official who waived coverage prior to the effective date.

(cf: P.L.2010, c.2, s.11) 4.  (New section)   a.  The State Treasurer shall establish a Pension Fraud and Abuse Unit within the Department of the Treasury.  The unit shall be dedicated to the prevention and investigation of fraud and abuse of the States pension and benefits systems, including the payment of retirement, disability, and other benefits. b.  The Director of the Pension Fraud and Abuse Unit shall report directly to the State Treasurer, and the State Treasurer shall appoint or assign such accountants, investigators, and other employees to the unit as necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the unit. c.  The unit shall: (1)  investigate public pension claims and payments, including, but not limited to, disability pension claims, and claims of improper participation in the retirement systems, as well as potential fraud and abuse of other benefit systems as the State Treasurer may direct; (2)  work closely and coordinate with both the Division of Pensions and Benefits within the department and the Office of the Attorney General and receive referrals from the Office of the State Comptroller on claims of potential fraud and abuse; (3)  work closely with the Division of Pensions and Benefits, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Office of the State Comptroller to identify cases of suspected pension fraud, abuse, and ineligibility, and undertake investigations, share information and resources, develop strategies for curtailing fraud and abuse, and identify cases for civil and criminal prosecution; and (4)  hold regular meetings with the Division of Pensions and Benefits, Office of the Attorney  General, and the Office of the State Comptroller to ensure the maximum cooperation between these agencies. d.  The unit may recommend all civil or criminal remedies as may be provided by law to address such pension fraud, abuse, and improper participation, and, in conjunction with the Division of Pensions and Benefits and the Office of the Attorney General, and as provided by law, may pursue such petitioning of the appropriate boards as necessary for denial of an application or revocation of a pension or benefit improperly granted, and may refer matters to the Division of Pensions and Benefits, the Office of the Attorney General, and other State agencies as appropriate for further action. e.  The unit shall encourage the public to report fraudulent pension and benefit claims and payments and shall maintain a website, mailing address, facsimile, electronic mail address, toll-free number, and other methods to receive such reports at the discretion of the director. f.  The requests, investigations, and responses of the unit shall remain confidential until such time as the matter is presented to the respective board of trustees for consideration or any criminal action is completed.  Disclosure of existence of an investigation to the subject of the investigation shall be expressly prohibited. Any records, documents, videos, and voice recordings obtained by the unit during an investigation are considered privileged and confidential during the pendency of the investigation. g.  The unit is authorized to call upon the expertise and assistance of all State departments, divisions, offices, or agencies, as well as all political subdivisions of the State, to carry out its mission, duties, and responsibilities, including, but not limited to, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of the Treasury, the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, and the Office of the Attorney General. h.  The unit may subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, and also may require, by subpoena, the production of books, papers, documents, or other evidence in any matter involving the units investigation of fraud and abuse of the States pension and benefits systems, including the payment of retirement, disability, and other benefits. If any person shall refuse to obey any subpoena so issued, or shall refuse to testify or produce any books, papers, documents, or other evidence, the unit may apply ex parte to the Superior Court to compel the person to comply forthwith with the subpoena. i.  All departments, divisions, offices, agencies, and political subdivisions of the State shall, to the extent not inconsistent with law, cooperate with the unit and furnish the unit with information upon request by the unit. 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill limits eligibility for health care benefits coverage for elected public officials of a municipality or county to those elected public officials whose hours of work are fixed at 35 or more per week.  This limitations applies to counties and municipality that do not participate in the New Jersey State Health Benefits Program (SHBP).  The limitation is the same as the current eligibility requirement for health care benefits coverage in the SHBP.  Elected public officials currently receiving health care benefits coverage may continue to receive such coverage as long as they remain eligible prior to the effective date of the bill and continuously thereafter. The bill also makes elected public officials who choose to waive health care benefits coverage ineligible for payments for such a waiver.  Such payments are currently permitted for certain public employees by public employers that participate and that do not participate in the SHBP. This bill codifies the Pension Fraud and Abuse Unit (PFAU) within the Department of the Treasury, which was established by executive order in 2013 to prevent and investigate cases of intentional deception or misrepresentation that result in an unauthorized benefit to a member or to some other person from the State-administered retirement systems and benefits programs.  This includes, but is not limited to, disability pension claims and improper participation in the retirement systems and other benefit programs. This bill also provides subpoena power to the PFAU to assist the unit during investigations. According to an investigative report issued by the State Comptroller, the PFAU has inadequate statutory authority to compel public employers to comply with requests for information during investigations.  Codifying the unit will result in more effective investigations.
