S2760 SENATE, No. 2760 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 15, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS New Jersey Transit Villages Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the establishment of transit villages, supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1975, c.291. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)    Sections 1 through 19 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey Transit Villages Act. 2.    (New section)    The Legislature finds and declares: a.     Historically, the relationships between land use and transportation were quite clear and efficient.  Communities were organized so that the goods that they produced could easily be shipped to others, by road, canal, river, lake, or ocean, as the particular geographical circumstances dictated.  Personal travel generally occurred by the same routes.  The relationships were based on the functional requirement of directly and efficiently moving goods and people, as well as on the limited availability of alternative modes of travel and transport. b.    As the road network began to expand throughout this State to accommodate increased automobile and truck use, the relationship between land use and transportation changed.  The proliferation of the private automobile as well as the increased number of cars per household led to the creation of new patterns and densities of development.  In the past 40 to 50 years, land use development patterns have generally taken the form of decentralized, large-lot, single use districts, connected by a maze of roadways.  Zoning and other government regulations have reinforced this trend. c.     As undeveloped land has become scarce and roadways have become more congested, people are reexamining the original land use patterns within traditional town-centered communities. In New Jersey this effort has been strongly supported by the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). The opportunity now exists to redefine and develop new patterns of development that encourage active, safe, pedestrian communities that support, and are supported by, transit. d.    The New Jersey Transit Villages Act will encourage individual municipalities to begin influencing land use patterns, densities, the general character of their communities, and eventually, the overall quality of life, while at the same time encouraging increased rider-ship on transit systems that have been the focus of major public investment. e.     Projected population increases for the State will place significant strains on the highway and road network. f.     Continuation of existing development patterns that encourage single-occupancy vehicle automobile trips, given these population increases, will lead to levels of congestion beyond the mitigation ability of the State. g.    New Jersey drivers collectively waste over 261 million hours per year sitting in traffic, negatively impacting our quality of life and losing valuable time that could be better spent with our families.  In terms of lost productivity, sitting in traffic costs each New Jersey driver nearly $1,300 per year. h.    Encouraging development and redevelopment based on smart growth principles will direct transportation investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and suburban areas, protect existing open space, conserve natural resources, increase transportation options and transit availability, reduce automobile traffic and dependency, stabilize property taxes, and provide affordable housing. i.     Efficient and compact development patterns around transit hubs will encourage transit use, thereby limiting congestion and reducing the strain on the existing road network. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the New Jersey Department of Transportation to encourage this type of development wherever possible. 3.    (New section)  As used in this act: Commissioner means the Commissioner of Transportation. Office of Smart Growth means the Office of State Planning established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-201). "Transit village" means, as designated by the commissioner, a compact, mixed-use, walkable community, centered on a mass transit hub or access point that is regularly served by a mass transit service or where there is a defined future potential that will support a transit service that, by design, increases transit ridership and reduces reliance on single-occupant vehicular transportation. "Transit village plan element" means a composite of one or more written or graphic proposals for a compact, mixed-use, walkable community, centered on a mass transit hub or access point that is regularly served by a mass transit service that is an amendment and supplement to a municipalitys master plan. "Transit village zone" means a bounded area encompassing all parcels or portions of parcels within one-half mile of a mass transit hub or access point and that is located along a mass transit route, or that is identified as having potential for transit service, as evidenced by existing or planned mixed-use development that accommodates high commercial intensities, high employment clusters, moderate to high residential density consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan as defined in the municipal zoning ordinance, and design features that promote pedestrian and bicycle circulation. 4.    (New section)    It is the intent and purpose of this act to: a.     encourage municipal action to promote intensive mixed-use development in close proximity to mass transportation services, to be known as transit villages; b.    increase transit ridership, reduce reliance on single-occupant vehicular traffic, and facilitate pedestrian, bicycle, and mass transportation trips through clustering of uses and urban design features; c.     promote residential development with a mix of housing types and a range of housing prices, including both owner-occupied housing and apartments, within transit villages; d.    improve mobility options for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit dependent people; e.     promote use of mass transportation by encouraging intermodal service and access by modes other than single-occupant vehicles; and f.    encourage the appropriate and efficient expenditure of public funds by the coordination of public development with land use policies. 5.   (New section)    a.   The municipal planning board may adopt a transit village plan element as an amendment and supplement to its master plan pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28). b.   The transit village plan element shall include a capital improvement subplan element for the plan area that provides for shared parking and reduced parking for single-occupancy vehicles within the plan area, the creation of mixed-use developments, minimum development density standards, the improvement of bicycle and pedestrian facilities, the connectivity of the street network, and measures to ensure compliance with the federal "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s. 12101 et seq.).  The capital improvement subplan element may also include a mix of infrastructure financing strategies. c.   When a municipal planning board has adopted a transit village plan element, the official map of the municipality shall be amended to reflect the provisions of that plan. d.   The transit village plan element shall include a circulation subplan element for the transit village zone pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28). 6.    (New section)    a.   The Office of Smart Growth, in consultation with the commissioner and the Executive Director of the New Jersey Transit Corporation, shall review a proposed transit village plan element and determine whether it is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. b.   Following adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance to effectuate a transit village plan element the governing body shall submit the ordinance to the commissioner for designation of the transit village zone as a transit village.  The commissioner, in consultation with the Executive Director of the New Jersey Transit Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.301 (C.27:1A-5), shall designate a transit village zone as a transit village if the commissioner determines that the plan is consistent with the provisions of this act and the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy prepared pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-22). c.     The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this section. 7.    (New section)    a.   A municipality may establish a transit village zone pursuant to a transit village plan element, in accordance with section 49 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-62). b.    Where the municipality has adopted a development transfer ordinance each transit village zone shall be designated as a receiving zone under that ordinance pursuant to P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.    (New section)    The commissioner, in consultation with the Office of Smart Growth, shall promulgate rules and regulations for administration of a transit village grant funding program.  These rules shall include but not be limited to: the criteria that a municipality shall meet in order for the Office of Smart Growth to determine that a transit village master plan element is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, adopted pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.); transit village design guidelines developed by the New Jersey Transit Corporation; and incentives and benefits associated with being designated as a transit village including, but not limited to, planning and capital funding, funding for transit planning, funding for station improvement, and prioritization for such funding. 9.    (New section)   The commissioner may enter into contracts with municipalities to maintain roads within an area that has been designated as a transit village. 10.  (New section)   A municipality and a county in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner, may be granted priority on all applications for funding from programs that are administered by the Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation that support the use of transit in the transit village zone as an alternative to automobile transportation, the improvement of mass transit accessibility, the creation of an environment around a transit stop or station that supports pedestrian and transit use, the improvement of mobility through the use of mass transit, the provision of local circulator transit services that provide access to transit hubs, and the reduction of traffic congestion. 11.  (New section)   A municipality or a county in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner, shall receive priority on all applications for funding from programs that are administered by State agencies and departments that support the use of transit through transit oriented developments characterized by dense clustering of buildings that include in the same buildings or in different buildings within close proximity to each other residential, retail or commercial space and office, industrial or other employment uses that do not pose a nuisance to nearby residents, the preservation of green and open space, and the reclamation of brown fields. 12.  (New section)    A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit, to be computed as provided by regulation promulgated by the State Treasurer in consultation with the Office of Smart Growth, against the franchise tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or against the tax otherwise due under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  The credit shall be an amount equal to four percent of allowable costs plus such other incentives deemed appropriate, for any taxpayer who is an applicant for development and who gains approval and constructs a development wholly within a designated transit village.  For the purposes of this section, allowable costs means amounts properly chargeable to a capital account, other than for the purchase or remediation of the capital asset, which are paid or incurred for construction or rehabilitation, including commissions; interest; legal, engineering, architectural, and other professional fees allocable to construction or rehabilitation; closing costs excluding open space taxes; and site costs, not to exceed $200 per square foot of finished interior space. 13.  (New section)   A municipality or county may receive funding in the form of loans or grants from any public or private source in order to support the development of a transit village.  Funding received from sources other than those that are administered by State agencies and departments shall not bar a transit village from priority funding under programs that are administered by State agencies and departments. 14.  (New section)    A municipality or county in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner may establish financing mechanisms pursuant to the "Redevelopment Area Bond Financing Law," sections 1 through 10 of P.L.2001, c.310 (C.40A:12A-64 et seq.), to be utilized only for those improvements that have been identified in the capital improvement subplan element. 15.  (New section)   A municipality in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner may use revenue allocation financing and the dedication of payments in lieu of taxes toward the retirement of debt incurred in the development of the transit village, pursuant to the "Revenue Allocation District Financing Act," sections 11 through 41 of P.L.2001, c.310 (C.52:27D-459 et seq.), to make those improvements that have been identified in the capital improvement subplan element. 16.  (New section)   A municipality in which a transit village that has been designated by the commissioner is located on a Brownfield site shall be eligible to participate in remediation programs and receive funding pursuant to the "Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act," sections 23 through 43 and section 45 of P.L.1993, c.139 (C.58:10B-1 et seq.). 17.  (New section)   Notwithstanding any rule or regulation to the contrary, home buyers purchasing homes in a transit village designated by the commissioner, that have been developed pursuant to a transit village plan element, capital improvement program, and transit village ordinance, shall be eligible for home buyer homeownership programs offered through New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. 18.  (New section)   The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection may develop an expedited and coordinated permit review and approval process for transit villages designated by the Commissioner of Transportation. The applicability of this expedited and coordinated permit review and approval process shall include, but not be limited to, permits involving environmental natural resource and site remediation issues. 19.  (New section)   A minimum safe distance, as determined by New Jersey Transit Corporation, shall be maintained between active New Jersey Transit rail lines and any development within a transit village. 20.  Section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28) is amended to read as follows: 19.  [Preparation;

In the case of a municipality situated within the Highlands Region, as defined in section 3 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-3), the master plan shall include a specific policy statement indicating the relationship of the proposed development of the municipality, as developed in the master plan, to the Highlands regional master plan adopted pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-8). (cf: P.L.2021, c.6, s.1.) 21.  Section 49 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-62) is amended to read as follows: 49.  [Power to zone.]     a.   The governing body may adopt or amend a zoning ordinance relating to the nature and extent of the uses of land and of buildings and structures thereon.  Such ordinance shall be adopted after the planning board has adopted the land use plan element and the housing plan element of a master plan, and all of the provisions of such zoning ordinance or any amendment or revision thereto shall either be substantially consistent with the land use plan element and the housing plan element of the master plan or designed to effectuate such plan elements; provided that the governing body may adopt a zoning ordinance or amendment or revision thereto which in whole or part is inconsistent with or not designed to effectuate the land use plan element and the housing plan element, but only by affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized membership of the governing body, with the reasons of the governing body for so acting set forth in a resolution and recorded in its minutes when adopting such a zoning ordinance; and provided further that, notwithstanding anything aforesaid, the governing body may adopt an interim zoning ordinance pursuant to subsection b. of section 77 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-90). The zoning ordinance shall be drawn with reasonable consideration to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and to encourage the most appropriate use of land.  The regulations in the zoning ordinance shall be uniform throughout each district for each class or kind of buildings or other structure or uses of land, including planned unit development, planned unit residential development and cluster development, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts. b.    No zoning ordinance and no amendment or revision to any zoning ordinance shall be submitted to or adopted by initiative or referendum. c.     The zoning ordinance shall provide for the regulation of any airport safety zones delineated under the "Air Safety and Zoning Act of 1983," P.L.1983, c.260 (C.6:1-80 et seq.), in conformity with standards promulgated by the Commissioner of Transportation. d.    The zoning ordinance shall provide for the regulation of land adjacent to State highways in conformity with the State highway access management code adopted by the Commissioner of Transportation under section 3 of the "State Highway Access Management Act," P.L.1989, c.32 (C.27:7-91), for the regulation of land with access to county roads and highways in conformity with any access management code adopted by the county under R.S.27:16-1 and for the regulation of land with access to municipal streets and highways in conformity with any municipal access management code adopted under R.S.40:67-1. This subsection shall not be construed as requiring a zoning ordinance to establish minimum lot sizes or minimum frontage requirements for lots adjacent to but restricted from access to a State highway. e.     The governing body may adopt or amend a zoning ordinance to set forth a transit village zone that shall either be substantially consistent with a transit village plan element of the master plan or designed to effectuate that plan element.  Upon adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance pursuant to this subsection the governing body may submit the ordinance to the Commissioner of Transportation for designation of the zone as a transit village. f.     A municipality that is seeking to establish a transit village zone shall establish zoning that is supportive of transit service and development.  A municipality that is seeking to establish a transit village development district shall designate an area around the transit facility in which it intends to develop a plan that supports pedestrian and transit use and adopt zoning regulations that will enforce the objectives of the transit village zone. (cf: P.L.2013, c.106, s.13) 22.  (New section)   The commissioner may allocate up to $10 million per year for the three years next following the enactment of this act from whatever State or federal funds are made available for the purposes of this act; however, the Legislature may authorize a greater amount. 23.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes the "New Jersey Transit Villages Act" for the purpose of encouraging municipalities to promote intensive mixed-use development within close proximity to mass transit. The bill encourages municipalities to use transit-oriented development techniques by directing transportation investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and suburban areas around transit hubs.  The bill also seeks to increase transportation options and transit availability, which will have the effect of reducing automobile traffic, stabilizing property taxes, and providing affordable housing. Several years ago the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation administratively established the "Transit Village Initiative" to encourage appropriate intensive development within a half-mile radius of mass transit facilities. This bill would codify the Transit Village Initiative and permit State funding to be used to further the goals of the program.

S2760 SENATE, No. 2760 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 15, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  NILSA I. CRUZ-PEREZ District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) SYNOPSIS New Jersey Transit Villages Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the establishment of transit villages, supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1975, c.291. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)    Sections 1 through 19 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey Transit Villages Act. 2.    (New section)    The Legislature finds and declares: a.     Historically, the relationships between land use and transportation were quite clear and efficient.  Communities were organized so that the goods that they produced could easily be shipped to others, by road, canal, river, lake, or ocean, as the particular geographical circumstances dictated.  Personal travel generally occurred by the same routes.  The relationships were based on the functional requirement of directly and efficiently moving goods and people, as well as on the limited availability of alternative modes of travel and transport. b.    As the road network began to expand throughout this State to accommodate increased automobile and truck use, the relationship between land use and transportation changed.  The proliferation of the private automobile as well as the increased number of cars per household led to the creation of new patterns and densities of development.  In the past 40 to 50 years, land use development patterns have generally taken the form of decentralized, large-lot, single use districts, connected by a maze of roadways.  Zoning and other government regulations have reinforced this trend. c.     As undeveloped land has become scarce and roadways have become more congested, people are reexamining the original land use patterns within traditional town-centered communities. In New Jersey this effort has been strongly supported by the State Development and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). The opportunity now exists to redefine and develop new patterns of development that encourage active, safe, pedestrian communities that support, and are supported by, transit. d.    The New Jersey Transit Villages Act will encourage individual municipalities to begin influencing land use patterns, densities, the general character of their communities, and eventually, the overall quality of life, while at the same time encouraging increased rider-ship on transit systems that have been the focus of major public investment. e.     Projected population increases for the State will place significant strains on the highway and road network. f.     Continuation of existing development patterns that encourage single-occupancy vehicle automobile trips, given these population increases, will lead to levels of congestion beyond the mitigation ability of the State. g.    New Jersey drivers collectively waste over 261 million hours per year sitting in traffic, negatively impacting our quality of life and losing valuable time that could be better spent with our families.  In terms of lost productivity, sitting in traffic costs each New Jersey driver nearly $1,300 per year. h.    Encouraging development and redevelopment based on smart growth principles will direct transportation investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and suburban areas, protect existing open space, conserve natural resources, increase transportation options and transit availability, reduce automobile traffic and dependency, stabilize property taxes, and provide affordable housing. i.     Efficient and compact development patterns around transit hubs will encourage transit use, thereby limiting congestion and reducing the strain on the existing road network. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the New Jersey Department of Transportation to encourage this type of development wherever possible. 3.    (New section)  As used in this act: Commissioner means the Commissioner of Transportation. Office of Smart Growth means the Office of State Planning established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-201). "Transit village" means, as designated by the commissioner, a compact, mixed-use, walkable community, centered on a mass transit hub or access point that is regularly served by a mass transit service or where there is a defined future potential that will support a transit service that, by design, increases transit ridership and reduces reliance on single-occupant vehicular transportation. "Transit village plan element" means a composite of one or more written or graphic proposals for a compact, mixed-use, walkable community, centered on a mass transit hub or access point that is regularly served by a mass transit service that is an amendment and supplement to a municipalitys master plan. "Transit village zone" means a bounded area encompassing all parcels or portions of parcels within one-half mile of a mass transit hub or access point and that is located along a mass transit route, or that is identified as having potential for transit service, as evidenced by existing or planned mixed-use development that accommodates high commercial intensities, high employment clusters, moderate to high residential density consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan as defined in the municipal zoning ordinance, and design features that promote pedestrian and bicycle circulation. 4.    (New section)    It is the intent and purpose of this act to: a.     encourage municipal action to promote intensive mixed-use development in close proximity to mass transportation services, to be known as transit villages; b.    increase transit ridership, reduce reliance on single-occupant vehicular traffic, and facilitate pedestrian, bicycle, and mass transportation trips through clustering of uses and urban design features; c.     promote residential development with a mix of housing types and a range of housing prices, including both owner-occupied housing and apartments, within transit villages; d.    improve mobility options for pedestrians, cyclists, and transit dependent people; e.     promote use of mass transportation by encouraging intermodal service and access by modes other than single-occupant vehicles; and f.    encourage the appropriate and efficient expenditure of public funds by the coordination of public development with land use policies. 5.   (New section)    a.   The municipal planning board may adopt a transit village plan element as an amendment and supplement to its master plan pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28). b.   The transit village plan element shall include a capital improvement subplan element for the plan area that provides for shared parking and reduced parking for single-occupancy vehicles within the plan area, the creation of mixed-use developments, minimum development density standards, the improvement of bicycle and pedestrian facilities, the connectivity of the street network, and measures to ensure compliance with the federal "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990" (42 U.S.C. s. 12101 et seq.).  The capital improvement subplan element may also include a mix of infrastructure financing strategies. c.   When a municipal planning board has adopted a transit village plan element, the official map of the municipality shall be amended to reflect the provisions of that plan. d.   The transit village plan element shall include a circulation subplan element for the transit village zone pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28). 6.    (New section)    a.   The Office of Smart Growth, in consultation with the commissioner and the Executive Director of the New Jersey Transit Corporation, shall review a proposed transit village plan element and determine whether it is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. b.   Following adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance to effectuate a transit village plan element the governing body shall submit the ordinance to the commissioner for designation of the transit village zone as a transit village.  The commissioner, in consultation with the Executive Director of the New Jersey Transit Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of section 5 of P.L.1966, c.301 (C.27:1A-5), shall designate a transit village zone as a transit village if the commissioner determines that the plan is consistent with the provisions of this act and the Statewide Capital Investment Strategy prepared pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27:1B-22). c.     The commissioner may adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this section. 7.    (New section)    a.   A municipality may establish a transit village zone pursuant to a transit village plan element, in accordance with section 49 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-62). b.    Where the municipality has adopted a development transfer ordinance each transit village zone shall be designated as a receiving zone under that ordinance pursuant to P.L.    , c.     (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.    (New section)    The commissioner, in consultation with the Office of Smart Growth, shall promulgate rules and regulations for administration of a transit village grant funding program.  These rules shall include but not be limited to: the criteria that a municipality shall meet in order for the Office of Smart Growth to determine that a transit village master plan element is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, adopted pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.); transit village design guidelines developed by the New Jersey Transit Corporation; and incentives and benefits associated with being designated as a transit village including, but not limited to, planning and capital funding, funding for transit planning, funding for station improvement, and prioritization for such funding. 9.    (New section)   The commissioner may enter into contracts with municipalities to maintain roads within an area that has been designated as a transit village. 10.  (New section)   A municipality and a county in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner, may be granted priority on all applications for funding from programs that are administered by the Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation that support the use of transit in the transit village zone as an alternative to automobile transportation, the improvement of mass transit accessibility, the creation of an environment around a transit stop or station that supports pedestrian and transit use, the improvement of mobility through the use of mass transit, the provision of local circulator transit services that provide access to transit hubs, and the reduction of traffic congestion. 11.  (New section)   A municipality or a county in which a transit village has been designated by the commissioner, shall receive priority on all applications for funding from programs that are administered by State agencies and departments that support the use of transit through transit oriented developments characterized by dense clustering of buildings that include in the same buildings or in different buildings within close proximity to each other residential, retail or commercial space and office, industrial or other employment uses that do not pose a nuisance to nearby residents, the preservation of green and open space, and the reclamation of brown fields. 12.  (New section)    A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit, to be computed as provided by regulation promulgated by the State Treasurer in consultation with the Office of Smart Growth, against the franchise tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) or against the tax otherwise due under the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.  The credit shall be an amount equal to four percent of allowable costs plus such other incentives deemed appropriate, for any taxpayer who is an applicant for development and who gains approval and constructs a development wholly within a designated transit village.  For the purposes of this section, allowable costs means amounts properly chargeable to a capital account, other than for the purchase or remediation of the capital asset, which are paid or incurred for construction or rehabilitation, including commissions;

The zoning ordinance shall be drawn with reasonable consideration to the character of each district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses and to encourage the most appropriate use of land.  The regulations in the zoning ordinance shall be uniform throughout each district for each class or kind of buildings or other structure or uses of land, including planned unit development, planned unit residential development and cluster development, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in other districts. b.    No zoning ordinance and no amendment or revision to any zoning ordinance shall be submitted to or adopted by initiative or referendum. c.     The zoning ordinance shall provide for the regulation of any airport safety zones delineated under the "Air Safety and Zoning Act of 1983," P.L.1983, c.260 (C.6:1-80 et seq.), in conformity with standards promulgated by the Commissioner of Transportation. d.    The zoning ordinance shall provide for the regulation of land adjacent to State highways in conformity with the State highway access management code adopted by the Commissioner of Transportation under section 3 of the "State Highway Access Management Act," P.L.1989, c.32 (C.27:7-91), for the regulation of land with access to county roads and highways in conformity with any access management code adopted by the county under R.S.27:16-1 and for the regulation of land with access to municipal streets and highways in conformity with any municipal access management code adopted under R.S.40:67-1. This subsection shall not be construed as requiring a zoning ordinance to establish minimum lot sizes or minimum frontage requirements for lots adjacent to but restricted from access to a State highway. e.     The governing body may adopt or amend a zoning ordinance to set forth a transit village zone that shall either be substantially consistent with a transit village plan element of the master plan or designed to effectuate that plan element.  Upon adoption or amendment of a zoning ordinance pursuant to this subsection the governing body may submit the ordinance to the Commissioner of Transportation for designation of the zone as a transit village. f.     A municipality that is seeking to establish a transit village zone shall establish zoning that is supportive of transit service and development.  A municipality that is seeking to establish a transit village development district shall designate an area around the transit facility in which it intends to develop a plan that supports pedestrian and transit use and adopt zoning regulations that will enforce the objectives of the transit village zone. (cf: P.L.2013, c.106, s.13) 22.  (New section)   The commissioner may allocate up to $10 million per year for the three years next following the enactment of this act from whatever State or federal funds are made available for the purposes of this act; however, the Legislature may authorize a greater amount. 23.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes the "New Jersey Transit Villages Act" for the purpose of encouraging municipalities to promote intensive mixed-use development within close proximity to mass transit. The bill encourages municipalities to use transit-oriented development techniques by directing transportation investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and suburban areas around transit hubs.  The bill also seeks to increase transportation options and transit availability, which will have the effect of reducing automobile traffic, stabilizing property taxes, and providing affordable housing. Several years ago the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation administratively established the "Transit Village Initiative" to encourage appropriate intensive development within a half-mile radius of mass transit facilities. This bill would codify the Transit Village Initiative and permit State funding to be used to further the goals of the program.
