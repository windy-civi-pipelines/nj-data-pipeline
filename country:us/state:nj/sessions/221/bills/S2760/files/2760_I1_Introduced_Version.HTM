supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.1975, c.291.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    Sections
1 through 19 of this act shall be known and may be cited as the New Jersey
Transit Villages Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)    The
Legislature finds and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Historically, the
relationships between land use and transportation were quite clear and
efficient.  Communities were organized so that the goods that they produced
could easily be shipped to others, by road, canal, river, lake, or ocean, as
the particular geographical circumstances dictated.  Personal travel generally
occurred by the same routes.  The relationships were based on the functional
requirement of directly and efficiently moving goods and people, as well as on
the limited availability of alternative modes of travel and transport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    As the road network
began to expand throughout this State to accommodate increased automobile and
truck use, the relationship between land use and transportation changed.  The
proliferation of the private automobile as well as the increased number of cars
per household led to the creation of new patterns and densities of
development.  In the past 40 to 50 years, land use development patterns have
generally taken the form of decentralized, large-lot, single use districts,
connected by a maze of roadways.  Zoning and other government regulations have
reinforced this trend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As undeveloped land has
become scarce and roadways have become more congested, people are reexamining
the original land use patterns within traditional town-centered communities. 
In New Jersey this effort has been strongly supported by the State Development
and Redevelopment Plan adopted pursuant to P.L.1985, c.398 (C.52:18A-196 et al.). 
The opportunity now exists to redefine and develop new patterns of development
that encourage active, safe, pedestrian communities that support, and are
supported by, transit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The New Jersey Transit
Villages Act will encourage individual municipalities to begin influencing
land use patterns, densities, the general character of their communities, and
eventually, the overall quality of life, while at the same time encouraging
increased rider-ship on transit systems that have been the focus of major
public investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Projected population
increases for the State will place significant strains on the highway and road
network.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Continuation of
existing development patterns that encourage single-occupancy vehicle
automobile trips, given these population increases, will lead to levels of
congestion beyond the mitigation ability of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    New Jersey drivers
collectively waste over 261 million hours per year sitting in traffic,
negatively impacting our quality of life and losing valuable time that could be
better spent with our families.  In terms of lost productivity, sitting in
traffic costs each New Jersey driver nearly $1,300 per year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    Encouraging development
and redevelopment based on smart growth principles will direct transportation
investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and suburban areas,
protect existing open space, conserve natural resources, increase
transportation options and transit availability, reduce automobile traffic and
dependency, stabilize property taxes, and provide affordable housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Efficient and compact
development patterns around transit hubs will encourage transit use, thereby
limiting congestion and reducing the strain on the existing road network. 
Therefore, it is in the best interest of the New Jersey Department of
Transportation to encourage this type of development wherever possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section)  As used
in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Transportation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Office of Smart Growth means
the Office of State Planning established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1985,
c.398 (C.52:18A-201).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Transit village&quot;
means, as designated by the commissioner, a compact, mixed-use, walkable
community, centered on a mass transit hub or access point that is regularly
served by a mass transit service or where there is a defined future potential
that will support a transit service that, by design, increases transit
ridership and reduces reliance on single-occupant vehicular transportation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Transit village plan
element&quot; means a composite of one or more written or graphic proposals for
a compact, mixed-use, walkable community, centered on a mass transit hub or
access point that is regularly served by a mass transit service that is an
amendment and supplement to a municipalitys master plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Transit village
zone&quot; means a bounded area encompassing all parcels or portions of parcels
within one-half mile of a mass transit hub or access point and that is located
along a mass transit route, or that is identified as having potential for transit
service, as evidenced by existing or planned mixed-use development that
accommodates high commercial intensities, high employment clusters, moderate to
high residential density consistent with the State Development and
Redevelopment Plan as defined in the municipal zoning ordinance, and design
features that promote pedestrian and bicycle circulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section)    It is
the intent and purpose of this act to: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     encourage municipal
action to promote intensive mixed-use development in close proximity to mass
transportation services, to be known as transit villages;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    increase transit
ridership, reduce reliance on single-occupant vehicular traffic, and facilitate
pedestrian, bicycle, and mass transportation trips through clustering of uses
and urban design features;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     21.  Section 49 of P.L.1975,
c.291 (C.40:55D-62) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     49.  <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>Power to zone.<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>     a.   The
governing body may adopt or amend a zoning ordinance relating to the nature and
extent of the uses of land and of buildings and structures thereon.  Such
ordinance shall be adopted after the planning board has adopted the land use
plan element and the housing plan element of a master plan, and all of the
provisions of such zoning ordinance or any amendment or revision thereto shall
either be substantially consistent with the land use plan element and the
housing plan element of the master plan or designed to effectuate such plan
elements; provided that the governing body may adopt a zoning ordinance or
amendment or revision thereto which in whole or part is inconsistent with or
not designed to effectuate the land use plan element and the housing plan
element, but only by affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized
membership of the governing body, with the reasons of the governing body for so
acting set forth in a resolution and recorded in its minutes when adopting such
a zoning ordinance; and provided further that, notwithstanding anything aforesaid,
the governing body may adopt an interim zoning ordinance pursuant to subsection
b. of section 77 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-90).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The zoning ordinance shall be
drawn with reasonable consideration to the character of each district and its
peculiar suitability for particular uses and to encourage the most appropriate
use of land.  The regulations in the zoning ordinance shall be uniform
throughout each district for each class or kind of buildings or other structure
or uses of land, including planned unit development, planned unit residential
development and cluster development, but the regulations in one district may
differ from those in other districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    No zoning ordinance and
no amendment or revision to any zoning ordinance shall be submitted to or
adopted by initiative or referendum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The zoning ordinance
shall provide for the regulation of any airport safety zones delineated under
the &quot;Air Safety and Zoning Act of 1983,&quot; P.L.1983, c.260 (C.6:1-80 et
seq.), in conformity with standards promulgated by the Commissioner of
Transportation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The zoning ordinance
shall provide for the regulation of land adjacent to State highways in
conformity with the State highway access management code adopted by the
Commissioner of Transportation under section 3 of the &quot;State Highway
Access Management Act,&quot; P.L.1989, c.32 (C.27:7-91), for the regulation of
land with access to county roads and highways in conformity with any access
management code adopted by the county under R.S.27:16-1 and for the regulation of
land with access to municipal streets and highways in conformity with any
municipal access management code adopted under R.S.40:67-1. This subsection
shall not be construed as requiring a zoning ordinance to establish minimum lot
sizes or minimum frontage requirements for lots adjacent to but restricted from
access to a State highway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>e.     The governing body
may adopt or amend a zoning ordinance to set forth a transit village zone that
shall either be substantially consistent with a transit village plan element of
the master plan or designed to effectuate that plan element.  Upon adoption or
amendment of a zoning ordinance pursuant to this subsection the governing body
may submit the ordinance to the Commissioner of Transportation for designation
of the zone as a transit village.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>f.     A municipality that
is seeking to establish a transit village zone shall establish zoning that is
supportive of transit service and development.  A municipality that is seeking
to establish a transit village development district shall designate an area
around the transit facility in which it intends to develop a plan that supports
pedestrian and transit use and adopt zoning regulations that will enforce the
objectives of the transit village zone.</u></p>

for the three years next following the enactment of this act from whatever
State or federal funds are made available for the purposes of this act;

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the
&quot;New Jersey Transit Villages Act&quot; for the purpose of encouraging
municipalities to promote intensive mixed-use development within close
proximity to mass transit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill encourages
municipalities to use transit-oriented development techniques by directing
transportation investments into the redevelopment of our older urban and
suburban areas around transit hubs.  The bill also seeks to increase transportation
options and transit availability, which will have the effect of reducing
automobile traffic, stabilizing property taxes, and providing affordable
housing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Several years ago the New Jersey Department of Transportation and the New Jersey Transit Corporation administratively
established the &quot;Transit Village Initiative&quot; to encourage appropriate
intensive development within a half-mile radius of mass transit facilities. 
This bill would codify the Transit Village Initiative and permit State funding
to be used to further the goals of the program.</p>
