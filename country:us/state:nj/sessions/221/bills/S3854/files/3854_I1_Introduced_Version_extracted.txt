"Qualified family caregiver" means an individual resident of this State with gross income for the taxable year not in excess of $100,000 if filing jointly, as a head of household, or as a surviving spouse, or not in excess of $50,000 if filing separately or unmarried, who provides care and support to a qualifying armed service member to whom the caregiver is a relative. "Relative" means an individual related by consanguinity within the third degree by law or blood. (cf: P.L.2017, c.67, s.2) 2. This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the Wounded Warrior Caregivers Relief Act to extend the tax credit benefit to caregivers of certain veterans. Under current law, the Wounded Warrior Caregivers Relief Act provides a gross income tax credit to family caregivers of armed service members with service-connected disabilities arising out of service on or after September 11, 2001. The bill revises the definition of veteran to mean any citizen and resident of this State discharged or released under honorable circumstances from active service in any branch of the Armed Forces of the United States and extends the tax credit to caregivers of veterans who fall under the revised definition.
