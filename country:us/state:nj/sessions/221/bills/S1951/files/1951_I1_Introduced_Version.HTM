<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  In the event that a
nursing home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, and the nursing home received a rating of two stars or
higher in the preceding quarter, the Division of Medical Assistance and Health
Services in the Department of Human Services shall issue a warning to the
nursing home:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) urging the nursing home to
improve the quality of care provided to residents; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) advising the nursing home
that a second or subsequent one-star rating may result in the division
requiring the nursing home to take specific steps to improve the quality of
care; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) advising the nursing home
that the failure to improve quality of care at the nursing home may result in
the division imposing sanctions against the nursing home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In the event a nursing
home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services in two consecutive quarters, the division shall evaluate
whether to impose sanctions against the nursing home, which sanctions may
include, but shall not be limited to:  issuing an order prohibiting the nursing
home from admitting new Medicaid enrollees; limiting the total number of
Medicaid enrollees who may be admitted to the nursing home; and reducing or
limiting payments to the nursing home under the Department of Human Services
quality incentive payment program.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     In the event a nursing
home receives a one-star rating from the federal Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services in three consecutive quarters, the division shall evaluate
whether to impose additional sanctions against the nursing home, which
sanctions shall be in addition to, and more severe than, any sanctions imposed
pursuant to subsection b. of this section.  Sanctions imposed pursuant to this
subsection may include, but shall not be limited to:  issuing an order
prohibiting the nursing home from admitting new residents; removing current
residents who are Medicaid enrollees from the nursing home; stopping all payments
to the nursing home under the Department of Human Services quality incentive
payment program; declining to approve or revoking the approval of the owner or
operator of the nursing home to participate in Medicaid; and, in consultation
with the Department of Health, prohibiting the owner or operator of the nursing
home from obtaining an interest in, or contracting with, any other nursing home
in the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  In addition to any
other actions taken pursuant to subsection b. or c. of this section, the
division shall require a nursing home that receives a one-star rating from the
federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in three or more consecutive
quarters to submit an improvement plan to the division, in a manner and method
to be determined by division, providing a description of the action steps to be
taken by the nursing home over an 18-month period to resolve the quality issues
indicated by facilitys consecutive one-star ratings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The division, in
consultation with the Department of Health, shall review a plan submitted by a
nursing home pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.  A nursing home
shall immediately commence implementing the plan upon written approval by the
division.  If the division does not approve a nursing homes improvement plan,
the division shall return the disapproved plan to the nursing home with a
written explanation of the plans deficiencies.  The nursing home shall have 30
days from receipt of a disapproved plan to submit an updated improvement plan
to the division for approval.  If the division determines a nursing homes
updated improvement plan cannot be approved, the division shall have the
discretion to return the plan to the nursing home with a written explanation of
the plans deficiencies and allow the nursing home to submit a second updated
plan, or to make a determination that the nursing home is noncompliant with the
requirements of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Within 60 days of the
completion of the nursing homes approved improvement plan, the nursing home
shall submit a report to the division documenting the execution of the plan, as
well as the outcomes of the action steps.  The division, in consultation with
the Department of Health, shall evaluate the report and determine whether the
nursing home was compliant in implementing the plan as approved by the
division.  At the divisions discretion, a nursing home determined to be
noncompliant with the implementation of its improvement plan may be provided
additional time to fulfill the actions steps outlined in the plan.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   A nursing home that
fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall be ineligible to
receive reimbursement under the Medicaid program, provided that reimbursement
for services shall continue until all Medicaid beneficiaries residing at the
nursing home have been relocated.  The nursing home shall be responsible for
informing Medicaid residents, in writing, of the nursing homes non-compliance
with the requirements of this subsection, and shall provide the division with a
patient-centered discharge plan for current Medicaid residents within 30 days
of the receipt of the divisions written determination of noncompliance with
the requirements of this subsection.  The division shall include information on
the appeals process, established pursuant to subsection i. of this section, in
the written documentation provided to a noncompliant nursing home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     When evaluating whether
to impose sanctions against a nursing home as provided under subsection b. and
subsection c. of this section, the division shall consult with the Department
of Health concerning its recommendations for action against the nursing home,
and shall review the information concerning the nursing home that is available
on the data dashboard maintained by the Department of Health pursuant to
subsection f. of section 3 of P.L.2021, c.457 (C.26:2H-46.3).  In the event the
division does not take action against a nursing home as authorized under
subsection b. or subsection c. of this section, the division shall document the
reason why action was not taken.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In addition to any
actions taken pursuant to subsections b., c., or d. of this section, the
division may, at any time, institute any actions as shall be necessary to
protect the health and well-being of residents and staff at a nursing home.</p>

division will be required to issue a warning to the nursing home:  1) urging
the nursing home to improve the quality of care provided to residents; 2)
advising the nursing home that a second or subsequent one-star rating may
result in the division requiring the nursing home to take specific steps to
improve the quality of care; and 3) advising the nursing home that the failure

admitting new Medicaid enrollees; limiting the total number of Medicaid
enrollees who may be admitted to the nursing home; and reducing or limiting
payments to the nursing home under the DHS quality incentive payment program.  </span></p>

CMS rating in two consecutive quarters.  The sanctions may include, but will
not be limited to:  issuing an order prohibiting the nursing home from
admitting new residents; removing current residents who are Medicaid enrollees
from the nursing home; stopping all payments to the nursing home under the DHS
quality incentive payment program; declining to approve or revoking the
approval of the owner or operator of the nursing home to participate in Medicaid;

division, providing a description of the action steps to be taken by the
nursing home over an 18-month period to resolve the quality issues indicated by
nursing homes consecutive one-star ratings.  The division, in consultation
with the DOH, will review the plan and either approve it or return it to the
nursing home with a description of the changes needed for the plan to be

submit a second updated plan or to make a determination that the nursing home
is noncompliant with improvement plan requirements, which will result in the

the nursing homes compliance in implementing the plan as approved by the
division.  At the divisions discretion, a nursing home determined to be
noncompliant with the implementation of the facilitys improvement plan may be

home will be responsible for:  1) informing Medicaid residents, in writing, of
the nursing homes noncompliance with the improvement plan requirements; and 2)
providing the division with a patient-centered discharge plan for current
