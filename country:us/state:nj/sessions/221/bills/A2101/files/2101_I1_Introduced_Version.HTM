Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.2000,
c.72 (C.18A:7G-4) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  By December 15, 2000
and by October 1, 2005, each district shall prepare and submit to the
commissioner a long-range facilities plan that details the district's school
facilities needs and the district's plan to address those needs for the ensuing
five years.  Following the approval of the 2005 long-range facilities plan,
each district shall amend its long-range facilities plan at least once every
five years to update enrollment projections, building capacities, <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>and<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> health and
safety conditions<u>, and environmental sustainability goals</u>.  The
long-range facilities plan shall incorporate the facilities efficiency
standards and shall be filed with the commissioner for approval in accordance
with those standards.  For those Abbott districts that have submitted
long-range facilities plans to the commissioner prior to the effective date of
P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et al.), this subsection shall not be read to
require an additional filing by October 1, 2000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notwithstanding any
other law or regulation to the contrary, an application for a school facilities
project pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-5) shall not be
approved unless the district has filed a long-range facilities plan that is
consistent with the application and the plan has been approved by the
commissioner; except that prior to October 1, 2000, the commissioner may
approve an application if the project is necessary to protect the health or
safety of occupants of the school facility, or is related to required early
childhood education programs, or is related to a school facility in which the
functional capacity is less than 90% of the facilities efficiency standards
based on current school enrollment, or the district received bids on the school
facilities project prior to the effective date of P.L.2000, c.72 (C.18A:7G-1 et
al.) and the district demonstrates that further delay will negatively affect
the cost of the project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     An amendment to a
long-range facilities plan may be submitted at any time to the commissioner for
review and determination on the approval or disapproval of the amendment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Each long-range
facilities plan shall include a cohort survival methodology or other
methodology approved by the commissioner, accompanied by a certification by a
qualified demographer retained by the district that serves as the basis for
identifying the capacity and program needs detailed in the long-range
facilities plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The long-range
facilities plan shall include an educational adequacy inventory of all existing
school facilities in the district including the adequacy of school facilities
to educate within the district the existing and projected number of pupils with
disabilities, the identification of all deficiencies in the district's current
inventory of school facilities, which includes the identification of those
deficiencies that involve emergent health and safety concerns, and the
district's proposed plan for future construction and renovation. The long-range
facilities plan submissions shall conform to the guidelines, criteria and
format prescribed by the commissioner. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Each district shall
determine the number of &quot;unhoused students&quot; for the ensuing five-year
period calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of P.L.2000, c.72
(C.18A:7G-8).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Each district shall
submit the long-range facilities plan to the planning board of the municipality
or municipalities in which the district is situate for the planning board's
review and findings and the incorporation of the plan's goals and objectives
into the municipal master plan adopted by the municipality pursuant to section
19 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-28).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The commissioner shall
develop, for the March 2002 Report on the Cost of Providing a Thorough and
Efficient Education issued by the commissioner pursuant to section 4 of
P.L.1996, c.138 (C.18A:7F-4), facilities efficiency standards for elementary,
middle, and high schools consistent with the core curriculum school delivery
assumptions in the report and sufficient for the achievement of the core
curriculum content standards, including the provision of required programs in
Abbott districts and early childhood education programs in the districts in
which these programs are required by the State.  The area allowances per FTE
student in each class of the district shall be derived from these facilities
efficiency standards.  The commissioner shall revise the facilities efficiency
standards and the area cost allowance in accordance with such schedule as the
commissioner deems necessary.  The commissioner shall publish the revised
facilities efficiency standards and the area cost allowance in the New Jersey
Register and, within a reasonable period of time after 30 days following
publication, shall file the revised facilities efficiency standards and the
area cost allowance with the Office of Administrative Law for publication in
the New Jersey Register and those standards shall become effective immediately
upon filing. During the 30-day period the commissioner shall provide an
opportunity for public comment on the proposed facilities efficiency standards
and the area cost allowance.</p>

standards developed by the commissioner shall not be construction design

commissioner to be educationally adequate to support the achievement of the
core curriculum content standards including the provision of required programs
in Abbott districts and early childhood education programs in the districts in
which these programs are required by the State.  A district may design, at its
discretion, the educational and other spaces to be included within the school
facilities project.  The design of the project may eliminate spaces in the
facilities efficiency standards, include spaces not in the facilities
efficiency standards, or size spaces differently than in the facilities
efficiency standards upon a demonstration of the adequacy of the school

in the New Jersey Register, the commissioner shall file the facilities
efficiency standards with the Office of Administrative Law and those standards
shall become effective immediately upon filing with the Office of
Administrative Law.  During the 30-day period the commissioner shall provide an

commissioner's receipt of a long-range facilities plan for review, the

by the district.  If the commissioner determines that the plan is complete, the
commissioner shall promptly notify the district in writing and shall have 60
days from the date of that notification to determine whether to approve the
plan or not.  If the commissioner determines that the plan is not complete, the
commissioner shall notify the district in writing.  The district shall provide
to the commissioner whatever information the commissioner determines is
necessary to make the plan accurate and complete.  The district shall submit
that information to the commissioner, and the commissioner shall have 60 days

commissioner may extend by 60 days the deadline for reviewing each plan pending
at that time.</p>

Guidelines in the design and construction of school facilities projects.</p>

facilities and operations, and set goals for improving sustainability.</p>

sustainability plan would be required to contain information about improvements
to facility energy efficiency, including efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
