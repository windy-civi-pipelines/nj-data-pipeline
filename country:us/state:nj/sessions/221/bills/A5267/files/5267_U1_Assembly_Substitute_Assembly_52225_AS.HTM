<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This floor substitute requires
the Board of Public Utilities (board) to establish a program to procure and
provide incentive awards for the development of transmission-scale energy
storage systems with a reasonable likelihood of successful and timely completion. 
Under the substitute, transmission-scale energy storage system means an
energy storage system, with an installed capacity of at least 5 megawatts of
alternating current (MW AC), that is interconnected with the PJM Transmission
Network and situated inside a Transmission Zone in New Jersey or is otherwise
located in New Jersey and qualified to provide energy, capacity, or ancillary
services in the wholesale markets established by PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.
(PJM).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Procurement Goals and Tranche Structure</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the substitute
requires the board to procure at least 1,000 MW AC of installed capacity by
December 31, 2026.  To accomplish this goal, the board is required to solicit
applications for the program in an initial Tranche 1 and in Tranche 2.  In
Tranche 1, which application period is to begin no later than January 15, 2026,
the board is to procure at least 500 MW AC of its 1,000 MW AC procurement goal
by April 1, 2026.  If the board is unable to procure all 1,000 MW AC of
installed capacity in Tranche 1, the board is to approve incentive awards in
Tranche 2 until it achieves the 1,000 MW AC procurement goal established by the
substitute.  However, all incentive awards in Tranche 2 are to be approved by
December 31, 2026.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within 30 days of meeting its
1,000 MW AC procurement goal, the board is to initiate a proceeding to
determine whether to extend its procurement of transmission-scale energy
storage.  The substitute requires the board to issue a report to the Governor
and the Legislature determining whether to extend the boards procurement of
transmission-scale energy storage through subsequent tranches administered
under the same program as Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 with certain modifications as
deemed necessary by the board.  As outlined in the substitute, this report is
to contain certain information.  However, prior to administering any subsequent
tranche, the board is to conduct a market analysis, as outlined in the substitute,
to determine whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the amount of an
incentive award.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Tranche 1 and Tranche 2
Procurement</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To qualify for a Tranche 1 or
Tranche 2 incentive award, a transmission-scale energy storage system is
required to:  (1) not participate in any other energy storage program, except
for the Garden State Energy Storage Program (GSESP) to the extent that the
energy storage program established by the substitute may be incorporated into
the GSESP; (2) have an anticipated commercial operations date of no later than
December 31, 2030, unless the board permits an exception; (3) have the
associated Capacity Interconnection Rights through PJM; and (4) meet any other
eligibility criteria set by the board.  In addition to these requirements,
transmission-scale energy storage systems seeking an incentive award are to
meet certain project maturity requirements.  In Tranche 1, a transmission-scale
energy storage system is required to have entered the PJM interconnection
process and, at the time of application:  (1) have a fully-executed Generation
Interconnection Agreement or Interconnection Service Agreement through PJM; (2)
have a completed Surplus Interconnection Study through PJM; or (3) have
notified PJM of intent to transfer existing Capacity Interconnection Rights
associated with a deactivating generation station.  In Tranche 2, a
transmission-scale energy storage system is required to have entered the PJM
interconnection process and, at the time of application: (1) have a
fully-executed Generation Interconnection Agreement or Interconnection Service
Agreement through PJM; (2) have a completed Surplus Interconnection Study
through PJM; (3) have been studied by PJM in a Phase I System Impact Study and
have paid a Decision Point I Readiness Deposit to PJM; or (4) have notified PJM
of intent to transfer existing Capacity Interconnection Rights associated with
a deactivating generation station.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A Tranche 1 or Tranche 2 application
is required to include certain information and a fee, as provided in the substitute. 
At its discretion, the board may instruct an applicant on curing minor defects
in a Tranche 1 or Tranche 2 application.  The board is required to evaluate
each application based on the bid prices of the requested incentive awards,
using certain criteria to guide its evaluation as outlined in the substitute. 
The substitute permits the board to place an eligible project that does not
receive an incentive award for Tranche 1 or Tranche 2 on a waiting list and to
consider the eligible project for an incentive award during a subsequent
tranche.  Under the substitute, an incentive award is to be conditioned upon a
developers compliance with the board order determining the incentive award and
with any conditions the board requires.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition, the board is
required to develop standardized service agreements between <span

eligible projects.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 Board

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The substitute outlines
certain requirements for a board order issuing an incentive award to an
eligible project, including that the board order is required to:  (1) define
the eligible project receiving an incentive award and the eligible projects
installed capacity; (2) define the incentive award, including a payment
schedule for the 15-year award period of the incentive award, which term is to
commence no earlier than the commercial operations date of an eligible project,
and during which term an eligible project is to receive an annual incentive
award on each anniversary of the first payment date; (3) determine the amount
of funding to be allocated for payment of the incentive award beginning in the
fiscal year in which the eligible project commences commercial operations; (4)
include a participation fee as the board is permitted to require from the
developer; (5) require, for an eligible project awarded an incentive, a pre-development
security not to exceed $100,000 per megawatt and not to exceed in total
$10,000,000; (6) outline the conditions under which the board may, in the event
of a developers failure to operate an eligible project by the deadline stated
in the board order or to meet deadlines included in the board order, revoke an
incentive award or retain some or all of the pre-development security; (7)
provide that receipt of an incentive award for an eligible project is to be
contingent on achievement of baseline performance requirements, including, but
not limited to, availability for dispatch in a minimum number of hours per
year, as determined by the board.  The board is permitted to use the PJM
Equivalent Forced Outage Rate or another metric deemed appropriate by the board
to measure energy storage availability.  The board order is to require that the
developer report data for this purpose at regular intervals and is to provide
for a reduction of an incentive award in proportion to the number of hours of
required availability that is unmet by the eligible project; and (8) require
that a developer provide additional information to the board during the term of
the incentive award, as the board may require.  The board may set additional
requirements at its discretion, including, but not limited to, a requirement
that the developer report major development and construction milestones to the
board, maintain financial security throughout the term of the incentive award,
or any other requirement the board determines necessary to ensure continued
progress and operational viability of an eligible project.  </p>

the Board of Public Utilities.  The fund is to be administered by the board and
credited with:  (1) monies deposited into the fund by the board; (2) monies
appropriated by the Legislature; and (3) any return on investment of monies
deposited in the fund.  Each year, the board is to deposit into the fund a

charge; and (2) monies made available from other funding sources, as determined
by the board, which sources are to include, but not be limited to, federal
