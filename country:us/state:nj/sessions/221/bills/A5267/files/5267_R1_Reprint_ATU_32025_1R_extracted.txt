(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) from any of the following sources, singly or in combination: a.   revenues from the societal benefits charge established pursuant to subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60); b.   monies allocated to the board from the Global Warming Solutions Fund, established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-50), and consistent with the objectives set forth in the Global Warming Response Act, P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-37 to -57); c.   any appropriations made by the Legislature for the program established pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); or d.   any other sources of available funding.1 7.   Section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) is amended to read as follows: 12. a. Simultaneously with the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate: (1) [The] the costs for the social programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the board chooses to modify the program; (2) [Nuclear] nuclear plant decommissioning costs; (3) [The] the costs of demand side management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment, and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for energy efficiency, light, medium, and heavy-duty plug-in electric vehicles, including school buses, and associated plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, 1energy storage,1 and Class I renewable energy programs that provide environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and provided that 25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells.  The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer period of time.  The board shall make these determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding.  1[The board shall set the societal benefits charge, in] In1 addition to the determinations above, 1[to include full funding of the costs, as determined by the board, of providing] the board shall allocate sufficient funding from the societal benefits charge to cover the remaining cost of fully funding1 incentive award payments for transmission-scale energy storage systems that are eligible projects pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) 1, after accounting for funding allocated to this purpose from other sources1; (4) [Manufactured] manufactured gas plant remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent with mechanisms in the remediation adjustment clauses for the electric public utility and gas public utility adopted by the board; and (5) [The] the cost, of consumer education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that, together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-79), shall be sufficient to fund the consumer education program established pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-85). b.   There is established in the Board of Public Utilities a nonlapsing fund to be known as the "Universal Service Fund."  The board shall determine: the level of funding and the appropriate administration of the fund; the purposes and programs to be funded with monies from the fund; which social programs shall be provided by an electric public utility as part of the provision of its regulated services which provide a public benefit; whether the funds appropriated to fund the "Lifeline Credit Program" established pursuant to P.L.1979, c.197 (C.48:2-29.15 et seq.), the "Tenants' Lifeline Assistance Program" established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.210 (C.48:2-29.30 et seq.), the funds received pursuant to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.8621 et seq., and funds collected by electric and gas public utilities, as authorized by the board, to offset uncollectible electricity and natural gas bills should be deposited in the fund; and whether new charges should be imposed to fund new or expanded social programs.

Following a determination, pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (6) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), to establish a successor program, the board shall issue rules and regulations pursuant to the requirements of subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    The board shall, in any successor program, require each electric public utility to submit proposed tariffs for board review and approval, which tariffs shall be designed to fund the successor program through base rate recovery.  Each electric public utilitys tariff submitted pursuant to this subsection shall include, apportioned according to the relative electric load of the electric public utility in this State, the total cost of: (1)   the outstanding costs of the incentives awarded to eligible projects under Tranche 1; and (2)   the costs, as the board determines necessary, for incentive awards under the successor program. c.     In addition to rules and regulations issued pursuant to subsection c. of section 6 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board shall be authorized to continue any rule, regulation, or policy used to administer Tranche 1 as the board determines necessary and appropriate to administer a successor program.  If the board determines in the report required pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) that it will extend the procurement of transmission-scale energy storage through additional tranches in accordance with subparagraph (b) of paragraph (6) of subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board shall administer future tranches in a similar manner to Tranche 1, modifying as appropriate for each subsequent tranche: (1)   the amount of megawatts to be solicited; (2)   the application requirements or eligibility criteria; (3)   the timeline for an eligible project, including, but not limited to, application deadlines or the contract term; and (4)   any other administrative modification the board deems appropriate following its report issued pursuant to section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    The board may amend a Tranche 1 incentive award, upon written consent from the developer of the eligible project, solely to change the funding mechanism of the incentive award pursuant to subsection b. of section 5 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any incentive award for an eligible project and the conditions for receiving funding pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall remain effective for the full duration of the 15-year award period specified in the boards Tranche 1 order awarding the incentive, notwithstanding any change to the funding mechanism of the incentive award.]1 13.  (New section)  a. If the board determines that an additional energy storage program is needed to achieve the 2030 energy storage target established pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2018, c.17 (C.48:3-87.8), the board shall establish a successor program by adopting rules and regulations pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). b.   The board may establish a successor program by adopting rules and regulations that implement the NJ SIP, provided that the final version of the NJ SIP is consistent with the requirements of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.   The board may fund any successor program in whole or in part by appropriating and allocating monies to the successor program from the funds collected through the societal benefits charge established pursuant to subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60).  The board may also supplement funding for the successor program by using monies from all available sources, including, but not limited to, monies from the Global Warming Solutions Fund established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-50). d.   In addition to rules and regulations issued pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board may continue any rule, regulation, or policy used to administer Tranche 1 as the board determines necessary and appropriate to administer a successor program.  If the board solicits additional eligible projects in subsequent tranches, in accordance with subsection e. of section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the board shall administer the subsequent tranches in a similar manner to Tranche 1, modifying as appropriate for each subsequent tranche: (1) the amount of megawatts to be solicited; (2) the application requirements or eligibility criteria; (3) the timeline for an eligible project, including, but not limited to, application deadlines or the contract term; and (4) any other administrative modification the board deems appropriate. e.   The board may amend a Tranche 1 or subsequent tranche incentive award, upon written consent from the developer of the eligible project, solely to change the funding source of the incentive award.  Any incentive award for an eligible project and the conditions for receiving funding pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall remain effective for the full duration of the 10- to 20-year award period specified in the boards Tranche 1 order or subsequent tranche order awarding the incentive, notwithstanding any change to the funding source of the incentive award.1 1[5. a.] 4.  (New section)1 An incentive award issued pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be funded through the societal benefits charge established pursuant to subsection a. of section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) 1, monies made available to the board from the Global Warming Solutions Fund established pursuant to section 6 of P.L.2007, c.340 (C.26:2C-50), and monies available from other funding sources, as determined by the board1.  In the fiscal year beginning on July 1, 1[2028] 20271, and in each fiscal year thereafter, 1until the end of all applicable incentive award periods,1 the board shall 1appropriate and1 allocate 1[a minimum of $60,000,000 from the funds collected through the societal benefits charge] sufficient monies from these sources1 to fully fund the incentive awards issued by the board 1,1 pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.

Simultaneously with the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate: (1) [The] the costs for the social programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the board chooses to modify the program; (2) [Nuclear] nuclear plant decommissioning costs; (3) [The] the costs of demand side management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment, and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for energy efficiency, light, medium, and heavy-duty plug-in electric vehicles, including school buses, and associated plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, 1energy storage,1 and Class I renewable energy programs that provide environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and provided that 25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells.  The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer period of time.  The board shall make these determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding.  1[The board shall set the societal benefits charge, in] In1 addition to the determinations above, 1[to include full funding of the costs, as determined by the board, of providing] the board shall allocate sufficient funding from the societal benefits charge to cover the remaining cost of fully funding1 incentive award payments for transmission-scale energy storage systems that are eligible projects pursuant to P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) 1, after accounting for funding allocated to this purpose from other sources1; (4) [Manufactured] manufactured gas plant remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent with mechanisms in the remediation adjustment clauses for the electric public utility and gas public utility adopted by the board; and (5) [The] the cost, of consumer education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that, together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-79), shall be sufficient to fund the consumer education program established pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-85). b.   There is established in the Board of Public Utilities a nonlapsing fund to be known as the "Universal Service Fund."  The board shall determine: the level of funding and the appropriate administration of the fund; the purposes and programs to be funded with monies from the fund; which social programs shall be provided by an electric public utility as part of the provision of its regulated services which provide a public benefit; whether the funds appropriated to fund the "Lifeline Credit Program" established pursuant to P.L.1979, c.197 (C.48:2-29.15 et seq.), the "Tenants' Lifeline Assistance Program" established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.210 (C.48:2-29.30 et seq.), the funds received pursuant to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.8621 et seq., and funds collected by electric and gas public utilities, as authorized by the board, to offset uncollectible electricity and natural gas bills should be deposited in the fund; and whether new charges should be imposed to fund new or expanded social programs. (cf: P.L.2022, c.86, s.2) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately.
