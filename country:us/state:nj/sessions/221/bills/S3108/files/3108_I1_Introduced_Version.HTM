<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An unintended consequence of
two bodies of law, the <u>&quot;</u>Pay to Play<u>&quot;</u> laws, P.L.2004,
c.19 and P.L.2005, c.271 (C.19:44A-20.4 et al) and the &quot;New Jersey
Prevailing Wage Act,&quot; P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et seq.) is to make
it difficult for small, local businesses to contract with municipalities and
counties.  These bodies of law impose requirements and costs on businesses
which contract with public entities for relatively modest dollar amounts.  The
threshold dollar amounts set under these laws is lower than the bid threshold
amounts authorized under the &quot;Local Public Contracts Law.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
governing bodies of counties, municipalities, and other contracting units
subject to the &quot;Local Public Contracts Law&quot; (LPCL) may authorize a
purchasing agent or other employee to award contracts below a certain dollar
amount without public advertising for bids.  The statutory bid threshold is
$17,500, however, a contracting unit that has appointed a qualified purchasing
agent (QPA), can set the bid threshold at a higher amount.  The statute
provides that a contracting unit with a QPA can set the bid threshold at up to
$25,000, which amount is adjusted by the Governor every five years to account
for inflation.  The Governors adjusted threshold amount currently allows
contracting units that have appointed a QPA to set the bid threshold at up to
$44,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The pay-to-play laws require
contracts above $17,500 to be awarded pursuant to a fair and open process.  The
&quot;New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act&quot; <span lang=EN>stipulates the payment
of prevailing wage rates for workers on construction projects that are
subsidized by public funds of over $2,000, in the case of counties, and an
amount below $17,500, in the case of municipalities.  The bill also removes
certain provisions added by P.L.2023, c.30 which would no longer be necessary
under this bill.</span></p>

the threshold amounts under the pay to play and prevailing wage laws to make
them the same as the amount applicable to the contract under the LPCL. </span></p>
