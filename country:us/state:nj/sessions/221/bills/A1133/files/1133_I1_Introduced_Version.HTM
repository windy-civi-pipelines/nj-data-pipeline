Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The deployment of small
wireless facilities and other next-generation wireless and broadband network
facilities is a matter of federal and statewide concern and interest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Wireless and broadband
products and services are a significant and continually growing part of the
States economy and encouraging the development of strong and robust wireless
and broadband communications networks throughout the State is integral to the
States economic competitiveness;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Rapid deployment of
small wireless facilities will serve important Statewide goals, such as:
meeting the growing consumer demand for wireless data; increasing competitive
options for communications services available to the States residents;
promoting the ability of the States residents to communicate with their
neighbors and with their State and local governments; and promoting public
safety;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Small wireless
facilities, including facilities commonly referred to as small cells and
distributed antenna systems, are most cost-effective for a wireless service
provider when deployed in rights-of-way;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     To meet the key
objectives of federal law and P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill), wireless providers must be granted access
to rights-of-way and have the ability to attach to infrastructure in rights-of-way

densify wireless networks and to provide next-generation wireless services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Rates and fees for the
permitting and deployment of small wireless facilities in rights-of-way and on
authority infrastructure, including utility poles, throughout the State,
consistent with federal law, is reasonable and will encourage the development
of robust next-generation wireless and broadband networks for the benefit of
residents throughout the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Authorities actively
manage rights-of-way, acting as trustees of this limited public asset, to
protect residents safety, preserve the character of communities, and maintain
availability for current and future uses; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The procedures, rates,
and fees established in P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill) should be consistent with federal law and
are fair, reasonable, and further the States interest in facilitating and
supporting a robust, reliable, and technologically-advanced wireless and
broadband network and reflect a balancing of the interests of the wireless
providers deploying new small wireless facilities and the interests of
authorities in managing and recovering the cost of managing the<u> </u>rights-of-way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill provides that each new, replaced, or
modified pole installed in the right-of-way for the purpose of collocating,
mounting, or installing a small wireless facility is to follow certain height
restrictions pursuant to the bill.  A wireless provider is not to install a new
pole unless the wireless provider has determined it cannot meet its service
objectives by collocating on existing poles or structures.  An authority may
adopt aesthetics requirements governing the deployment of small wireless
facilities and associated antenna equipment and poles in the right-of-way,
subject to certain requirements pursuant to the bill. A wireless provider is to
comply with undergrounding requirements that are consistent with the bill. </span></p>

letter-spacing:0pt'>      The bill requires a wireless provider to repair all
damage to the right-of-way caused by the activities of the wireless provider
and to return the right-of-way to its functional and aesthetic equivalence
before the damage, pursuant to the competitively neutral, reasonable
requirements, and specifications of the authority.  If the wireless provider
fails to make the repairs required by the authority within a reasonable time
after written notice, the authority may make those repairs and charge the
applicable party the reasonable documented cost of the repairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='line-height:150%;
letter-spacing:0pt'>      Under the bill, a wireless provider is not required
to replace or upgrade an existing pole, except for reasons of structural
necessity or compliance with applicable building codes.  A wireless provider
may, with the permission of the pole owner, replace or modify the existing
pole, but any replacement or modification is to be consistent with the design
aesthetics of the pole being modified or replaced.  The bill requires wireless
provider to notify an authority at least 30 days before the abandonment of a
small wireless facility located within the authoritys jurisdiction.  Following
receipt of the notice, the authority is to direct the wireless provider to
remove all or any portion of the small wireless facility and associated antenna
equipment that the authority determines would be in the best interest of the
public.  If the wireless provider fails to remove the abandoned small wireless
facility within 90 days after the notice, the authority may undertake to remove
the small wireless facility and recover the actual and reasonable expenses of
the removal from the wireless provider, its successors, or assigns.  </span></p>

certain requirements pursuant to the bill. Application fees for any permit

reasonable, and are in compliance with the provisions of the bill.  The bill
further provides that all rates and fees established pursuant to the bill are

to be applied by the authority in a non-discriminatory manner.  An authority
may not require a wireless provider to pay any rates, fees, or compensation to
the authority or other person other than what is expressly authorized by the
bill for the right to use or occupy the right-of-way for the collocation,

compliance with applicable building codes.  Further, except as it relates to
small wireless facilities subject to the permit and fee requirements established
pursuant the bill or otherwise specifically authorized by State or federal law,
an authority is not to adopt or enforce any regulations or requirements on the
placement or operation of communications facilities in the right-of-way by a
communications service provider authorized by federal, State, or local law to
operate in the right-of-way, regulate any communications services, or impose or
collect any tax, fee, rate, or charge for the provision of additional

ordinance, a wireless provider may install and operate a small wireless
facility and any associated poles and antenna equipment under the requirements
of the bill.  An authority may not require a wireless provider to enter into an
agreement to implement the provisions of the bill, but agreements are
permissible if voluntary and non-discriminatory.</span></p>

reasonable indemnification, insurance, and bonding requirements related to a

hold the authority and its elected officials, officers, and employees, agents,
and volunteers harmless against all claims, lawsuits, judgements, costs, liens,

unused wireless facilities or damage to the right-of-way or authority property
caused by the wireless provider or its agent.</span></p>
