and amending R.S.54:4-67</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.54:4-67 is amended
to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54:4-67.  a.  (1)  The
governing body of each municipality may by resolution fix the rate of discount
to be allowed for the payment of taxes or assessments previous to the date on
which they would become delinquent.  The rate so fixed shall not exceed 6% per
annum, shall be allowed only in case of payment made on or before the thirtieth
day previous to the date on which the taxes or assessments would become
delinquent, after subtracting the amount of applicable property tax credit as
defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6).  No such discount shall
apply to the purchaser of a total property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of
P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5).  The governing body may also fix the rate of
interest to be charged for the nonpayment of taxes, assessments, or other
municipal liens or charges, unless otherwise provided by law, on or before the
date when they would become delinquent, and may provide that no interest shall
be charged if payment of any installment is made within the tenth calendar day
following the date upon which the same became payable.  <u>The governing body,
by resolution, may extend this interest-free period up to a maximum of 30 days
during a period in which a public health emergency, pursuant to the Emergency
Health Powers Act, P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.)</u> has been declared
by the Governor and is in effect.  The rate so fixed shall not exceed 8% per
annum on the first $1,500.00 of the delinquency and 18% per annum on any amount
in excess of $1,500.00, to be calculated from the date the tax was payable
until the date that actual payment to the tax collector is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments,
in the case of a municipality that has experienced a flood, hurricane,
superstorm, tornado, or other natural disaster, interest shall not be charged
by the municipality to a delinquent taxpayer if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a state of emergency has
been declared as a result thereof by the Governor less than 30 days prior to
the date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to
R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the governing body of
the municipality adopts a resolution providing that interest shall not be
charged to a delinquent taxpayer if payment of the property tax installment,
plus any available property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018,
c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before the first day of the next calendar
month from the date upon which it became payable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The municipal clerk
shall notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the
Department of Community Affairs of its adoption of a resolution effectuating
the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection not later than the third
business day next following the municipal governing body's adoption of the
resolution.  If the municipality is under State supervision pursuant to the
provisions of Article 4 of the &quot;Local Government Supervision Act
(1947),&quot; P.L.1947, c.151 (C.52:27BB-54 et seq.), is subject to the
provisions of the &quot;Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery
Act,&quot; P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or is otherwise subject to a
memorandum of understanding or similar agreement with the division as a
condition of receiving supplemental State aid, the resolution shall not be
effective unless it is approved by the director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   (a)  As used in this
paragraph:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Eligible resident&quot;
means either:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    an employee of a
federal government agency who is furloughed because of a shutdown and receives
unemployment benefits during the shutdown or who works during a shutdown but is
not paid because of the shutdown; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   a contractor whose pay
is received through a contract with a federal government agency but whose
payment is delayed or diminished because of a shutdown, provided that the
contractor receives unemployment benefits during the shutdown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Shutdown&quot; means any
period in which there is more than a 24-hour lapse in appropriations for any
federal government agency as a result of a failure to enact a regular
appropriations bill or continuing resolution due to an impasse between the
President and the Congress of the United States or between the two Houses of
Congress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments, a
municipality shall not charge interest to a delinquent taxpayer who is an
eligible resident or who resides with a spouse, partner in a civil union, or
domestic partner who is an eligible resident, if:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    a shutdown remains in
effect for more than 21 days and either ends less than 14 days prior to the
date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to
R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, or
remains in effect on the date that the property tax installment payment is due
and payable; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (ii)   the governing body of
the municipality in which the delinquent taxpayer resides adopts a resolution
providing that interest shall not be charged to such a delinquent taxpayer if
payment of the property tax installment, less any available property tax credit
as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before
the date upon which the next property tax installment payment is payable.</p>

tax credit, as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), has been
