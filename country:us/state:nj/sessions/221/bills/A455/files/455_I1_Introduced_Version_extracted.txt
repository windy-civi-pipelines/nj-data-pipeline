(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments, in the case of a municipality that has experienced a flood, hurricane, superstorm, tornado, or other natural disaster, interest shall not be charged by the municipality to a delinquent taxpayer if: (a)   a state of emergency has been declared as a result thereof by the Governor less than 30 days prior to the date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, and (b)   the governing body of the municipality adopts a resolution providing that interest shall not be charged to a delinquent taxpayer if payment of the property tax installment, plus any available property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before the first day of the next calendar month from the date upon which it became payable.

(b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection regarding delinquent payments, a municipality shall not charge interest to a delinquent taxpayer who is an eligible resident or who resides with a spouse, partner in a civil union, or domestic partner who is an eligible resident, if: (i)    a shutdown remains in effect for more than 21 days and either ends less than 14 days prior to the date upon which a property tax installment payment is payable pursuant to R.S.54:4-66 or section 2 of P.L.1994, c.72 (C.54:4-66.1), as appropriate, or remains in effect on the date that the property tax installment payment is due and payable; and (ii)   the governing body of the municipality in which the delinquent taxpayer resides adopts a resolution providing that interest shall not be charged to such a delinquent taxpayer if payment of the property tax installment, less any available property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), is made on or before the date upon which the next property tax installment payment is payable.

(1)  In any year when the governing body changes the rate of interest to be charged for delinquent taxes, assessments or other municipal charges, or to be charged for the end of the year penalty, the governing body, after adoption of a resolution changing the rate of interest, shall provide a notice to all taxpayers, prior to the date taxes are next due or with the tax bill, stating the new rate or rates to be charged and the date that the new rate or rates take effect.  The notice may be separate from the tax bill.  No change in the rate of interest or the end of year penalty shall take effect until the required notice has been provided in accordance with this subsection. (2)  When the governing body extends the interest-free period up to a maximum of 30 days during a period in which a public health emergency, pursuant to the Emergency Health Powers Act, P.L.2005, c.222 (C.26:13-1 et seq.), has been declared by the Governor and is in effect, pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, the governing body shall provide a notice to all taxpayers.  To satisfy the notice requirement in this paragraph, the governing body may use regular mail, or may use a telephonic system and one of the following alternatives: electronic mail, text messaging system, or any other digital platform used by the municipality to disseminate information to municipal residents electronically.  The municipal clerk shall notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs of its adoption of a resolution effectuating the provisions of an extended interest free period, pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, not later than the third business day next following the municipal governing body's adoption of the resolution. c.     In municipalities that have sold their property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5), the rate of interest to be charged for the nonpayment of taxes, assessments or other municipal liens or charges shall be the same interest or delinquency rate or rates otherwise charged by the municipality, to be calculated from the date the tax was payable until the date of actual payment to the tax collector.  The purchaser of the total property tax levy shall be paid only those amounts attributable to properties included in the total property tax levy purchase and actually collected by the tax collector and which amounts shall not include any delinquent interest collected by the municipal tax collector prior to the time that the total property tax levy purchaser makes the levy payment to the municipality. d.    Whenever the time period for a property tax installment payment has been extended pursuant to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs may, by temporary order, extend the dates for payment of taxes by a municipality due to a county pursuant to R.S.54:4-74, any school district pursuant to R.S.54:4-75, and any other taxing district as provided by law. "Delinquency" means the sum of all taxes and municipal charges due on a specific real property, less the amount of applicable property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), covering any number of quarters or years.  The property shall remain delinquent, as defined herein, until such time as all unpaid taxes, including subsequent taxes and liens, together with interest thereon shall have been fully paid and satisfied and all applicable property tax credit, as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), has been credited.  The delinquency shall remain notwithstanding the issuance of a certificate of sale pursuant to R.S.54:5-32 and R.S.54:5-46, the payment of delinquent tax by the purchaser of the total property tax levy pursuant to section 16 of P.L.1997, c.99 (C.54:5-113.5) and for the purposes of satisfying the requirements for filing any tax appeal with the county board of taxation or the State tax court.  The governing body may also fix a penalty to be charged to a taxpayer with a delinquency in excess of $10,000 who fails to pay that delinquency as billed, less the amount of applicable property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6), prior to the end of the fiscal year.  If any fiscal year delinquency in excess of $10,000 is paid by the holder of an outstanding tax sale certificate or a total property tax levy purchaser, the holder or purchaser, as appropriate, shall be entitled to receive the amount of the penalty as part of the amount required to redeem such certificate of sale providing the payment is made by the tax lien holder or tax levy purchaser prior to the end of the fiscal year.  If the holder of the outstanding tax sale certificate or the levy purchaser, as appropriate, does not make the payment in full prior to the end of the fiscal year, then the holder or purchaser shall be entitled to a pro rata share of the delinquency penalty upon redemption, and the balance of the penalty shall inure to the benefit of the municipality.  The penalty so fixed shall not exceed 6% of the amount of the delinquency with respect to each most recent fiscal year only. (cf: P.L.2019, c.491, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill permits a municipality to extend the 10-day grace period in which property taxes may be paid without accruing interest during a period in which a public health emergency has been declared by the Governor and is in effect, and would clarify the form and content of the notice required to be provided to property taxpayers when a municipality extends the 10-day grace period. The bill would require municipalities to provide notice to all taxpayers when the governing body extends the 10-day grace period during a public health emergency.  The bill would permit the governing body of a municipality to satisfy the notice requirement by using either regular mail, or by using a telephonic system and one of the following alternatives:  electronic mail, a text messaging system, or any other digital platform used by the municipality to disseminate information to municipal residents electronically.  The municipality would also be required to notify the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs of its adoption of a resolution providing for an extension of the 10-day grace period not later than the third business day next following the municipal governing bodys adoption of the resolution.
