Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 1 of P.L.2013, c.203 (C.55:13C-2.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  No person shall be refused admittance to an emergency shelter for the homeless based on a perception or belief that the person: (1) has a mental illness; (2) is a drug or alcohol dependent person, as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-2; (3) is not in compliance with a prescription medication regimen; or (4) has consumed alcoholic beverages off the premises, unless there is a reasonable basis to believe that the person poses a danger to self, others, or property, or if the basis for the refusal is otherwise authorized by law or regulation. b.    Nothing in subsection a. of this section shall prohibit an emergency shelter for the homeless from prohibiting the possession or consumption of controlled dangerous substances, as defined in N.J.S.2C:35-2, or alcoholic beverages on the premises. (cf: P.L.2013, c.203, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits emergency shelters for the homeless from restricting access to the shelter based on a perception or belief that a person is: (1) a drug or alcohol dependent person; (2) not in compliance with a prescription medication regimen; or (3) has consumed alcoholic beverages off the premises of the shelter. Current law prohibits emergency homeless shelters from refusing admittance to a person who is perceived or believed to have a mental illness. This bill expands the prohibition to include other members of vulnerable populations in need of shelter. Current law also provides that a shelter may prohibit admittance if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the person poses a danger to self, others, or property, or if the basis for the refusal is otherwise authorized by law or regulation. Under the bill, shelters would continue to have the authority to refuse admittance in these circumstances. Finally, the bill provides that shelters are authorized to prohibit the possession or consumption of controlled dangerous substances and alcoholic beverages on the premises.
