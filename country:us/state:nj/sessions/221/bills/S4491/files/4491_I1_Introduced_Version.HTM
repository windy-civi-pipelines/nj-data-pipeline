<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     37.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of any other law to the contrary, a county, municipality or any contracting
unit as defined in section 2 of P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-2) which enters into
a contract providing group health care benefits to its employees pursuant to
N.J.S.40A:10-16 et seq., may allow any employee who is eligible for other
health care coverage, to waive coverage under the county's, municipality's or
contracting unit's plan to which the employee is entitled by virtue of
employment with the county, municipality or contracting unit.  The waiver shall
be in such form as the county, municipality or contracting unit shall prescribe
and shall be filed with the county, municipality or contracting unit.  In
consideration of filing such a waiver, a county, municipality or contracting
unit may pay to the employee annually an amount, to be established in the sole
discretion of the county, municipality or contracting unit, which shall not
exceed 50% of the amount saved by the county, municipality or contracting unit 
because of the employee's waiver of coverage, and, for a waiver filed on or
after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.2, which shall not exceed 25%, or
$5,000, whichever is less, of the amount saved by the county, municipality or
contracting unit because of the employee's waiver of coverage.  An employee who
waives coverage shall be permitted to resume coverage under the same terms and
conditions as apply to initial coverage if the employee ceases to be covered
through the employee's spouse for any reason, including, but not limited to,
the retirement or death of the spouse or divorce.  An employee who resumes
coverage shall repay, on a pro rata basis, any amount received which represents
an advance payment for a period of time during which coverage is resumed.  An
employee who wishes to resume coverage shall file a declaration with the
county, municipality or contracting unit, in such form as the county,
municipality or contracting unit shall prescribe, that the waiver is revoked. 
The decision of a county, municipality or contracting unit to allow its
employees to waive coverage and the amount of consideration to be paid therefor
shall not be subject to the collective bargaining process.</p>
