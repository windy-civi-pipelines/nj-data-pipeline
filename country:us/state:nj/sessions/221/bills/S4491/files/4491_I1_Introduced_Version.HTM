The commission shall establish the rules and regulations governing the enrollment and effective dates of coverage of dependents of employees it deems necessary or desirable. The rules and regulations shall not defer coverage with respect to any qualified dependent an employee has on the date the employee's employer becomes a participating employer, provided the employee was, immediately prior to the date, insured with respect to the dependent under a group insurance plan of the employer which was in effect immediately prior to the date. Under the rules and regulations established by the commission, each employee shall be given the opportunity to enroll for coverage for dependents as of the earliest date the employee becomes eligible for enrollment. With respect to the traditional plan, an employee may elect to enroll dependents for both basic coverage and major medical expense coverage but may not enroll for either coverage alone. In the event that the group health plan which covered an employee or dependents immediately prior to the date the employee's employer becomes a participating employer provides, after termination of coverage thereunder, any continuation of benefits, or would so provide in the absence of coverage pursuant to this act, no coverage shall be afforded pursuant to this act for any such expenses (i) which are covered, or which would be covered in the absence of coverage pursuant to this act, in whole or in part, by the prior insurance plan or (ii) which may be used in satisfaction of any deductible requirement under the prior insurance plan to establish entitlement to the continuation of benefits. Each employee shall furnish the Division of Pensions and Benefits, in the prescribed form, the information necessary on account of the employee's own coverage and necessary to enroll dependents. Any employee not desiring coverage at the time the employee first becomes eligible, shall give the division written notice of that fact in the form prescribed by the division. The employee may not enroll thereafter except at the times and under the conditions prescribed by the commission. Any person employed as a substitute teacher by a school district and who provides evidence of coverage under another health benefits program may waive coverage for the current school year on or after the date on which the person becomes an employee eligible for coverage. Multiple coverage in the program as an employee, dependent, or retiree shall be prohibited and the prohibition shall be implemented in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the commission.  The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable to the State Health Benefits Program and to the School Employees' Health Benefits Program to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 31 through 41 of P.L.2007, c.103 (C.52:14-17.46.1 et seq.). Commencing on the effective date of P.L.     , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or upon the expiration of a collective negotiations agreement with a relevant provision in effect as of that effective date, if an employee of a participating employer and the employees spouse are both public employees and eligible for health care benefits coverage provided by each public employer, the employee with the highest annual compensation shall select coverage with the employer, provided that the employer provides coverage for dependents, and the employees spouse shall not be eligible for health care benefits coverage provided by the public employer of the spouse.  This subsection shall be applicable to the State Health Benefits Program and to the School Employees' Health Benefits Program. (cf: P.L.2010, c.2, s.12) 4.    (New section)  a.  Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, commencing on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) or upon the expiration of a collective negotiations agreement with a relevant provision in effect as of that effective date, if an employee of an independent State authority and the employees spouse are both public employees and eligible for health care benefits coverage provided by each public employer, the employee with the highest annual compensation shall select coverage with the employer, provided that the employer provides coverage for dependents, and the employees spouse shall not be eligible for health care benefits coverage provided by the public employer of the spouse.  This section shall apply when the health care benefits coverage is provided through a health care benefits plan or program, insurance fund or joint insurance fund, or in any other manner.  This subsection shall apply to a State authority that is not covered by the provisions of section 7 of P.L.1961, c.49 (C.52:14-17.31). b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, an independent State authority which does not participate in the State Health Benefits Program shall not make payments in any form or manner to an employee who waives coverage under the health care benefits plan to which the employee is entitled by virtue of employment with the employer.  The decision of an employer to allow its employees to waive coverage shall not be subject to the collective bargaining process.  This subsection shall apply to a State authority that is not covered by the provisions of section 36 of P.L.1995, c.259 (C.52:14-17.31a). c.     As used in this section, "independent State authority" means a public authority, board, commission, corporation, or other agency or instrumentality of the State allocated, in but not of, a principal department of State government pursuant to Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1 of the New Jersey Constitution, or which is not subject to supervision or control by the department in which it is allocated, and a

Benefits Program, may allow any employee who is eligible for other health care coverage that is not under the State Health Benefits Program to waive the coverage under the State Health Benefits Program to which the employee is entitled by virtue of employment with the employer.  The waiver shall be in such form as the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits shall prescribe and
