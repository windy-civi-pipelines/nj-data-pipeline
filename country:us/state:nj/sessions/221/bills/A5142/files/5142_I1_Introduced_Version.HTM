<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires school bus
drivers, school bus aides, and any other individual who works, and is otherwise
responsible for the safety of students, on a school bus transporting one or
more students with disabilities to call the 911 emergency telephone service for
assistance in the event of a potential life-threatening emergency on the school
bus.  A school bus personnel member is required to report that call to the Office
of Special Education in the Department of Education.  Under the bill, a board
of education, or a school bus contractor providing pupil transportation
services under contract with a board of education, that employs a school bus
personnel member, as well as the office, is to maintain a record of the calls. 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A board of education, or a
school bus contractor as applicable, is required to ensure that certain training
related to school bus safety and interacting with students with disabilities
are provided to each school bus personnel member who works on a school bus
transporting students with disabilities.  Pursuant to current law, these
training programs are required to be administered to school bus drivers and
school bus aides.  The bill expands these programs to cover all other school
bus personnel members who work, and are responsible for the safety of students,
on a school bus transporting one or more students with disabilities.  A board
of education or school bus contractor that does not properly administer these
training programs is to be subject to applicable penalties established under
current law.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pursuant to the bill, the
parent or guardian of a student with disabilities, who believes that a school
bus personnel member did not properly call the 911 emergency telephone service
in the event of a potential life-threatening emergency, may file a complaint
with the Office of Special Education within the Department of Education.  A
school bus personnel member who is found by the office to have violated the
provisions concerning 911 emergency notification and follow-up reporting
requirements is to be liable for certain civil penalties.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires a school
bus that transports one or more students with disabilities to be equipped with:
1) a video camera on the interior of the school bus to monitor student safety
while the students are being transported; 2) a global positioning system that
provides information about the location and speed of each school bus in real
time; and 3) two-way communications equipment, which may include, but not be
limited to, a cellular or other wireless telephone.  Under the bill, any video
footage collected from a video camera and any data collected from a global
positioning system is to be retained for not less than 180 days from the date
it was recorded.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill requires
that each in-terminal school bus inspection conducted by the New Jersey Motor
Vehicle Commission is to provide for the inspection of the equipment required
to be installed on school buses pursuant to the bill.   </p>
