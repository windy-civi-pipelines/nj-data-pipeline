STATEMENT This bill imposes a $400 assessment on persons convicted of certain crimes committed against minors. The money collected is to be forwarded to the State Treasurer to be placed in a fund called the "Amber Alert Fund" which the bill establishes.  The Attorney General is required to distribute the money from the fund to the Missing Persons Clearinghouse in the Division of the State Police's Missing Persons Unit for the purpose of making enhancements to the Amber Alert system. After enhancements to the system have been made, any additional money from the fund shall be used for programs designed to recover abducted children. The crimes for which the $400 would be assessed are: interference with custody; luring a child into a motor vehicle, structure, or isolated area; exposing one's intimate parts to a child; and endangering the welfare of a child.  The following crimes would also be subject to the $400 fee in situations where the victim is under the age of 18 years: murder, assault, terroristic threats, kidnapping, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, and aggravated criminal sexual contact.
