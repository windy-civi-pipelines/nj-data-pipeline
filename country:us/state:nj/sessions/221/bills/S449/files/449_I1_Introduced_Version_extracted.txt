(cf: P.L.2018, c.67, s.4) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-67 et al.), commonly referred to as S-2, stipulates that State school aid to certain school districts will be reduced in accordance with a schedule detailed in the law.  Under section 4 of P.L.2018, c.67 (C.18A:7F-68), two groups of school districts are not subject to State aid reductions: 1) SDA (former Abbott) districts that spend below adequacy and are located in a municipality in which the equalized total tax rate exceeds the Statewide average; and 2) non-SDA districts that spend below adequacy by at least 10 percent and are located in a municipality in which the equalized total tax rate exceeds the Statewide average by more than 10 percent.
