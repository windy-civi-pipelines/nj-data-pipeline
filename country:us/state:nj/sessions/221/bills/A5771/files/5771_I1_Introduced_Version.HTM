(cf: P.L.2007, c.133, s.2) 4.    Section 3 of P.L.2007, c.133 (C.2C:44-8) is amended to read as follows: 3.    When a defendant is found guilty of a sex offense, the court [may] shall, at the time of sentencing and in addition to any other disposition authorized by law, order the continuation of a prior order or condition of bail that restricts the defendant's contact with the victim, or enter an order imposing such restrictions at the time of sentencing if the victim consents to the continuation or entering of the order.  In addition to restricting a defendant's contact with the victim, the court may enter an order: a.     restraining the defendant from entering the residence, property, school, or place of employment of the victim or of other family or household members of the victim and requiring the defendant to stay away from any specified place that is named in the order and is frequented regularly by the victim or other family or household members; b.    restraining the defendant from making contact with the plaintiff or others, including an order forbidding the defendant from personally or through an agent initiating any communication likely to cause annoyance or alarm including, but not limited to, personal, written, or telephone contact with the victim or other family members, or their employers, employees, or fellow workers, or others with whom communication would be likely to cause annoyance or alarm to the victim; c.     prohibiting the defendant from stalking or following, or threatening to harm, to stalk or to follow, the complainant or any other person named in the order in a manner that, taken in the context of past actions of the defendant, would put the complainant in reasonable fear that the defendant would cause the death or injury of the complainant or any other person. Behavior prohibited under this act includes, but is not limited to, behavior prohibited under the provisions of P.L.1992, c.209 (C.2C:12-10); or d.    providing for any other appropriate restraints necessary to protect the victim. An order that is entered pursuant to this section shall remain in effect until modified or terminated by further order of the court.  The court shall not modify or terminate an order without the consent of the victim. This provision shall apply to any order that is in effect on the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and any order that is entered on or after the effective date of P.L.   , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2007, c.133, s.3) 5.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires victim notification concerning the termination of a sex offenders obligation to register and requires the court to enter or continue a restraining order for a victim of a sex offense under certain circumstances. The sponsor believes that victims of sex offenses should have the right to be informed of a potential change in the status of the offender when that offender requests to be removed from the registry of sex offenders.  Those victims should also be guaranteed the opportunity to appear at any hearing on the matter and to address the court at that time.  Should the court grant the offender's request to be removed, the victim should be informed of that as well.  Additional protections through restraining orders should also be provided. Under current law, with certain exceptions, a person required to register under Megans Law may make an application to the Superior Court to terminate the obligation to register upon proof that the person has not committed an offense within 15 years following conviction or release from imprisonment, whichever is later, and is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others. Under the provisions of this bill, upon receipt of an application to terminate the obligation to register as a sex offender, the court is required to notify the victim of the sex offense for which the person is required to register of the filing of the application and the date, time, and location of any hearing on the application.  The bill provides that the victim has the right to appear at the hearing and make a statement to the court regarding the victims position on the application.  The court also is required to notify the victim if the application is granted and the persons obligation to register is terminated. In addition, current law provides that when a defendant charged with a sex offense is released from custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may, as a condition of release, issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim. Under the provisions of this bill, the court is required to issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim if the victim consents to the order being entered. Current law also provides that when a defendant is found guilty of a sex offense, the court may, at the time of sentencing, order the continuation of a prior order or condition of bail that restricts the defendants contact with the victim, or enter an order imposing these restrictions at the time of sentencing. Under the provisions of this bill, the court is required, at the time of sentencing, to order the continuation of a prior order restricting the defendants contact with the victim or enter an order imposing these restrictions if the victim consents to the continuation or entering of the order.  Further, the bill provides that an order entered under this provision is to remain in effect until modified or terminated by further order of the court.  The court is not to modify or terminate an order without the consent of the victim.  The bill provides that this provision is to apply to any orders in effect on the bills effective date and any orders entered on or after the bills effective date.

STATEMENT This bill requires victim notification concerning the termination of a sex offenders obligation to register and requires the court to enter or continue a restraining order for a victim of a sex offense under certain circumstances. The sponsor believes that victims of sex offenses should have the right to be informed of a potential change in the status of the offender when that offender requests to be removed from the registry of sex offenders.  Those victims should also be guaranteed the opportunity to appear at any hearing on the matter and to address the court at that time.  Should the court grant the offender's request to be removed, the victim should be informed of that as well.  Additional protections through restraining orders should also be provided. Under current law, with certain exceptions, a person required to register under Megans Law may make an application to the Superior Court to terminate the obligation to register upon proof that the person has not committed an offense within 15 years following conviction or release from imprisonment, whichever is later, and is not likely to pose a threat to the safety of others. Under the provisions of this bill, upon receipt of an application to terminate the obligation to register as a sex offender, the court is required to notify the victim of the sex offense for which the person is required to register of the filing of the application and the date, time, and location of any hearing on the application.  The bill provides that the victim has the right to appear at the hearing and make a statement to the court regarding the victims position on the application.  The court also is required to notify the victim if the application is granted and the persons obligation to register is terminated. In addition, current law provides that when a defendant charged with a sex offense is released from custody before trial on bail or personal recognizance, the court authorizing the release may, as a condition of release, issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim. Under the provisions of this bill, the court is required to issue an order prohibiting the defendant from having any contact with the victim if the victim consents to the order being entered. Current law also provides that when a defendant is found guilty of a sex offense, the court may, at the time of sentencing, order the continuation of a prior order or condition of bail that restricts the defendants contact with the victim, or enter an order imposing these restrictions at the time of sentencing. Under the provisions of this bill, the court is required, at the time of sentencing, to order the continuation of a prior order restricting the defendants contact with the victim or enter an order imposing these restrictions if the victim consents to the continuation or entering of the order.  Further, the bill provides that an order entered under this provision is to remain in effect until modified or terminated by further order of the court.  The court is not to modify or terminate an order without the consent of the victim.  The bill provides that this provision is to apply to any orders in effect on the bills effective date and any orders entered on or after the bills effective date.
