(2)   The program shall include information intended to increase the person's awareness of: (a)   the causes of prostitution and its relationship to human trafficking; (b)   the health risks connected with prostitution, including the risk of transmittable diseases; (c)   the consequences of convictions for prostitution or human trafficking, including penalties for subsequent convictions; and (d)   the pervasiveness of human trafficking and the effects of human trafficking on its victims. (3)   Pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2013, c.51 (C.52:17B-238), the Attorney General, in consultation with the Commission on Human Trafficking, may provide for the expenditures of monies from the "Human Trafficking Survivor's Assistance Fund" to assist with the development, maintenance, revision, and distribution of instructional program materials for the "Prostitution Offender Program," and the operation of this instructional program. (cf: P.L.2013, c.51, s.11) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides for enhanced penalties for the crime of engaging in prostitution as a patron.  In New Jersey, the offense of prostitution encompasses different conduct by various actors; penalties for the offense vary, depending on the unlawful conduct.  This bill addresses conduct by persons who purchase sexual activity, commonly referred to as johns.  Under paragraph (1) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:34-1, a person commits this offense if the actor engages in prostitution as a patron, or one who purchases sexual activity with another person in exchange for something of economic value, or the offer or acceptance of an offer to engage in sexual activity in exchange for something of economic value.  Currently, a violation of this provision is a disorderly persons offense for a first offense, punishable by up to six months imprisonment, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.  For a second or third violation, it is a crime of the fourth degree, punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both. For a fourth violation, it is a crime of the third degree, punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  In addition to any other disposition for the offense, N.J.S.A.2C:34-1.2 assesses additional penalties upon persons convicted of engaging in prostitution as a patron which include an assessment of $500, and can include participation in a prostitution offender program. This bill increases prostitution by a patron to a crime of the fourth degree, except that a fourth violation remains a crime of the third degree.  In addition, the bill provides that any fine collected shall be forwarded to the Department of the Treasury to be deposited in the "Human Trafficking Survivor's Assistance Fund" (the HTSAF) established by N.J.S.A.52:17B-238. It is the sponsors view that in combatting prostitution, closely related to the crime of human trafficking, greater emphasis should be placed on eliminating the demand for persons who may be victims of sex trafficking by targeting persons who purchase sexual activity.  All monies deposited in the HTSAF fund are required by the law to be used for the provision of services to victims of human trafficking, to promote awareness of human trafficking, and the development, maintenance, revision, and distribution of training courses and other educational materials, and the operation of educational or training programs.
