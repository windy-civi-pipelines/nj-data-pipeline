stating the applicant's name, date of birth, social security number, whether or
not the applicant has ever been convicted of a crime, and whether any criminal
charges are pending against him and, if such convictions or pending charges
exist, shall provide such details in connection therewith sufficient to readily
identify the matter referred to<u>, and specifically if the conviction or
charge was for a sex offense as defined pursuant to subsection b. of section 2
