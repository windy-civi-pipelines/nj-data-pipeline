(cf: P.L.2005, c.304, s.39) 9.    This act shall take effect on the 120th day after the date of enactment. STATEMENT The bill requires, in accordance with the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey: 1) a ward or proposed ward to be represented by counsel throughout the course of guardianship proceedings; 2) counsel to personally interview the ward or proposed ward; 3) If the ward or proposed ward is, at any time, not represented by counsel and is unable to afford counsel, the court to appoint counsel for the person; and 4) prior to the hearing date, counsel to file a report with the court in such a form and include all such provisions as required by the Administrative Director of the Courts. The bill further requires a court, in establishing a guardianship arrangement, to authorize only that level of intervention that the court finds to be least restrictive of the proposed wards rights while being consistent with the protection of the wards welfare and safety.  The bill clarifies that the court may, at any time, expand or limit the powers of the guardian or revoke or revise any previously ordered expansion or limitation of powers.  Under the bill, any proposed guardian is to comply with any applicable background screening policy for proposed guardians of incapacitated adults that is required by the Administrative Director of the Courts, including, but not limited to, fingerprinting. The bill also specifies that all actions undertaken by a guardian, whether by a guardian of the person or by a guardian of the estate, are to be undertaken with due regard to, and are to be consistent with, the wards best interests and the wards expressed wishes and preferences, to the extent that the ward is capable of expressing those wishes and preferences. Current law also requires a guardian to submit reports to the court, at time intervals ordered by the court, but it only imposes specific content requirements in association with reports that are submitted by guardians of the person; not guardians of the estate.  The existing law also authorizes the court to waive the reporting requirement entirely, and it does not require the court to actually review any of the submitted reports.  The bill would amend the law to:  1) eliminate the courts discretion to waive the reporting requirement but allow for judicial discretion in ordering a report; 2) require a report submitted by a guardian of the estate to be made in such a form as is required by the Administrative Director of the Courts and in accordance with the Court Rules, which is to state or contain information on the assets, income, disbursements, and liabilities of the guardianship estate; and 3) require the court to review the reports submitted pursuant to the bill, on at least an annual basis, in order to ensure that each guardian is properly fulfilling the guardians duties with respect to the ward or the wards estate, or both, as the case may be, and is operating in a manner consistent with the wards best interests.  The bill would also authorize the court, at any time, and would require the court whenever its annual review of the submitted reports reveals that the guardian may not be properly fulfilling the guardians duties or acting in the wards best interests, to appoint a third-party to interview the ward and the guardian, or undertake any other investigation the court may direct. The existing law requires a guardian of the estate to consider the recommendations of the wards parent or the guardian of the wards person when expending and distributing funds from the wards estate; however, an incapacitated person often does not have a living parent, and the guardian of the person may be the same as the guardian of the estate, meaning that, under existing law, there will often be no available third-party to provide recommendations to the guardian of the estate.  The bill would, therefore, amend the law to require the guardian of the estate to consider the recommendations of all of the following individuals:  1) the ward, to the extent that the ward is capable of making the recommendations; 2) if the ward is a minor, the wards parent; 3) if the ward is an incapacitated person, the spouse and any adult children of the ward or, if there are no adult children, the person or persons who are closest in degree of kinship to the ward; 4) the guardian of the wards person; and 5) the person or persons with whom the ward resides or, if the ward resides in an institution, the chief administrator of that institution.  This change will make the law consistent with the law pertaining to conservatorship, which requires a conservator to consider the recommendations of all these persons.  The bill also explicitly requires that the expenditure or distribution of funds from a wards estate to household members outside of the guardian are only to occur pursuant to order of the court. The bill also amends the existing guardianship law to modernize and clarify the existing language and paragraph and sentence structure and ensure that language is used consistently and in an active and direct voice throughout the law.

At the request of the limited guardian, and if the incapacitated person is not represented, after appointment of an attorney for the incapacitated person and with notice to all interested parties, the court may determine that a person is in need of guardian services regarding additional subject areas and may enlarge the powers of the guardian to protect the person from significant harm. h.    Limitations of guardian powers.

(cf: P.L.2005, c.304, s.32) 8.    N.J.S.3B:12-57 is amended to read as follows: 3B:12-57.  Powers and duties of a guardian of the person of a ward. a.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2005, c.304.) b.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2005, c.304.) c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2005, c.304.) d.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2005, c.304.) e.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2005, c.304.) f.     In accordance with Section 12 of P.L.2005, c.304 (C.3B:12-24.1), a guardian of the person of a ward shall exercise authority over matters relating to the rights and best interest of the ward's personal needs, only to the extent adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction.  In taking or forbearing from any action affecting the personal needs of a ward, a guardian shall give due regard to the preferences of the ward, if known to the guardian or otherwise ascertainable upon reasonable inquiry.  To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction, the guardian shall: (1)   take custody of the ward and establish the ward's place of abode in or outside of this State; (2)   personally visit the ward or if a public agency which is authorized to act pursuant to P.L.1965, c.59 (C.30:4-165.1 et seq.) and P.L.1970, c.289 (C.30:4-165.7 et seq.) or the Office of the Public Guardian pursuant to P.L.1985, c.298 (C.52:27G-20 et seq.) or their  representatives which may include a private or public agency, visits the ward not less than once every three months, or as deemed appropriate by the court, and otherwise maintain sufficient contact with the ward to know [his] the wards capacities, limitations, needs, opportunities, and physical and mental health; (3)   provide for the care, comfort and maintenance, and, whenever appropriate, the education and training of the ward; (4)   subject to the provisions of subsection c. of N.J.S.3B:12-56, give or withhold any consents or approvals that may be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment, or service; (5)   take reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles and other personal effects, and, where appropriate, sell or dispose of such effects to meet the current needs of the ward; (6)   institute an action for the appointment of a guardian of the property of the ward, if necessary for the protection of the property; (7)   develop a plan of supportive services for the needs of the ward and a plan to obtain the supportive services; (8)   if necessary, institute an action against a person having a duty to support the ward or to pay any sum for the ward's welfare in order to compel the performance of the duties; (9)   receive money, payable from any source for the current support of the ward, and tangible personal property deliverable to the ward.  Any sums so received shall be applied to the ward's current needs for support, health care, education, and training in the exercise of the guardian's reasonable discretion, with or without court order, with or without regard to the duty or ability of any person to support or provide for the ward and with or without regard to any other funds, income, or property that may be available for that purpose, unless an application is made to the court to establish a supplemental needs trust or other trust arrangement.  However, the guardian may not use funds from the ward's estate for room and board, which the guardian, the guardian's spouse or domestic partner as defined in section 3 of P.L.2003, c.246 (C.26:8A-3), or the wards parent or child have furnished the ward, unless agreed to by a guardian of the ward's estate pursuant to N.J.S.3B:12-41, or unless a charge for the service is approved by order of the court made upon notice to at least one of the heirs of the ward, if possible.  The guardian shall exercise care to conserve any excess funds for the ward's needs; and (10)    If necessary, institute an action that could be maintained by the ward including but not limited to, actions alleging fraud, abuse, undue influence, and exploitation. g.    In the exercise of the foregoing powers, the guardian shall: (1)   act, at all times, in the wards best interests; (2)   consider the expressed wishes and preferences of the ward, to the extent that the ward is capable of expressing those wishes and preferences, and encourage the ward to participate with the guardian in the decision-making process, to the maximum extent of the ward's ability [in order to]; and (3)   encourage the ward to act on [his] the wards own behalf, whenever [he] the ward is able to do so, and to develop or regain higher decision-making capacity [to make decisions], to the maximum extent practicable, in those areas in which [he] the ward is in need of guardianship services[, to the maximum extent possible]. (cf: P.L.2005, c.304, s.39) 9.    This act shall take effect on the 120th day after the date of enactment. STATEMENT The bill requires, in accordance with the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey: 1) a ward or proposed ward to be represented by counsel throughout the course of guardianship proceedings; 2) counsel to personally interview the ward or proposed ward; 3) If the ward or proposed ward is, at any time, not represented by counsel and is unable to afford counsel, the court to appoint counsel for the person; and 4) prior to the hearing date, counsel to file a report with the court in such a form and include all such provisions as required by the Administrative Director of the Courts. The bill further requires a court, in establishing a guardianship arrangement, to authorize only that level of intervention that the court finds to be least restrictive of the proposed wards rights while being consistent with the protection of the wards welfare and safety.  The bill clarifies that the court may, at any time, expand or limit the powers of the guardian or revoke or revise any previously ordered expansion or limitation of powers.  Under the bill, any proposed guardian is to comply with any applicable background screening policy for proposed guardians of incapacitated adults that is required by the Administrative Director of the Courts, including, but not limited to, fingerprinting. The bill also specifies that all actions undertaken by a guardian, whether by a guardian of the person or by a guardian of the estate, are to be undertaken with due regard to, and are to be consistent with, the wards best interests and the wards expressed wishes and preferences, to the extent that the ward is capable of expressing those wishes and preferences. Current law also requires a guardian to submit reports to the court, at time intervals ordered by the court, but it only imposes specific content requirements in association with reports that are submitted by guardians of the person; not guardians of the estate.  The existing law also authorizes the court to waive the reporting requirement entirely, and it does not require the court to actually review any of the submitted reports.  The bill would amend the law to:  1) eliminate the courts discretion to waive the reporting requirement but allow for judicial discretion in ordering a report; 2) require a report submitted by a guardian of the estate to be made in such a form as is required by the Administrative Director of the Courts and in accordance with the Court Rules, which is to state or contain information on the assets, income, disbursements, and liabilities of the guardianship estate; and 3) require the court to review the reports submitted pursuant to the bill, on at least an annual basis, in order to ensure that each guardian is properly fulfilling the guardians duties with respect to the ward or the wards estate, or both, as the case may be, and is operating in a manner consistent with the wards best interests.  The bill would also authorize the court, at any time, and would require the court whenever its annual review of the submitted reports reveals that the guardian may not be properly fulfilling the guardians duties or acting in the wards best interests, to appoint a third-party to interview the ward and the guardian, or undertake any other investigation the court may direct. The existing law requires a guardian of the estate to consider the recommendations of the wards parent or the guardian of the wards person when expending and distributing funds from the wards estate; however, an incapacitated person often does not have a living parent, and the guardian of the person may be the same as the guardian of the estate, meaning that, under existing law, there will often be no available third-party to provide recommendations to the guardian of the estate.  The bill would, therefore, amend the law to require the guardian of the estate to consider the recommendations of all of the following individuals:  1) the ward, to the extent that the ward is capable of making the recommendations; 2) if the ward is a minor, the wards parent; 3) if the ward is an incapacitated person, the spouse and any adult children of the ward or, if there are no adult children, the person or persons who are closest in degree of kinship to the ward; 4) the guardian of the wards person; and 5) the person or persons with whom the ward resides or, if the ward resides in an institution, the chief administrator of that institution.  This change will make the law consistent with the law pertaining to conservatorship, which requires a conservator to consider the recommendations of all these persons.  The bill also explicitly requires that the expenditure or distribution of funds from a wards estate to household members outside of the guardian are only to occur pursuant to order of the court. The bill also amends the existing guardianship law to modernize and clarify the existing language and paragraph and sentence structure and ensure that language is used consistently and in an active and direct voice throughout the law.
