<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill reallocates that $400
million in tax credits, which are currently authorized for the
Community-Anchored Development Program and Cultural Arts Incentives Program, to
the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) and sold through a
competitive tax credit auction.  The proceeds from the sale of tax credits at
auction are to be used by the HMFA to support the development of middle-income workforce
housing in the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the New
Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 has authorized $1.2 billion in tax
credits over a nine-year period for the Community-Anchored Development
Program.  As amended by P.L.2023, c.197, the law also allows a portion of the
tax credits allocated for the Community-Anchored Development Program to be used
to support tax credit awards for projects through the Cultural Arts Incentives
Program.  However, tax credits are not authorized to be awarded under the Community-Anchored
Development Program until beginning on January 1, 2026, and no projects have
been awarded tax credits under the Cultural Arts Incentives Program as of
November 2024.  Under this bill, $400 million in tax credits will be
transferred from these two programs to the HMFA in order to support middle-income
workforce housing programs administered by the HMFA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, this bill
requires the HMFA to sell up to $400 million in tax credits through a
competitive auction process.  Under the bill, this auction is to be conducted
in a manner consistent with the auctions held by the EDA under the New Jersey
Innovation Evergreen Program, except that the tax credits could not be sold for
a consideration less than 85 percent of the tax credit amount, and no more than
$75 million in tax credits may be sold at auction annually.  This bill also
permits the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury to purchase unused tax credits awarded under the provisions of this
bill.  The bill also provides that certain of these tax credits may be sold or
transferred by the recipient, subject to certain restrictions specified in this
bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the HMFA is
required to use the proceeds of tax credit auctions for the purposes of
providing financial assistance to support the development of middle-income workforce
housing in the State, including, but not limited to, the rehabilitation or
construction of residential units within multiple dwellings located within
areas with proximity to existing public transportation and job opportunities.  The
bill defines middle-income workforce housing to mean housing that is
deed-restricted for occupancy by households with a gross household income of 80
percent or more, but not exceeding 120 percent, of the median gross household
income for households of the same size within the housing region in which the
housing is located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
HMFA may use the proceeds from the competitive tax credit auction to support an
existing program operated by the HMFA or through the establishment of a new
program to effectuate the provisions of this bill.  Notably, the HMFA currently
operates the Workforce Housing Program, which provides loans to fund eligible
projects that include the rehabilitation and construction of residential units
that are reserved for middle-income workforce housing, also known as workforce
housing, within multiple dwellings located within areas with proximity to
existing public transportation and job opportunities.</p>
