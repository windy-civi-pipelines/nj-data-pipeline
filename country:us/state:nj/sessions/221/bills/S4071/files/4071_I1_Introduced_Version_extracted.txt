STATEMENT This bill reallocates that $400 million in tax credits, which are currently authorized for the Community-Anchored Development Program and Cultural Arts Incentives Program, to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) and sold through a competitive tax credit auction.  The proceeds from the sale of tax credits at auction are to be used by the HMFA to support the development of middle-income workforce housing in the State. Under current law, the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 has authorized $1.2 billion in tax credits over a nine-year period for the Community-Anchored Development Program.  As amended by P.L.2023, c.197, the law also allows a portion of the tax credits allocated for the Community-Anchored Development Program to be used to support tax credit awards for projects through the Cultural Arts Incentives Program.  However, tax credits are not authorized to be awarded under the Community-Anchored Development Program until beginning on January 1, 2026, and no projects have been awarded tax credits under the Cultural Arts Incentives Program as of November 2024.  Under this bill, $400 million in tax credits will be transferred from these two programs to the HMFA in order to support middle-income workforce housing programs administered by the HMFA. Specifically, this bill requires the HMFA to sell up to $400 million in tax credits through a competitive auction process.  Under the bill, this auction is to be conducted in a manner consistent with the auctions held by the EDA under the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Program, except that the tax credits could not be sold for a consideration less than 85 percent of the tax credit amount, and no more than $75 million in tax credits may be sold at auction annually.  This bill also permits the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to purchase unused tax credits awarded under the provisions of this bill.  The bill also provides that certain of these tax credits may be sold or transferred by the recipient, subject to certain restrictions specified in this bill. Under the bill, the HMFA is required to use the proceeds of tax credit auctions for the purposes of providing financial assistance to support the development of middle-income workforce housing in the State, including, but not limited to, the rehabilitation or construction of residential units within multiple dwellings located within areas with proximity to existing public transportation and job opportunities.  The bill defines middle-income workforce housing to mean housing that is deed-restricted for occupancy by households with a gross household income of 80 percent or more, but not exceeding 120 percent, of the median gross household income for households of the same size within the housing region in which the housing is located. The bill provides that the HMFA may use the proceeds from the competitive tax credit auction to support an existing program operated by the HMFA or through the establishment of a new program to effectuate the provisions of this bill.  Notably, the HMFA currently operates the Workforce Housing Program, which provides loans to fund eligible projects that include the rehabilitation and construction of residential units that are reserved for middle-income workforce housing, also known as workforce housing, within multiple dwellings located within areas with proximity to existing public transportation and job opportunities.

(2)   The authority may in any given year determine that it is in the State's interest to approve an amount of tax credits in excess of the annual limitations set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but in no event more than $200,000,000 in excess of the annual limitation, upon a determination by the authority board that such increase is warranted based on specific criteria that may include: (i)    the increased demand for opportunities to create or retain employment and investment in the State as indicated by the volume of project applications and the amount of tax credits being sought by those applications; (ii)   the need to protect the State's economic position in the event of an economic downturn; (iii) the quality of project applications and the net economic benefit to the State and municipalities associated with those applications; (iv)  opportunities for project applications to strengthen or protect the competitiveness of the State under the prevailing market conditions; (v)   enhanced access to employment and investment for underserved populations in distressed municipalities and qualified incentives tracts; (vi)  increased investment and employment in high-growth technology sectors and in projects that entail collaboration with education institutions in the State; (vii)  increased development proximate to mass transit facilities; (viii)  any other factor deemed relevant by the authority. c.     In the event that the authority in any year approves projects for tax credits in an amount less than the annual limitations set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, then the uncommitted portion of the annual limitation shall be available to be deployed by the authority in future years for projects under the same program; provided however, that in no event shall the aggregate amount of tax credits approved be in excess of the overall cap of $11.5 billion, and in no event shall the uncommitted portion of the annual limitation for any previous year be deployed after the conclusion of the nine-year period. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, the uncommitted balance of the total value of tax credits authorized for award by the authority pursuant to subparagraph (f) of paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section to the "New Jersey Aspire Program Act," sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 et seq.), and the "Emerge Program Act," sections 68 through 81 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-336 et al.), shall be made available for tax credits allowed to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, and taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of P.L.2018, c.56 (C.54:10A-5.39b and C.54A:4-12b).  The value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, made available to New Jersey studio partners, New Jersey film-lease production companies, and taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies pursuant to this subsection shall be as follows: (1)   in fiscal year 2023, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners and $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies; (2)   in fiscal year 2024, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners and $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies; and (3)   in fiscal year 2025, $250,000,000 for New Jersey studio partners, $250,000,000 for New Jersey film-lease production companies, and $300,000,000 for taxpayers, other than New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies. If the value of tax credits, including tax credits allowed through the granting of tax credit transfer certificates, approved to New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection is less than the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved in that fiscal year, the authority shall certify the amount of the remaining tax credits available for approval to each such category in that fiscal year, and shall increase the cumulative total amount of tax credits permitted to be approved for New Jersey studio partners and New Jersey film-lease production companies in the subsequent fiscal year by the certified amount remaining for each such category from the prior fiscal year.

STATEMENT This bill reallocates that $400 million in tax credits, which are currently authorized for the Community-Anchored Development Program and Cultural Arts Incentives Program, to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) and sold through a competitive tax credit auction.  The proceeds from the sale of tax credits at auction are to be used by the HMFA to support the development of middle-income workforce housing in the State. Under current law, the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020 has authorized $1.2 billion in tax credits over a nine-year period for the Community-Anchored Development Program.  As amended by P.L.2023, c.197, the law also allows a portion of the tax credits allocated for the Community-Anchored Development Program to be used to support tax credit awards for projects through the Cultural Arts Incentives Program.  However, tax credits are not authorized to be awarded under the Community-Anchored Development Program until beginning on January 1, 2026, and no projects have been awarded tax credits under the Cultural Arts Incentives Program as of November 2024.  Under this bill, $400 million in tax credits will be transferred from these two programs to the HMFA in order to support middle-income workforce housing programs administered by the HMFA. Specifically, this bill requires the HMFA to sell up to $400 million in tax credits through a competitive auction process.  Under the bill, this auction is to be conducted in a manner consistent with the auctions held by the EDA under the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Program, except that the tax credits could not be sold for a consideration less than 85 percent of the tax credit amount, and no more than $75 million in tax credits may be sold at auction annually.  This bill also permits the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to purchase unused tax credits awarded under the provisions of this bill.  The bill also provides that certain of these tax credits may be sold or transferred by the recipient, subject to certain restrictions specified in this bill. Under the bill, the HMFA is required to use the proceeds of tax credit auctions for the purposes of providing financial assistance to support the development of middle-income workforce housing in the State, including, but not limited to, the rehabilitation or construction of residential units within multiple dwellings located within areas with proximity to existing public transportation and job opportunities.  The bill defines middle-income workforce housing to mean housing that is deed-restricted for occupancy by households with a gross household income of 80 percent or more, but not exceeding 120 percent, of the median gross household income for households of the same size within the housing region in which the housing is located. The bill provides that the HMFA may use the proceeds from the competitive tax credit auction to support an existing program operated by the HMFA or through the establishment of a new program to effectuate the provisions of this bill.  Notably, the HMFA currently operates the Workforce Housing Program, which provides loans to fund eligible projects that include the rehabilitation and construction of residential units that are reserved for middle-income workforce housing, also known as workforce housing, within multiple dwellings located within areas with proximity to existing public transportation and job opportunities.
