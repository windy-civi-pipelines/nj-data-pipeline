<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the
&quot;Homestead School Property Tax Reimbursement Act,&quot; would reduce the
school property tax burden on senior residents of the State who are 65 years or
older by 50%. The bill provides a reimbursement for property taxes paid to
eligible claimants from the Casino Revenue Fund.  The bill phases in
eligibility over a three-year period through income limits.  For the first
year, only seniors with incomes of $35,000 or less would be eligible for the
reimbursement.  The income limit rises to $75,000 for the second year and there
is no income limit for the third year and thereafter.  A surviving spouse who
is at least 55 years of age also would qualify for the reimbursement.  The
Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury would be
responsible for promulgating application forms for the reimbursement and
issuing rules and regulations.</p>
