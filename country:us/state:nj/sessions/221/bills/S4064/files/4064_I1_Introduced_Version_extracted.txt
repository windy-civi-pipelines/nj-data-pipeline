STATEMENT Under current law, public bodies must provide notice to newspapers 48 hours prior to holding a meeting to conduct official business, under certain circumstances.  This bill amends the definition of "adequate notice" for a public meeting to allow public bodies to satisfy their meeting notice requirements by publishing the notice in newspapers that are published in part or in whole electronically via the Internet and on online news publications. This bill also amends the definition of "newspaper" for the publication of all official notices and advertisements to allow the State or local bodies to publish in qualified or previously qualified newspapers that are now published electronically on the Internet and on online news publications. The bill also adds definitions for "designated public address," "original content," and "paid online content." In cases where there is no qualified newspaper or the State or local body is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, the State or local body may publish on their publicly accessible Internet website. The bill establishes rates for publishing official advertising for newspapers and online news publications based on the number of bona fide net paid subscribers.

The bill also adds definitions for "designated public address," "original content," and "paid online content." In cases where there is no qualified newspaper or the State or local body is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, the State or local body may publish on their publicly accessible Internet website. The bill establishes rates for publishing official advertising for newspapers and online news publications based on the number of bona fide net paid subscribers.
