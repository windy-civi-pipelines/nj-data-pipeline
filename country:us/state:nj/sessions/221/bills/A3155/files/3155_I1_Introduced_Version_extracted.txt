(1)   A private person who is summoned by a peace officer to assist in effecting an unlawful arrest is justified in using [any] force, other than deadly force, which [he] the person would be justified in using if the arrest were lawful, provided that [he] the person does not believe the arrest is unlawful. (2)   A private person who assists another private person in effecting an unlawful arrest, or who, not being summoned, assists a peace officer in effecting an unlawful arrest, is justified in using [any] force, other than deadly force, which [he] the person would be justified in using if the arrest were lawful, provided that (a) [he] the person reasonably believes the arrest is lawful, and (b) the arrest would be lawful if the facts  were as [he] the person believes them to be and such belief is reasonable. e.     Use of force to prevent suicide or the commission of a crime.

(cf: P.L.1981, c.290, s.5) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill eliminates making an arrest or preventing an escape as justification for the use deadly force. Under current law, the use of deadly force is justified when used to make an arrest under certain circumstances.  Specifically, the use of deadly force to effectuate an arrest is justified if the actor effecting the arrest is authorized to act as a peace officer, or has been summoned by and is assisting a peace officer, and reasonably believes that: · the force creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons and that the crime for which the arrest is made was homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, criminal sexual contact, arson, robbery, or burglary of a dwelling; and · there is an imminent threat of deadly force to the actor or a third party;  or · the use of deadly force is necessary to thwart the commission of a crime. A correctional police officer, or person authorized to act as a peace officer, is justified in using deadly force under current law if the officer or authorized person reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary to prevent the escape of a person committed to a jail, prison, or other institution for the detention of persons charged with or  convicted of an offense, so long as the actor believes that the force employed creates no substantial risk of injury to an innocent person. This bill amends current law to provide that the use of deadly force to effectuate an arrest is only justified if there is an imminent threat of deadly force to the person using force or a third party.  The bill also provides that the use of deadly force may not be used to prevent the escape of a person charged or convicted of an offense.
