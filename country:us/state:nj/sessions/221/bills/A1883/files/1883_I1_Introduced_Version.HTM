Except as otherwise provided in this section, a social media platform shall not use any practice, design, feature, or affordance that the owner or operator of the platform knew, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should have known, would cause child users to become addicted to the platform. b.   A social media platform shall not be deemed to violate the provisions of subsection a. of this section if: (1)  the owner or operator of the social media platform demonstrates that the platform: (a)  has instituted and maintains an audit program in which the owner or operator of the platform hires an independent third party to conduct an annual audit of its practices, designs, features, or affordances to determine whether these practices, designs, features, or affordances cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to the addition of child users to the platform; (b)  does not use a practice, design, feature, or affordance that causes or is likely to cause the addiction of child users to the platform; and (c) if an audit determines that any practice, design, feature, or affordance used by the platform causes, has the potential to cause, or contributes to the addiction of child users, the owner or operator of the platform corrects the practice, design, feature, or affordance within 30 calendar days of the completion of the audit; (2)  the social media platform is controlled by a business entity that generated less than $100 million in gross revenue during the preceding calendar year; or (3)  the primary function of the social media platform is to enable users to play video games. c.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the owner or operator of a social media platform for: (1)  any content that is generated, uploaded, or shared on the social media platform by a user of the platform; (2)  any content that is created solely by a third party and passively displayed by the social media platform; (3)  any information or content for which the social media platform was not, in whole or in part, responsible for creating or developing; and (4)  any conduct involving child users that would otherwise be protected by 47 U.S.C. s.230, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, or Article I, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution. d.    The owner or operator of a social media platform that violates the provisions of subsection a. of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty, not to exceed $250,000 per violation, to be collected in a civil action by a summary proceeding under the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.).  The Superior Court and the municipal court shall have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999 pursuant to this subsection. 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT The bill prohibits the owner or operator of a social media platform from using any practice, design, feature, or affordance that would cause child users to become addicted to the platform.  Under the bill, the owner or operator of the social media platform would be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $250,000 for each violation. However, the platform would not be deemed to violate the provisions of the bill if the owner or operator of the platform hires an independent third party to conduct an annual audit to determine whether any of its practices, designs, features, or affordances would cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to the addiction of child users to the platform, and the owner or operator of the platform demonstrates that the platform does not use a practice, design, feature, or affordance that causes, or is likely to cause, the addiction of child users to the platform.  If an audit reveals that a practice, design, feature, or affordance has the potential to cause or contributes to child user addiction, the owner or operator of the social media platform would also be required to correct the practice, design, feature, or affordance within 30 calendar days of the completion of the audit. The bill also requires that a social medial platform demonstrate that it does not use a practice, design, feature, or affordance that causes, or is likely to cause, the addiction of child users to the platform. Additionally, certain social media platforms would not be subject to the requirements of the bill.  These social media platforms would include any platform that is controlled by a business entity that generated less than $100 million in gross revenue during the preceding calendar year, or any platform whose primary function is to enable users to play video games. The bill also clarifies that the owner or operator of a social media platform would not be subject to liability under this bill for: (1) any content generated, uploaded, or shared by users of the platform; (2) any content that is created by third-party entities and passively displayed by the platform; (3) any information or content for which the platform was not responsible for creating and developing; and (4) any conduct involving child users that would otherwise be protected under certain federal law, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, or Article I, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution.
