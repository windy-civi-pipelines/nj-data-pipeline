This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances penalties related to threats and other improper influence on public officials. Under current law, it is a third degree crime if a person, directly or indirectly, threatens unlawful harm to any person with the purpose to influence a decision, opinion, vote or exercise of discretion in a judicial or administrative proceeding or of a public servant, party official or voter, or with the purpose to influence the person to violate official duties. Under the bill, it is a second degree crime if such acts are committed against a judicial officer, prosecutor, or the immediate family member of such.  It is a first degree crime if such acts are committed against judicial officers, prosecutors, or immediate family members within 500 feet of the victims residence. Further, the bill provides that a judgment of conviction for such crime operates as an application for a permanent restraining order limiting the contact of the defendant and the victim. The bill establishes that a person who commits the first or second degree crimes of threatening a judicial officer or prosecutor established under the bill, is barred from possessing or owning any weapons, and provides that law enforcement has the authority to seize any weapons and ammunition on the persons property and seize any firearm purchaser identification card.  The seizure of such weapons and identification card are subject to judicial review. Moreover, the bill establishes the crime of doxxing.  Under the bill, doxxing occurs if a person, with the purpose to subject another person to violence, stalking, physical restraining, mental anguish, or to cause a person to fear for their own safety or that of another, knowingly discloses personal identifying information without the persons consent.  A crime is committed under the bill when the disclosure: (1) creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or physical harm to the person or a close relation of the person; (2)   creates a substantial risk that the person or a close relation of the person would, as a result of the disclosure, be subjected to stalking; or (3) inflicts mental anguish upon the person or a close relation of the person and places the person or close relation in reasonable fear of physical harm. Doxxing is a crime of the fourth degree unless the disclosure results in any serious bodily injury, physical harm, or stalking, at which time it becomes a crime of the third degree. Finally, the bill expands N.J.S.A.2C:20-31.1, which establishes criminal penalties related to the disclosure of personal identifying information to include instances where a person takes such personal identifying information and with the purpose to harass a covered person or an immediate family member, the person knowingly (1) and repeatedly send, deliver, or cause to be delivered any items, substances, or written materials to the covered person or an immediate family member; (2) initiates or cause repeated communications to covered persons or immediately family members home address or unpublished telephone number; or (3) engages in a pattern of conduct directed at the covered person or an immediate family member of the covered person that uses or exploits such personal identifying information to invade the covered persons or immediate family members personal privacy.  A violation of this provision is a crime of the third degree. A first degree crime is punishable by up to 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.    A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.

This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill enhances penalties related to threats and other improper influence on public officials. Under current law, it is a third degree crime if a person, directly or indirectly, threatens unlawful harm to any person with the purpose to influence a decision, opinion, vote or exercise of discretion in a judicial or administrative proceeding or of a public servant, party official or voter, or with the purpose to influence the person to violate official duties. Under the bill, it is a second degree crime if such acts are committed against a judicial officer, prosecutor, or the immediate family member of such.  It is a first degree crime if such acts are committed against judicial officers, prosecutors, or immediate family members within 500 feet of the victims residence. Further, the bill provides that a judgment of conviction for such crime operates as an application for a permanent restraining order limiting the contact of the defendant and the victim. The bill establishes that a person who commits the first or second degree crimes of threatening a judicial officer or prosecutor established under the bill, is barred from possessing or owning any weapons, and provides that law enforcement has the authority to seize any weapons and ammunition on the persons property and seize any firearm purchaser identification card.  The seizure of such weapons and identification card are subject to judicial review. Moreover, the bill establishes the crime of doxxing.  Under the bill, doxxing occurs if a person, with the purpose to subject another person to violence, stalking, physical restraining, mental anguish, or to cause a person to fear for their own safety or that of another, knowingly discloses personal identifying information without the persons consent.  A crime is committed under the bill when the disclosure: (1) creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or physical harm to the person or a close relation of the person; (2)   creates a substantial risk that the person or a close relation of the person would, as a result of the disclosure, be subjected to stalking; or (3) inflicts mental anguish upon the person or a close relation of the person and places the person or close relation in reasonable fear of physical harm. Doxxing is a crime of the fourth degree unless the disclosure results in any serious bodily injury, physical harm, or stalking, at which time it becomes a crime of the third degree. Finally, the bill expands N.J.S.A.2C:20-31.1, which establishes criminal penalties related to the disclosure of personal identifying information to include instances where a person takes such personal identifying information and with the purpose to harass a covered person or an immediate family member, the person knowingly (1) and repeatedly send, deliver, or cause to be delivered any items, substances, or written materials to the covered person or an immediate family member; (2) initiates or cause repeated communications to covered persons or immediately family members home address or unpublished telephone number; or (3) engages in a pattern of conduct directed at the covered person or an immediate family member of the covered person that uses or exploits such personal identifying information to invade the covered persons or immediate family members personal privacy.  A violation of this provision is a crime of the third degree. A first degree crime is punishable by up to 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.    A crime of the third degree is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by up to 18 months imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.
