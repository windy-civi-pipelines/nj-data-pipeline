another, knowingly discloses personal identifying information without the
persons consent.  A crime is committed under the bill when the disclosure:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) creates a substantial risk
of serious bodily injury or physical harm to the person or a close relation of
the person; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   creates a substantial
risk that the person or a close relation of the person would, as a result of
the disclosure, be subjected to stalking; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) inflicts mental anguish
upon the person or a close relation of the person and places the person or
close relation in reasonable fear of physical harm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Doxxing is a crime of the
fourth degree unless the disclosure results in any serious bodily injury,
physical harm, or stalking, at which time it becomes a crime of the third
degree.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill expands
N.J.S.A.2C:20-31.1, which establishes criminal penalties related to the
disclosure of personal identifying information to include instances where a
person takes such personal identifying information and with the purpose to
harass a covered person or an immediate family member, the person knowingly (1)
and repeatedly send, deliver, or cause to be delivered any items, substances,
or written materials to the covered person or an immediate family member; (2)
initiates or cause repeated communications to covered persons or immediately
family members home address or unpublished telephone number; or (3) engages in
a pattern of conduct directed at the covered person or an immediate family
member of the covered person that uses or exploits such personal identifying
information to invade the covered persons or immediate family members personal
privacy.  A violation of this provision is a crime of the third degree. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A first degree crime is
punishable by up to 10 to 20 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $200,000, or
both.  A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years
imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.    A crime of the third degree
is punishable by three to five years imprisonment, a fine of up to $15,000, or
