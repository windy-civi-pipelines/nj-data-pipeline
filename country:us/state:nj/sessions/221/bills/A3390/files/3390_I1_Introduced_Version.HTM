<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 4 of P.L.2014,
c.31 (C.2A:162-18) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  (1)  The court may
order, before trial, the detention of an eligible defendant charged with any
crime, or any offense involving domestic violence as defined in subsection a.
of section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), enumerated in subsection a. of
section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19), if the prosecutor seeks the pretrial
detention of the eligible defendant under section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31
(C.2A:162-19) and after a hearing pursuant to  that section the court finds
clear and convincing evidence that no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary
conditions of pretrial release or combination of monetary bail and conditions
would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when
required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community,
and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the
criminal justice process. The court may also order the pretrial detention of an
eligible defendant when the prosecutor moves for a pretrial detention hearing
and the eligible defendant fails to rebut a presumption of pretrial detention
that may be established for the crimes enumerated under subsection b. of
section 5 of P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-19).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   For purposes of ordering
the pretrial detention of an eligible defendant pursuant to this section and

P.L.2014, c.31 (C.2A:162-24), when determining whether no amount of monetary
bail, non-monetary conditions or combination of monetary bail and conditions
would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when
required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or
that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the
criminal justice process, the court may consider the amount of monetary bail
only with respect to whether it will, by itself or in combination with
non-monetary conditions, reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance
in court when required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Regarding the pretrial
detention hearing moved for by the prosecutor, except for when an eligible
defendant is charged with a crime set forth under paragraph (1) <b><span

when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the
community, and that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to
obstruct the criminal justice process. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a rebuttable
presumption that a person charged with theft of a motor vehicle is to be
detained prior to trial, and imposes mandatory sentencing for motor vehicle
theft under N.J.S.2C:20-2, and unlawful taking of a means of conveyance, or
joyriding, under N.J.S.2C:20-10.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a person is
guilty of theft of a motor vehicle if the person unlawfully takes, or exercises
unlawful control over, another persons motor vehicle with the purpose to
deprive that person of the motor vehicle. Theft of a motor vehicle is a crime
of the third degree ordinarily punishable by up to five years imprisonment, a
fine of up to $15,000, or both.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under P.L.2014, c.31, also
known as the Criminal Justice Reform Law, criminal courts are authorized to
order the pretrial release of a defendant pending further proceedings, or order
pretrial detention of defendants who are found to be a flight risk, a danger to
another or the community, or likely to obstruct further criminal proceedings.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, if a court
finds probable cause that a defendant was guilty of theft of a motor vehicle,
there would be a rebuttable presumption that the person is to be detained
pending trial because no amount of monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of
release, or combination thereof would reasonably assure the safety of any other
person or the community.  The presumption may be rebutted by the defendant upon
a showing of a preponderance of the evidence in support of the defendant.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This rebuttable presumption
applies under current law when a prosecutor makes a motion for the pretrial
detention of a defendant charged with murder or any crime for which the
defendant would be subject to an ordinary or extended term of life
imprisonment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill further imposes
mandatory sentencing for motor vehicle theft under N.J.S.2C:20-2, and unlawful
taking of a means of conveyance, or joyriding, under N.J.S.2C:20-10.  Under
the bill, the term of imprisonment is to include the imposition of a minimum
term fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed by
the court.  For a second conviction under either statute, the minimum term is
to be fixed at one-half of the sentence imposed by the court, or 30 months for
a crime of the third degree, whichever is greater.  For a second conviction of
a crime of the fourth degree, a minimum term fixed at one half of the sentence
imposed by the court or nine months, whichever is greater.  For a third or
subsequent conviction, the minimum term shall be fixed at five years, for a
crime of the third degree, and 18 months for a crime of the fourth degree.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under paragraph (2) of
subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-2, theft of a motor vehicle is currently graded as
a crime of the third degree which is ordinarily punishable by three to five
years imprisonment, a fine of up to $10,000 or both.  Under N.J.S.2C:20-10 the
unlawful taking of a motor vehicle is graded as a crime of the third or the
fourth degree depending on the attendant circumstances. Under subsection e. of
N.J.S.2C:44-1, theft of a motor vehicle and unlawful taking of a means of
conveyance are presently excluded from the presumption of non-imprisonment
ordinarily applicable to a crime of the third or fourth degree, meaning there
is no presumption either of imprisonment or non-imprisonment.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors view that
imposing mandatory sentencing for these crimes is necessary to eliminate the
incentive to commit a motor vehicle theft offense with no risk of
incarceration.</p>
