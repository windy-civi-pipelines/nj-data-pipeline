CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning veterinary care and supplementing Title 26 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in this act: Charity care program means the State program providing free or reduced cost care at disproportionate share hospitals that may be eligible for a charity care subsidy pursuant to P.L.1992, c.160 (C.26:2H-18.51 et al.) for individuals who meet the income, asset, and insurance status criteria established by the Commissioner of Health. Exotic animal means any species of mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish, mollusk, or crustacean that is not indigenous to New Jersey as determined by the Fish and Game Council in rules and regulations adopted pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," and shall include the young or eggs of any such species, but shall not include (1) domesticated companion animals or farm livestock as defined by the Fish and Game Council, or (2) fish, shellfish, or game species not indigenous to New Jersey for which fishing, harvesting, hunting, or trapping is authorized and regulated pursuant to law, the State Fish and Game Code, or rules and regulations of the Fish and Game Council. Pet means any animal that has been bought, bred, raised or otherwise acquired, in accordance with local ordinances and State and federal law, for the primary purpose of providing companionship to the owner, rather than for business or agricultural purposes. For the purposes of this act, pet does not include exotic animals. 2.    a.  The Commissioner of Health shall establish a program whereby individuals who qualify for free or reduced-cost hospital care under the States charity care program will qualify for free or reduced-cost emergency veterinary services for their pets at veterinary hospitals located in the State that participate in the program, pursuant to subsection c. of this section. b.    (1)  Individuals who meet the income and asset eligibility criteria for free or reduced cost care under P.L.1992, c.160 (C.26:2H-18.51 et al.), may apply to the Department of Health for free or reduced cost emergency veterinary services for their pets on a form and in a manner that shall be determined by the commissioner.

This act shall take effect on the first day of the ninth month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Health may take any anticipatory administrative action in advance as shall be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT The bill requires the Commissioner of Health (commissioner) to establish a program under which low-income individuals who qualify for free or reduced-cost hospital care under the States charity care program will also qualify for free or reduced-cost emergency veterinary care for their pets at certain veterinary hospitals located in the State.  Pet is defined as any animal that has been bought, bred, raised or acquired, in compliance with local ordinances and State and federal law, for the primary purpose of providing companionship, rather than for business or agricultural purposes.  For the purposes of the bill, pet does not include exotic animals. The States charity care program allows low-income patients without health insurance coverage to receive hospital care at zero or reduced cost, on a sliding scale depending on the patients income. To be eligible for the charity care program, an individual must have an annual income equal to, or below, 300 percent of the federal poverty level, and limited assets. The charity care program also stipulates that eligible patients have no health insurance coverage or coverage for only a portion of their hospital bill, and not be eligible for any governmental or privately sponsored coverage, such as Medicaid. The bill provides that individuals who meet the income and asset criteria for the States charity care program may apply to the Department of Health (DOH) for free or reduced cost emergency veterinary services for their pets on a form and in a manner determined by the commissioner.  Individuals who have purchased a pet health insurance policy that covers emergency veterinary services, however, will not be eligible for free or reduced-cost emergency veterinary services under the program.  Veterinary hospitals that want to provide emergency care under the program will submit an application to the DOH on a form and in manner determined by the commissioner. The commissioner will develop a methodology to determine the allocation of appropriated funds to participating veterinary hospitals and a process by which participating veterinary hospitals will receive subsidy payments for emergency care provided under the program.  The bill additionally appropriates such sums as necessary to implement the program, as determined by the commissioner.
