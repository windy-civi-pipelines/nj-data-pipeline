Under current law, the board may approve a petition by an electric public utility to increase, change, or alter any existing utility rates upon determination that the increase, change, or alteration is just and reasonable.  Currently, the primary factors considered by the board in the determination of justness and reasonableness include the public utilitys property valuation (i.e., the rate base), the public utilitys expenses, and the public utilitys rate of return.
