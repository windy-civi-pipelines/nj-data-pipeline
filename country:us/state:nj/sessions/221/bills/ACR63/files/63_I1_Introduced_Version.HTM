(a)  The people of this State find and declare that:</p>

style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>All political power is

benefit of the people; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>The people of this State
have reserved to themselves, as part of their intrinsic sovereignty, the right
to alter or reform the State Constitution when the public good may require it;
and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>The current system of
property taxation in this State is unfair because it is not based on the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>There is a need to revise
and amend the State Constitution and the statutes to lessen the dependence of
local government on property taxes, reduce property taxes as a share of overall
public revenue, and find alternative means of funding local government
services; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span

style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>The Legislature, when
considering proposals for broad restructuring of revenue sources, recognizes
that there is great political risk in making recommendations which the general
public might perceive as increasing taxes; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span

style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>The most effective way to
have maximum participation is a public vote on whether or not to proceed with
the process of reducing government spending and reforming property taxes and,
if this question is approved, another vote by the public to ratify the
recommendations for tax and spending reform; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.2in;text-indent:-.2in;line-height:150%'><b><span
style='font-variant:small-caps'>Whereas, </span></b>The convening of a
constitutional convention for the purpose of recommending amendments to the New
Jersey Constitution and changes to the statutes is the most appropriate method
for building a consensus for, and implementing, reform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   A constitutional
convention shall convene in New Brunswick at Rutgers, the State University, or
if a suitable facility at Rutgers is unavailable at a location selected by the
Governor, on a date next following voter approval of this paragraph, to be
selected by the Attorney General, for the purpose of proposing amendments to
the New Jersey Constitution, and changes to the statutes, which revise the
system of property taxation and reduce government spending in this State,
following approval by the voters of the holding of such a convention and the
election of delegates thereto in the manner provided herein.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The convention shall
recommend amendments to the New Jersey Constitution and revisions to the
statutes that reduce government spending by revising the spending priorities of
the State and local governments, and providing other opportunities to reduce spending
by government, and which, while revenue neutral in their overall impact,
eliminate inequities in the current system of property taxation, ensure greater
uniformity in the application of property taxes, reduce property taxes as a
share of overall public revenue, provide alternatives which lessen the
dependence of local government on property taxes, and provide alternative means
of reducing local government spending.  As used in this paragraph,
&quot;revenue neutral&quot; means that the aggregate amount of all revenues
enacted under the powers of the State, as accurately as can be estimated and
measured, shall be the same after changes recommended by the convention as they
were before such changes. The convention shall not consider or recommend any
proposal providing for a Statewide equalized school property tax.  The
convention shall be limited to considering and making recommendations in regard
to the aforesaid matters and the implementation thereof.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   The convention shall
complete and agree upon its proposals on a date in August selected by the
Attorney General next following its convening and provide for the submission
thereof at the next general election, for approval or rejection by the voters. 
The<u> </u>convention shall have the authority to propose for voter approval at
the general election the amendment or repeal of existing statutes or the
enactment of new statutes which are within the scope of the convention's
mandate.  Any such changes to the statutory law approved by the voters may
thereafter be amended or repealed by the Legislature by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   Following approval by
the voters of the holding a constitutional convention, a special election shall

provide for the convening of a State constitutional convention for the purpose
of reducing government spending and reforming the system of property taxation
in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Upon approval by the electorate

elected from each legislative district, for a total of 80 delegates, at a
special election held in March thereafter.  The names of candidates for
delegate on the ballot would rotate in successive election districts in order

revising the spending priorities of the State and local governments, and
providing other opportunities to reduce spending by government and which, while
revenue neutral in their overall impact, eliminate inequities in the current
system of property taxation, ensure greater uniformity in the application of
property taxes, reduce property taxes as a share of overall public revenue,
provide alternatives which lessen the dependence of local government on
property taxes, and provide alternative means of reducing local government
spending.  Any revisions of the statutes recommended by the convention and
approved by the voters at the following general election would thereafter be
subject to amendment or repeal by the Legislature and the Governor in the same
manner as other laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The convention's proposal
would be submitted to the voters for their approval at the next general
election.  The voters would approve or disapprove of all the amendments and
statutory revisions proposed by the convention and would not be permitted to
approve some, but not all, of the conventions proposals. The convention would
be limited to considering the issues of reducing government spending and tax
reform.  It would not be permitted to consider any other issues.  The
concurrent resolution provides that the Chief Justice would appoint a committee
of three retired members of the Judiciary to review the convention's proposal
prior to its placement on the ballot for the purpose of verifying that the
convention has complied with its instructions and not exceeded those
instructions in any way.  It also directs the Legislative Services Commission

the convening of the convention and to recruit qualified employees who may be
employed by the convention.</p>
