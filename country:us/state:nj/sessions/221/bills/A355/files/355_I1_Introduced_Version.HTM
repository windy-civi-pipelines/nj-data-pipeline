<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
standards and requirements for volunteer and nonvolunteer first aid, rescue,
and ambulance squads under the New Jersey Highway Traffic Safety Act of 1987,
P.L.1987, c.284 (C.27:5F-18 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill would
revise the definition of a volunteer first aid, rescue, and ambulance squad
to mean any not-for-profit basic life support services organization whereby:
(1) at least 51 percent of coverage time is provided by crews comprised of
volunteers; or (2) the provider is a nonprofit organization or a political
subdivision that does not bill its patients for providing basic life support
services.  Under current law, the term is defined to mean a squad that does not
receive payment for providing emergency medical services.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also revise the
definition of nonvolunteer first aid, rescue, and ambulance squad to mean any
organization that provides basic life support services that does not qualify as
a voluntary first aid, rescue, and ambulance squad.  The term is currently
defined to mean a squad that provides emergency medical services on a paid
basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would define basic life
support, which is not currently defined in the New Jersey Highway Traffic
Safety Act of 1987, to mean a basic level of pre-hospital care which includes
patient stabilization, airway clearance, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
hemorrhage control, initial wound care and fracture stabilization, and other
techniques and procedures authorized by the Commissioner of Health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the EMS Council of
New Jersey is required to adopt a training program for members of volunteer
first aid, rescue, and ambulance squads.  This bill would require that, when
adopting a training program, the Council and the Department of Health must take
into consideration the national curriculum for emergency medical technicians
and other emergency medical responders.  In addition, the bill would require
that the impact on recruitment and retention of volunteers be considered before
adopting and implementing any new or revised training requirements or curricula
related to training materials, minimum class hours, training hours, or the
availability of training programs.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also clarify
that the training standards for both volunteer and nonvolunteer squads must
also comply with the written training standards for EMT-Basics promulgated by
the Commissioner of Health, which in turn must comply with the uniform
standards promulgated by the United States Secretary of Transportation in
accordance with the &quot;U.S. Highway Safety Act of 1966.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
officers of each volunteer and nonvolunteer first aid, rescue, and ambulance
squad are responsible for the training of its members, and must notify the
governing body of the political subdivision in which the squad is located that
the applicants, ambulances, and equipment meet the statutory requirements for
certification.  The bill would require that the officers additionally notify
the governing body of the training certifications and certification expiration
dates for each member, along with proofs of inspection for equipment.  The bill
additionally specifies that no volunteer or nonvolunteer first aid, rescue, or
ambulance squad may provide basic life support services unless that squad is
inspected and certified or otherwise authorized to do so by the Office of
Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health, or is inspected and
certified as a member in good standing of the EMS Council of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would additionally
provide that each volunteer or nonvolunteer first aid, rescue, and ambulance
squad include, at a minimum, one certified emergency medical technician who would
attend to the patient and be responsible for patient care at the scene of the
emergency and in the patient compartment while transporting the patient.  Current
regulations require that each basic life support ambulance be staffed with at
least two certified emergency medical technicians.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
that, in all cases when an ambulance is transporting a patient, the driver be
at least 18 years of age, hold a valid drivers license, have passed a CPR/AED
course for professional rescuers and health care providers approved by the
Office of Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>or by the EMS Council of New
Jersey, and have successfully completed a course in certified emergency vehicle
operations or defensive driving for emergency vehicles approved by the Office
of Emergency Medical Services in the Department of Health or the EMS Council of
New Jersey.  In addition, the bill would require that driver be familiar with
the ambulance and its contents.</p>
