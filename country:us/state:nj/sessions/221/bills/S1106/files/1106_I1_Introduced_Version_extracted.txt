S1106 SENATE, No. 1106 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  BRITNEE N. TIMBERLAKE District 34 (Essex) SYNOPSIS Concerns development and use of accessory dwelling units. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning accessory dwelling units, supplementing P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) and P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.), and amending P.L.1985, c.222. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that: (1)   Accessory dwelling units are a valuable form of housing and present a way to expand the States housing supply that is both cost-effective and consistent with sound planning and environmental principles. (2)   Accessory dwelling units provide housing for family members, the elderly, in-home health care providers, individuals with disabilities, households of low and moderate income, and others, often at below-market prices within existing neighborhoods. (3)   Homeowners who develop accessory dwelling units can benefit from added income and an increased sense of security. (4)   Allowing accessory dwelling units in single-family and two-family residential zones will make it possible to expand the state of New Jerseys rental housing stock, and meet current and future housing demand. (5)   Accessory dwelling units offer lower-cost housing within existing neighborhoods while maintaining the architectural character of a neighborhood. (6)   Accessory dwelling units should therefore be considered an essential component of New Jerseys housing supply. b.    It is the intent of the Legislature that municipal land use regulations shall provide for the creation of accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and that no provision of any such regulation shall restrict the ability of a property owner to develop accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L. , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 2.    (New section)  As used in sections 1 through 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      through C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Accessory dwelling unit means a residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation, and is located within a proposed or existing primary dwelling, within an existing or proposed accessory structure, constructed in whole or part as an extension to a proposed or existing primary dwelling, or constructed as a separate detached structure on the same lot as the existing or proposed primary dwelling. Accessory structure means a structure that is accessory and incidental to a dwelling located on the same lot. Buildable area means that area within the rear yard of a lot on which a primary dwelling is located that is beyond a five-foot setback line from the side and rear property lines. Commissioner means the Commissioner of Community Affairs. Department means the Department of Community Affairs. Primary dwelling means a single-family or two-family dwelling proposed or existing on a residential lot. Single-family dwelling means any structure that contains a single-family dwelling unit on an individual lot, including structures that are attached to other single-family dwellings with a common party wall commonly known as semi-detached houses, row houses or townhouses. Tandem parking means parking two or more automobiles on a driveway or another location on a lot, aligned so that one automobile is parked immediately behind the another. Two-family dwelling means any structure that contains two separate dwelling units on an individual lot, whether separated horizontally or vertically. 3.    (New section)  a.  A municipality may adopt or amend existing land use regulations to authorize a person to develop one or more accessory dwelling units on a lot owned by the person, and located within an area meeting the requirements of subsection c. of this section, in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures set forth in P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    A provision of a municipal land use regulation that is in place on the effective date of P.L. , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) but fails to comply with the requirements of P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be null, void, and unenforceable.  A municipality shall follow the requirements of P.L.   , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) when considering an application to develop an accessory dwelling unit, unless and until the municipality adopts or amends its land use regulations in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures set forth in P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     Except as otherwise provided in section 5 of P.L.  , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), land use regulations adopted or amended pursuant to P.L.    c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall provide that an accessory dwelling unit is a permitted use as of right on a lot if a primary dwelling exists or is being proposed on the lot, and the lot is located within a zone in which a single-family dwelling or a two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations.  An accessory dwelling unit shall be deemed to not exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which the accessory dwelling unit is proposed to be located or deemed to be the expansion of a prior nonconforming use. d.    The land use regulations shall also provide that: (1)  An accessory dwelling unit may be either located within or attached to the proposed or existing primary dwelling or to a proposed or existing garage or other accessory structure, or detached from the proposed or existing primary dwelling but located on the same lot as the proposed or existing primary dwelling.

Of those monies deposited into the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" that are derived from municipal development fee trust funds, or from available collections of Statewide non-residential development fees, a priority for funding shall be established for projects in municipalities that have petitioned the council for substantive certification. Programs and projects in any municipality shall be funded only after receipt by the commissioner of a written statement in support of the program or project from the municipal governing body. b.    The commissioner shall establish rules and regulations governing the qualifications of applicants, the application procedures, and the criteria for awarding grants and loans and the standards for establishing the amount, terms, and conditions of each grant or loan. c.     For any period which the council may approve, the commissioner may assist affordable housing programs which are not located in municipalities whose housing elements have been granted substantive certification or which are not in furtherance of a regional contribution agreement; provided that the affordable housing program will meet all or part of a municipal low and moderate income housing obligation. d.    Amounts deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" shall be targeted to regions based on the region's percentage of the State's low and moderate income housing need as determined by the council.  Amounts in the fund shall be applied for the following purposes in designated neighborhoods: (1)   Rehabilitation of substandard housing units occupied or to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (2)   Creation of accessory [apartments] dwelling units to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (3)   Conversion of non-residential space to residential purposes; provided a substantial percentage of the resulting housing units are to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (4)   Acquisition of real property, demolition and removal of buildings, or construction of new housing that will be occupied by low and moderate income households, or any combination thereof; (5)   Grants of assistance to eligible municipalities for costs of necessary studies, surveys, plans, and permits; engineering, architectural, and other technical services; costs of land acquisition and any buildings thereon; and costs of site preparation, demolition, and infrastructure development for projects undertaken pursuant to an approved regional contribution agreement; (6)   Assistance to a local housing authority, nonprofit or limited dividend housing corporation, or association or a qualified entity acting as a receiver under P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-114 et al.) for rehabilitation or restoration of housing units which it administers which: (a) are unusable or in a serious state of disrepair; (b) can be restored in an economically feasible and sound manner; and (c) can be retained in a safe, decent, and sanitary manner, upon completion of rehabilitation or restoration; and (7)   Other housing programs for low and moderate income housing, including, without limitation, (a) infrastructure projects directly facilitating the construction of low and moderate income housing not to exceed a reasonable percentage of the construction costs of the low and moderate income housing to be provided and (b) alteration of dwelling units occupied or to be occupied by households of low or moderate income and the common areas of the premises in which they are located in order to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. e.     Any grant or loan agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall incorporate contractual guarantees and procedures by which the division will ensure that any unit of housing provided for low and moderate income households shall continue to be occupied by low and moderate income households for at least 20 years following the award of the loan or grant, except that the division may approve a guarantee for a period of less than 20 years where necessary to ensure project feasibility. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, in making grants or loans under this section, the department shall not require that tenants be certified as low or moderate income or that contractual guarantees or deed restrictions be in place to ensure continued low and moderate income occupancy as a condition of providing housing assistance from any program administered by the department, when that assistance is provided for a project of moderate rehabilitation if the project: (1) contains 30 or fewer rental units; and (2) is located in a census tract in which the median household income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the housing region in which the census tract is located, as determined for a three person household by the council in accordance with the latest federal decennial census. A list of eligible census tracts shall be maintained by the department and shall be adjusted upon publication of median income figures by census tract after each federal decennial census. g.    In addition to other grants or loans awarded pursuant to this section, and without regard to any limitations on such grants or loans for any other purposes herein imposed, the commissioner shall annually allocate such amounts as may be necessary in the commissioner's discretion, and in accordance with section 3 of P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.3), to fund rental assistance grants under the program created pursuant to P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.1 et al.).  Such rental assistance grants shall be deemed necessary and authorized pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), in order to meet the housing needs of certain low income households who may not be eligible to occupy other housing produced pursuant to P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.). h.    The department and the State Treasurer shall submit the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" for an audit annually by the State Auditor or State Comptroller, at the discretion of the Treasurer.  In addition, the department shall prepare an annual report for each fiscal year, and submit it by November 30th of each year to the Governor and the Legislature, and the Joint Committee on Housing Affordability, or its successor, and post the information to its web site, of all activity of the fund, including details of the grants and loans by number of units, number and income ranges of recipients of grants or loans, location of the housing renovated or constructed using monies from the fund, the number of units upon which affordability controls were placed, and the length of those controls.  The report also shall include details pertaining to those monies allocated from the fund for use by the State rental assistance program pursuant to section 3 of P.L.2004, c.140 (C.52:27D-287.3) and subsection g. of this section. i.     The commissioner may award or grant the amount of any appropriation deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" pursuant to section 41 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-320.1) to municipalities pursuant to the provisions of section 39 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.40:55D-8.8). (cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.200) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize owners of property zoned for single-family or two-family residential use to develop an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on their property consistent with Statewide standards for the development of ADUs.  The bill would permit each municipality to adopt or amend its land use regulations to be consistent with the bills Statewide standards. Under the bill, a municipality may authorize a person to develop one or more ADUs on a lot owned by the person and located within a zone in which a single- or two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations.  While allowing a municipality to impose some exceptions in adopting its land use regulations regarding the development of ADUs, the bill would require municipal land use regulations to provide that an ADU is a permitted use as of right on a lot if a primary dwelling exists or is being proposed on the lot, and the lot is located within a zone in which a single-family dwelling or a two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations. The bill defines ADU as a residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, and is either: located within a proposed or existing primary dwelling; located within a proposed or existing accessory structure; constructed in whole or part as an extension to a proposed or existing primary dwelling; or constructed as a separate detached structure on the same lot as the existing or proposed primary dwelling. The bill would require a municipalitys land use regulations to provide that: · an ADU may be either located within or attached to the proposed or existing primary dwelling or to a proposed or existing garage or other accessory structure, or detached from the proposed or existing primary dwelling but located on the same lot as the proposed or existing primary dwelling.  A municipality would be prohibited from requiring installation of a passageway between a primary dwelling and a detached accessory structure; · an ADU may be rented separately from the primary dwelling, but is prohibited from being sold or otherwise conveyed separately from the primary dwelling; and · a municipality is prohibited from requiring an applicant to seek approval to develop an ADU, either simultaneously with or separately from the development of a primary dwelling. The bill would require municipal land use regulations concerning ADUs to comply with the following standards: · a minimum floor area requirement of no greater than 300 square feet; · a maximum floor area requirement of no smaller than 1,200 square feet; · a maximum height requirement of no less than 20 feet; · no requirement to install fire sprinklers in an ADU if there is no requirement to install fire sprinklers in the primary dwelling; · no setback requirements for an ADU that is located within an existing structure or a structure constructed in the same location and to the same dimensions as an existing structure being converted to an ADU; · no more than a five-foot sideyard and rearyard setback requirement for any other ADU; · an ADU must provide direct exterior access separate from the direct exterior access from the primary dwelling; · no parking requirement for an ADU in excess of one parking space per ADU, which may be provided as tandem parking; and · no requirement to replace an offstreet parking space being removed in conjunction with the construction of, or conversion to, an ADU. If a municipalitys land use regulations do not comply with the above requirements, the regulations would be void and unenforceable. The bill sets forth the following specific circumstances under which a municipal agency may deny an application to develop an ADU: · the proposed site is located within an area in which there exists insufficient public sewer or water service, and within which there exists severe constraints on the use of wells and septic tanks, which render the addition of a dwelling unit hazardous to the public health; or · the proposed site is located on a lot so small that an 800 square foot structure cannot be reasonably accommodated without violating the bills minimum sideyard or rearyard setback requirements. The bill would allow a municipalitys land use regulations to: · establish reasonable landscaping standards for detached ADUs; ·      impose architectural review requirements for an application proposing to develop an ADU within an area designated as a historic district, if the proposed development requires either new construction or exterior modification of an existing structure; ·      reduce or eliminate off-street parking requirements imposed upon the development of an ADU otherwise applicable under municipal land use regulation or Statewide site improvement standards; ·      provide that a municipal agency shall not approve an application to develop an ADU on a parcel of property unless the applicant is the owner-occupant of an existing or proposed primary dwelling on the property; ·      provide that an ADU is prohibited from being rented for a period of less than 30 days; ·      provide that an ADU is a permitted use in additional zoning districts; and · limit the maximum size of an ADU constructed separately from the primary dwelling to that square footage that is not in excess of 60 percent of the lots buildable area, as defined in the bill. The bill provides that an application to develop an ADU is to be considered and approved ministerially, without public hearing, and without review beyond that necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of the bill or municipal land use regulations adopted consistent with the bill.  The bill would allow a municipal agency to charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with reviewing and approving an application to develop an accessory dwelling unit. The bill requires a municipal agency to provide an applicant with its decision on an application to develop an ADU within 60 days of the date the applicant submits a complete application.  Unless the applicant agrees to toll this 60-day time period, if the municipal agency does not act upon the application within the 60-day time period, the application is to be deemed approved. If an application to develop an ADU is submitted together with an application to develop a new single-family dwelling on the same lot, upon the applicants request, the appropriate municipal agency is to consider and act upon both applications as a single application. The bill would prohibit a municipal agency from imposing conditions, beyond those necessary to comply with the provisions of the bill, upon the approval of an application to develop an ADU, if the application is submitted together with an application to develop a new single-family dwelling on the same lot. Additionally, the bill would prohibit a municipality from: · interpreting and applying a provision of any other municipal ordinance, policy, or regulation so to delay or deny approval of an application to develop an ADU. · conditioning approval of an application to develop an ADU upon the correction of a nonconforming zoning condition. · requiring, for an application to develop an ADU within an existing primary dwelling or as an extension onto an existing primary dwelling, the installation of a new or separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility, or imposition of a related connection fee or capacity charge, unless the ADU is being constructed together with a new single-family dwelling. If an application is submitted to develop an ADU as a separate structure, not part of an existing primary dwelling, a municipal agency may require the applicant to install a new or separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility, subject to a connection fee or capacity charge of no more than half the fee charged for a new primary dwelling, which fee shall not exceed the reasonable cost of providing this service. The bill would not supersede provisions of the State Uniform Construction Code applicable to the construction of ADUs, however, the bill specifies that the provisions of the Rehabilitation Subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code is to apply to the construction of an ADU within an existing primary dwelling.  Additionally, the bill would prohibit issuance of a certificate of occupancy for an ADU under the State Uniform Construction Code prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the primary dwelling. The bill would require a municipality to submit land use regulations it adopts concerning ADUs to the Department of Community Affairs within 60 days of the date of adoption of the municipal land use regulations.  The department would review the municipal land use regulations concerning ADUs and notify the municipality within 60 days of the date the department receives a municipalitys regulations of any provision in the regulations that does not comply with the bills provisions.  Under the bill, if the department does not notify a municipality, within 60 days of the date the department receives a municipalitys land use regulations concerning ADUs, that a provision of the municipal land use regulations does not comply with the bills provisions, the regulations are to be deemed approved. Within 90 days of the date a municipality receives notice of the departments determination that a provision of the municipalitys land use regulations does not comply with the provisions of this bill, the municipality shall either: amend its regulations to conform them with the provisions and intent of the bill; or respond to the department by: asking it to approve the municipal regulations, and explaining the municipalitys reasons why its regulations do not comply with the provisions and intent of this bill. In the case of the latter, the department would review the municipalitys response, consider the specific conditions affecting that municipality, as well as the intent of this bill, and notify the municipality either: that the municipality may retain all or some part of its land use regulations; or that the municipality is required to amend provisions of its land use regulations to be consistent with the provisions and intent of the bill. Within 60 days of the date of receipt of the departments notice requiring it to amend its land use regulations to be consistent with the provisions and intent of the bill, the municipality is required to amend its regulations. If a municipality does not approve an application to develop an ADU, or imposes conditions on an approval of an application to develop an ADU, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Commissioner of Community Affairs.  If the commissioner determines that the municipalitys reasons for withholding approval or imposing conditions are inconsistent with the bills provisions, the commissioner is required to approve the application, and levy the cost of the proceedings, including the applicants legal expenses, if any, against the municipality. The bill also amends the law governing associations formed for the management of common elements and facilities of a planned real  estate development to prohibit the adoption or enforcement of a restriction, covenant, bylaw, rule, regulation, master deed provision, or governing document provision that prohibits or unreasonably restricts the development or use of an ADU on a lot zoned for single-family residential use if the proposed ADU is consistent with the bills requirements.  Under the bill, any provisions of a planned real  estate developments governing documents that either prohibit or unreasonably restrict the development or use of an ADU on a lot zoned for single-family or two-family residential use is void and unenforceable if the proposed ADU is consistent with the requirements of the bill.  However, the bill specifically authorizes an association to impose design or landscaping conditions on the development of an ADU if the conditions: are not in excess of conditions generally imposed within the planned real estate development; do not unreasonably increase the cost to construct, effectively prohibit the construction of, or extinguish the ability to otherwise construct, an ADU consistent with the provisions of the bill. The bill would also amend the "Fair Housing Act," N.J.S.A.52:27D-301 et al., to require a municipality's master plan housing element to include a plan to promote the creation of ADUs that will be offered at affordable rent for low- and moderate-income households, and to clarify that amounts deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" may be applied for the purpose of creating ADUs to be occupied by low- and moderate-income households.

An Act concerning accessory dwelling units, supplementing P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) and P.L.1993, c.30 (C.45:22A-43 et seq.), and amending P.L.1985, c.222. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  a.  The Legislature finds and declares that: (1)   Accessory dwelling units are a valuable form of housing and present a way to expand the States housing supply that is both cost-effective and consistent with sound planning and environmental principles. (2)   Accessory dwelling units provide housing for family members, the elderly, in-home health care providers, individuals with disabilities, households of low and moderate income, and others, often at below-market prices within existing neighborhoods. (3)   Homeowners who develop accessory dwelling units can benefit from added income and an increased sense of security. (4)   Allowing accessory dwelling units in single-family and two-family residential zones will make it possible to expand the state of New Jerseys rental housing stock, and meet current and future housing demand. (5)   Accessory dwelling units offer lower-cost housing within existing neighborhoods while maintaining the architectural character of a neighborhood. (6)   Accessory dwelling units should therefore be considered an essential component of New Jerseys housing supply. b.    It is the intent of the Legislature that municipal land use regulations shall provide for the creation of accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and that no provision of any such regulation shall restrict the ability of a property owner to develop accessory dwelling units consistent with the provisions of P.L. , c.      (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 2.    (New section)  As used in sections 1 through 7 of P.L.    , c.    (C.      through C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Accessory dwelling unit means a residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, including provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation, and is located within a proposed or existing primary dwelling, within an existing or proposed accessory structure, constructed in whole or part as an extension to a proposed or existing primary dwelling, or constructed as a separate detached structure on the same lot as the existing or proposed primary dwelling. Accessory structure means a structure that is accessory and incidental to a dwelling located on the same lot. Buildable area means that area within the rear yard of a lot on which a primary dwelling is located that is beyond a five-foot setback line from the side and rear property lines. Commissioner means the Commissioner of Community Affairs. Department means the Department of Community Affairs. Primary dwelling means a single-family or two-family dwelling proposed or existing on a residential lot. Single-family dwelling means any structure that contains a single-family dwelling unit on an individual lot, including structures that are attached to other single-family dwellings with a common party wall commonly known as semi-detached houses, row houses or townhouses. Tandem parking means parking two or more automobiles on a driveway or another location on a lot, aligned so that one automobile is parked immediately behind the another. Two-family dwelling means any structure that contains two separate dwelling units on an individual lot, whether separated horizontally or vertically. 3.    (New section)  a.  A municipality may adopt or amend existing land use regulations to authorize a person to develop one or more accessory dwelling units on a lot owned by the person, and located within an area meeting the requirements of subsection c. of this section, in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures set forth in P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). b.    A provision of a municipal land use regulation that is in place on the effective date of P.L. , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) but fails to comply with the requirements of P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be null, void, and unenforceable.  A municipality shall follow the requirements of P.L.   , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) when considering an application to develop an accessory dwelling unit, unless and until the municipality adopts or amends its land use regulations in a manner consistent with the standards and procedures set forth in P.L.      , c.      (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     Except as otherwise provided in section 5 of P.L.  , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), land use regulations adopted or amended pursuant to P.L.    c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall provide that an accessory dwelling unit is a permitted use as of right on a lot if a primary dwelling exists or is being proposed on the lot, and the lot is located within a zone in which a single-family dwelling or a two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations.  An accessory dwelling unit shall be deemed to not exceed the allowable density for the lot upon which the accessory dwelling unit is proposed to be located or deemed to be the expansion of a prior nonconforming use. d.    The land use regulations shall also provide that: (1)  An accessory dwelling unit may be either located within or attached to the proposed or existing primary dwelling or to a proposed or existing garage or other accessory structure, or detached from the proposed or existing primary dwelling but located on the same lot as the proposed or existing primary dwelling.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.199) 10.  Section 11 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-311) is amended to read as follows: 11.  a.  In adopting its housing element, the municipality may provide for its fair share of low and moderate income housing by means of any technique or combination of techniques which provide a realistic opportunity for the provision of the fair share.  The housing element shall contain an analysis demonstrating that it will provide such a realistic opportunity, and the municipality shall establish that its land use and other relevant ordinances have been revised to incorporate the provisions for low and moderate income housing.  In preparing the housing element, the municipality shall consider the following techniques for providing low and moderate income housing within the municipality, as well as such other techniques as may be published by the council or proposed by the municipality: (1)   Rezoning for densities necessary to assure the economic viability of any inclusionary developments, either through mandatory set-asides or density bonuses, as may be necessary to meet all or part of the municipality's fair share in accordance with the regulations of the council and the provisions of subsection h. of this section;

(cf: P.L.2013, c.6, s.1) 11.  Section 20 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-320) is amended to read as follows: 20.  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a separate trust fund, to be used for the exclusive purposes as provided in this section, and which shall be known as the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund."  The fund shall be a non-lapsing, revolving trust fund, and all monies deposited or received for purposes of the fund shall be accounted for separately, by source and amount, and remain in the fund until appropriated for such purposes.  The fund shall be the repository of all State funds appropriated for affordable housing purposes, including, but not limited to, the proceeds from the receipts of the additional fee collected pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 3 of P.L.1968, c.49 (C.46:15-7), proceeds from available receipts of the Statewide non-residential development fees collected pursuant to section 35 of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.4), monies lapsing or reverting from municipal development trust funds, or other monies as may be dedicated, earmarked, or appropriated by the Legislature for the purposes of the fund.  All references in any law, order, rule, regulation, contract, loan, document, or otherwise, to the "Neighborhood Preservation Nonlapsing Revolving Fund" shall mean the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund."  The department shall be permitted to utilize annually up to 7.5 percent of the monies available in the fund for the payment of any necessary administrative costs related to the administration of the "Fair Housing Act," P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et al.), or any costs related to administration of P.L.2008, c.46 (C.52:27D-329.1 et al.). a.     Except as permitted pursuant to subsection g. of this section, and by section 41 of P.L.2009, c.90 (C.52:27D-320.1), the commissioner shall award grants or loans from this fund for housing projects and programs in municipalities whose housing elements have received substantive certification from the council, in municipalities receiving State aid pursuant to P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52:27D-178 et seq.), in municipalities subject to a builder's remedy as defined in section 28 of P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-328), or in receiving municipalities in cases where the council has approved a regional contribution agreement and a project plan developed by the receiving municipality. Of those monies deposited into the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" that are derived from municipal development fee trust funds, or from available collections of Statewide non-residential development fees, a priority for funding shall be established for projects in municipalities that have petitioned the council for substantive certification. Programs and projects in any municipality shall be funded only after receipt by the commissioner of a written statement in support of the program or project from the municipal governing body. b.    The commissioner shall establish rules and regulations governing the qualifications of applicants, the application procedures, and the criteria for awarding grants and loans and the standards for establishing the amount, terms, and conditions of each grant or loan. c.     For any period which the council may approve, the commissioner may assist affordable housing programs which are not located in municipalities whose housing elements have been granted substantive certification or which are not in furtherance of a regional contribution agreement; provided that the affordable housing program will meet all or part of a municipal low and moderate income housing obligation. d.    Amounts deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" shall be targeted to regions based on the region's percentage of the State's low and moderate income housing need as determined by the council.  Amounts in the fund shall be applied for the following purposes in designated neighborhoods: (1)   Rehabilitation of substandard housing units occupied or to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (2)   Creation of accessory [apartments] dwelling units to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (3)   Conversion of non-residential space to residential purposes; provided a substantial percentage of the resulting housing units are to be occupied by low and moderate income households; (4)   Acquisition of real property, demolition and removal of buildings, or construction of new housing that will be occupied by low and moderate income households, or any combination thereof; (5)   Grants of assistance to eligible municipalities for costs of necessary studies, surveys, plans, and permits; engineering, architectural, and other technical services; costs of land acquisition and any buildings thereon; and costs of site preparation, demolition, and infrastructure development for projects undertaken pursuant to an approved regional contribution agreement; (6)   Assistance to a local housing authority, nonprofit or limited dividend housing corporation, or association or a qualified entity acting as a receiver under P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-114 et al.) for rehabilitation or restoration of housing units which it administers which: (a) are unusable or in a serious state of disrepair; (b) can be restored in an economically feasible and sound manner; and (c) can be retained in a safe, decent, and sanitary manner, upon completion of rehabilitation or restoration; and (7)   Other housing programs for low and moderate income housing, including, without limitation, (a) infrastructure projects directly facilitating the construction of low and moderate income housing not to exceed a reasonable percentage of the construction costs of the low and moderate income housing to be provided and (b) alteration of dwelling units occupied or to be occupied by households of low or moderate income and the common areas of the premises in which they are located in order to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. e.     Any grant or loan agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall incorporate contractual guarantees and procedures by which the division will ensure that any unit of housing provided for low and moderate income households shall continue to be occupied by low and moderate income households for at least 20 years following the award of the loan or grant, except that the division may approve a guarantee for a period of less than 20 years where necessary to ensure project feasibility. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, in making grants or loans under this section, the department shall not require that tenants be certified as low or moderate income or that contractual guarantees or deed restrictions be in place to ensure continued low and moderate income occupancy as a condition of providing housing assistance from any program administered by the department, when that assistance is provided for a project of moderate rehabilitation if the project: (1) contains 30 or fewer rental units; and (2) is located in a census tract in which the median household income is 60 percent or less of the median income for the housing region in which the census tract is located, as determined for a three person household by the council in accordance with the latest federal decennial census.

(cf: P.L.2017, c.131, s.200) 12.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize owners of property zoned for single-family or two-family residential use to develop an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) on their property consistent with Statewide standards for the development of ADUs.  The bill would permit each municipality to adopt or amend its land use regulations to be consistent with the bills Statewide standards. Under the bill, a municipality may authorize a person to develop one or more ADUs on a lot owned by the person and located within a zone in which a single- or two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations.  While allowing a municipality to impose some exceptions in adopting its land use regulations regarding the development of ADUs, the bill would require municipal land use regulations to provide that an ADU is a permitted use as of right on a lot if a primary dwelling exists or is being proposed on the lot, and the lot is located within a zone in which a single-family dwelling or a two-family dwelling is permitted under the municipal land use regulations. The bill defines ADU as a residential dwelling unit that provides complete independent living facilities for one or more persons, and is either: located within a proposed or existing primary dwelling; located within a proposed or existing accessory structure; constructed in whole or part as an extension to a proposed or existing primary dwelling; or constructed as a separate detached structure on the same lot as the existing or proposed primary dwelling. The bill would require a municipalitys land use regulations to provide that: · an ADU may be either located within or attached to the proposed or existing primary dwelling or to a proposed or existing garage or other accessory structure, or detached from the proposed or existing primary dwelling but located on the same lot as the proposed or existing primary dwelling.  A municipality would be prohibited from requiring installation of a passageway between a primary dwelling and a detached accessory structure; · an ADU may be rented separately from the primary dwelling, but is prohibited from being sold or otherwise conveyed separately from the primary dwelling; and · a municipality is prohibited from requiring an applicant to seek approval to develop an ADU, either simultaneously with or separately from the development of a primary dwelling. The bill would require municipal land use regulations concerning ADUs to comply with the following standards: · a minimum floor area requirement of no greater than 300 square feet; · a maximum floor area requirement of no smaller than 1,200 square feet; · a maximum height requirement of no less than 20 feet; · no requirement to install fire sprinklers in an ADU if there is no requirement to install fire sprinklers in the primary dwelling; · no setback requirements for an ADU that is located within an existing structure or a structure constructed in the same location and to the same dimensions as an existing structure being converted to an ADU; · no more than a five-foot sideyard and rearyard setback requirement for any other ADU; · an ADU must provide direct exterior access separate from the direct exterior access from the primary dwelling; · no parking requirement for an ADU in excess of one parking space per ADU, which may be provided as tandem parking; and · no requirement to replace an offstreet parking space being removed in conjunction with the construction of, or conversion to, an ADU. If a municipalitys land use regulations do not comply with the above requirements, the regulations would be void and unenforceable. The bill sets forth the following specific circumstances under which a municipal agency may deny an application to develop an ADU: · the proposed site is located within an area in which there exists insufficient public sewer or water service, and within which there exists severe constraints on the use of wells and septic tanks, which render the addition of a dwelling unit hazardous to the public health; or · the proposed site is located on a lot so small that an 800 square foot structure cannot be reasonably accommodated without violating the bills minimum sideyard or rearyard setback requirements. The bill would allow a municipalitys land use regulations to: · establish reasonable landscaping standards for detached ADUs; ·      impose architectural review requirements for an application proposing to develop an ADU within an area designated as a historic district, if the proposed development requires either new construction or exterior modification of an existing structure; ·      reduce or eliminate off-street parking requirements imposed upon the development of an ADU otherwise applicable under municipal land use regulation or Statewide site improvement standards; ·      provide that a municipal agency shall not approve an application to develop an ADU on a parcel of property unless the applicant is the owner-occupant of an existing or proposed primary dwelling on the property; ·      provide that an ADU is prohibited from being rented for a period of less than 30 days; ·      provide that an ADU is a permitted use in additional zoning districts; and · limit the maximum size of an ADU constructed separately from the primary dwelling to that square footage that is not in excess of 60 percent of the lots buildable area, as defined in the bill. The bill provides that an application to develop an ADU is to be considered and approved ministerially, without public hearing, and without review beyond that necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of the bill or municipal land use regulations adopted consistent with the bill.  The bill would allow a municipal agency to charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs associated with reviewing and approving an application to develop an accessory dwelling unit. The bill requires a municipal agency to provide an applicant with its decision on an application to develop an ADU within 60 days of the date the applicant submits a complete application.  Unless the applicant agrees to toll this 60-day time period, if the municipal agency does not act upon the application within the 60-day time period, the application is to be deemed approved. If an application to develop an ADU is submitted together with an application to develop a new single-family dwelling on the same lot, upon the applicants request, the appropriate municipal agency is to consider and act upon both applications as a single application. The bill would prohibit a municipal agency from imposing conditions, beyond those necessary to comply with the provisions of the bill, upon the approval of an application to develop an ADU, if the application is submitted together with an application to develop a new single-family dwelling on the same lot. Additionally, the bill would prohibit a municipality from: · interpreting and applying a provision of any other municipal ordinance, policy, or regulation so to delay or deny approval of an application to develop an ADU. · conditioning approval of an application to develop an ADU upon the correction of a nonconforming zoning condition. · requiring, for an application to develop an ADU within an existing primary dwelling or as an extension onto an existing primary dwelling, the installation of a new or separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility, or imposition of a related connection fee or capacity charge, unless the ADU is being constructed together with a new single-family dwelling. If an application is submitted to develop an ADU as a separate structure, not part of an existing primary dwelling, a municipal agency may require the applicant to install a new or separate utility connection directly between the ADU and the utility, subject to a connection fee or capacity charge of no more than half the fee charged for a new primary dwelling, which fee shall not exceed the reasonable cost of providing this service. The bill would not supersede provisions of the State Uniform Construction Code applicable to the construction of ADUs, however, the bill specifies that the provisions of the Rehabilitation Subcode of the State Uniform Construction Code is to apply to the construction of an ADU within an existing primary dwelling.  Additionally, the bill would prohibit issuance of a certificate of occupancy for an ADU under the State Uniform Construction Code prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the primary dwelling. The bill would require a municipality to submit land use regulations it adopts concerning ADUs to the Department of Community Affairs within 60 days of the date of adoption of the municipal land use regulations.  The department would review the municipal land use regulations concerning ADUs and notify the municipality within 60 days of the date the department receives a municipalitys regulations of any provision in the regulations that does not comply with the bills provisions.  Under the bill, if the department does not notify a municipality, within 60 days of the date the department receives a municipalitys land use regulations concerning ADUs, that a provision of the municipal land use regulations does not comply with the bills provisions, the regulations are to be deemed approved. Within 90 days of the date a municipality receives notice of the departments determination that a provision of the municipalitys land use regulations does not comply with the provisions of this bill, the municipality shall either: amend its regulations to conform them with the provisions and intent of the bill; or respond to the department by: asking it to approve the municipal regulations, and explaining the municipalitys reasons why its regulations do not comply with the provisions and intent of this bill. In the case of the latter, the department would review the municipalitys response, consider the specific conditions affecting that municipality, as well as the intent of this bill, and notify the municipality either: that the municipality may retain all or some part of its land use regulations; or that the municipality is required to amend provisions of its land use regulations to be consistent with the provisions and intent of the bill. Within 60 days of the date of receipt of the departments notice requiring it to amend its land use regulations to be consistent with the provisions and intent of the bill, the municipality is required to amend its regulations. If a municipality does not approve an application to develop an ADU, or imposes conditions on an approval of an application to develop an ADU, the applicant may appeal the decision to the Commissioner of Community Affairs.  If the commissioner determines that the municipalitys reasons for withholding approval or imposing conditions are inconsistent with the bills provisions, the commissioner is required to approve the application, and levy the cost of the proceedings, including the applicants legal expenses, if any, against the municipality. The bill also amends the law governing associations formed for the management of common elements and facilities of a planned real  estate development to prohibit the adoption or enforcement of a restriction, covenant, bylaw, rule, regulation, master deed provision, or governing document provision that prohibits or unreasonably restricts the development or use of an ADU on a lot zoned for single-family residential use if the proposed ADU is consistent with the bills requirements.  Under the bill, any provisions of a planned real  estate developments governing documents that either prohibit or unreasonably restrict the development or use of an ADU on a lot zoned for single-family or two-family residential use is void and unenforceable if the proposed ADU is consistent with the requirements of the bill.  However, the bill specifically authorizes an association to impose design or landscaping conditions on the development of an ADU if the conditions: are not in excess of conditions generally imposed within the planned real estate development; do not unreasonably increase the cost to construct, effectively prohibit the construction of, or extinguish the ability to otherwise construct, an ADU consistent with the provisions of the bill. The bill would also amend the "Fair Housing Act," N.J.S.A.52:27D-301 et al., to require a municipality's master plan housing element to include a plan to promote the creation of ADUs that will be offered at affordable rent for low- and moderate-income households, and to clarify that amounts deposited in the "New Jersey Affordable Housing Trust Fund" may be applied for the purpose of creating ADUs to be occupied by low- and moderate-income households.
