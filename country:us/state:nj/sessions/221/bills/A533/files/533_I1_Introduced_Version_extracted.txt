(cf: P.L.2016, c.68, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill authorizes all classes of special law enforcement officers (SLEOs) and members of the volunteer auxiliary police to carry firearms in the performance of their duties. Current law establishes three classes of SLEOs. Class One SLEOs specifically are prohibited from carrying a firearm or being assigned duties requiring a firearm. Class Two SLEOs may carry firearms in the performance of duties, if they complete firearm training as prescribed by the police training commission and are authorized to carry by a municipality. Class Three SLEOs are retired full-time law enforcement officers who are permitted to carry a firearm in the performance of their duties and do not require additional firearm training. This bill removes the prohibition on carrying a firearm for Class One SLEOs and municipal discretion to choose to authorize Class Two SLEOs to carry. Under the bill, both classes of SLEOs would be permitted carry in the performance of their duties after completion of firearm training. Additionally, this bill requires municipalities to permit members of the volunteer auxiliary police to carry in the performance of their duties after completion of the firearm training required for SLEOs. Volunteer auxiliary police officers are volunteers who are trained to assist law enforcement officers and perform certain functions, such as crowd and traffic control or uniformed foot patrol.
