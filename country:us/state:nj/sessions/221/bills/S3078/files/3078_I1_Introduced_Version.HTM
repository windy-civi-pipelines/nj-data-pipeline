<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the Offshore
Wind Economic Development Act to provide that the Board of Public Utilities
(BPU) may not require ratepayers to pay or prepay any costs associated with the
subsidies for qualified offshore wind projects approved by the BPU.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the BPU
administers an offshore wind renewable energy certificate (OREC) program that
permits qualified offshore wind projects to sell ORECs to electric power
suppliers and basic generation service providers at a price and for a time
period determined by order of the BPU.  An OREC is a portion of the mechanism in
which subsidies are provided for offshore wind projects by allowing eligible
projects to be credited with saleable ORECs for each megawatt-hour generated by
the project and delivered to the transmission grid.  However, pursuant to
regulations adopted by the BPU, the State currently requires electric public
utilities to impose an OREC surcharge on ratepayers to pre-collect the costs of
the project subsidy.  Ratepayers are later refunded based on the revenue
generated from the sale of ORECs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits the BPU
from requiring ratepayers to make any payments or prepayments for any part of
the subsidy for a qualified offshore wind project, including, but not limited
to, an OREC surcharge or any other similar fee or rate intended to recover the
costs of the subsidy.</p>
