Jersey Disclosure and Accountability Transparency Act (NJ DaTA), establishes
certain rights for consumers concerning the disclosure and processing of a
consumers personally identifiable information. A controller, as that term is
defined in the bill, that collects the personally identifiable information of a
consumer may lawfully process the personally identifiable information pursuant
certain provisions in the bill only if at least one of the following applies:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1)    the consumer has given
consent to the processing of the personally identifiable information for at
least one specific purpose provided by the controller;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2)    processing is necessary
for the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party or in order
to take steps at the request of the consumer prior to entering into a contract;</p>

for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;</p>

to protect the vital interest of the consumer or another person;</p>

for the performance of a task conducted in the public interest or in the
exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6)    processing is necessary
for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a
third party, except where those interests are overridden by the interests or
fundamental rights and freedoms of the consumer, which require protection of
personally identifiable information, including that of a child.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
controller that collects the personally identifiable information of a consumer
is to, at the time when personally identifiable information is collected,
provide to a consumer information concerning the processing of that personally
identifiable information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily
accessible form, using clear and plain language, in writing, or by other means,
including, where appropriate, by electronic means that shall include, but not
be limited to, certain information listed in the bill. The bill further
provides that where the controller intends to process a consumers personally
identifiable information for a purpose other than that for which the personally
identifiable information was collected, the controller is to provide certain
disclosures to the consumer prior to that processing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The processing of personally
identifiable information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinion,

be prohibited except in certain circumstances provided in the bill.</p>

certain circumstances provided by the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that where
processing has been restricted, personally identifiable information, with the

interest.</p>

controller is to notify each processor and third party that received a
consumers personally identifiable information of any rectification or erasure
of personally identifiable information made by a consumer pursuant to the bill
or restriction of processing made by a consumer pursuant to the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
consumer is to have the right to object, by any means, to the processing of
personally identifiable information, at which time the controller is to no
longer process the personally identifiable information unless the controller
demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides
the interests, rights, and freedoms of the consumer or for the establishment,
exercise, or defense of legal claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Where personally identifiable
information is processed for direct marketing purposes, including profiling,
the consumer is to have the right to object at any time to processing of
personally identifiable information for this purpose, at which time the
personally identifiable information is to no longer be used for this purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that where
personally identifiable information is processed for scientific or historical
research purposes or statistical purposes, the consumer is to have the right to
object, by any means, to the processing of their personally identifiable
information unless the processing is necessary for the public interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
consumer is not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision
making, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning the
consumer or similarly significantly affects the consumer except under certain
circumstances provided in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
controller is to implement the appropriate technical and organizational
measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate to the office that processing
is performed in accordance with the requirements of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a controller
and processor, in certain situations provided in the bill, to designate in
writing to the office a representative that is to serve as a liaison between
the controller or processor and the office and public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, where
processing is to be conducted on behalf of a controller by a processor, the
controller is to contract with a processor providing sufficient guarantees to
implement appropriate technical and organization measures in a manner that
processing shall meet the requirements the bill. The processor shall not engage
another processor without prior specific or general written authorization of
the controller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Processing by a processor is
to be governed by a contract between a processor and controller that is to
include certain provisions provided in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill allows the office to
adopt standard contractual clauses for the contracts between controllers and
processors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
controller and, where applicable, the controllers representative, is to
maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. A
processor and, where applicable, the processors representative, is to maintain
a record of all categories of processing activities carried out on behalf of a
controller. These records are to be in writing, including in electronic form,
and be made available to the office upon request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Taking into account the
technology, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, and
purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity
for the rights and freedoms of a person, the bill requires a controller and
processor to implement appropriate technical and organization measures to
ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including certain measures
provided in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In assessing the appropriate
level of security, account is to be taken concerning the risks that are
presented by processing, such as from unlawful destruction, loss, alteration,
unauthorized disclosure of, or access to personally identifiable information
transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Adherence to a code of conduct
or certification mechanism approved by the office may be used as an element by
which to demonstrate compliance with the requirements established pursuant to
the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that,
notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, in the
event of a data breach resulting in the unauthorized access of personally
identifiable information, the controller is to immediately and, where feasible,
