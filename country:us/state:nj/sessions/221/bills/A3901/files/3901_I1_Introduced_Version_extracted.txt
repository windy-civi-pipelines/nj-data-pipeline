CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning traffic control devices and amending P.L.2000, c.73. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 3 of P.L.2000, c.73 (C.27:1B-21.16) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  The Commissioner of Transportation (hereinafter, "the commissioner") shall establish and implement a program to employ adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, at all intersections of roads and highways that are maintained by the Department of Transportation and meet the traffic threshold established by the Department of Transportation pursuant to subsection b. of this section, to improve traffic signal operation throughout the State so as to avoid unnecessary delays, reduce air pollution, and allow traffic to move sequentially through signals on roads and highways throughout the State without stopping, to the greatest extent practicable and financially feasible without endangering or limiting pedestrian travel. b.  In establishing and implementing the program pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the Department of Transportation shall develop a traffic threshold for intersections of roads and highways, based on the volume and speed of through traffic, which, when met, would signify that the intersection qualifies for the employment of adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, pursuant to the program established in subsection a. of this section. c.  Once an intersection meets the traffic threshold developed by the Department of Transportation pursuant to subsection b. of this section, adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, shall be installed at the intersection during inspection, servicing, or replacement of the traffic signals. (cf: P.L.2000, c.73, s.3) 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill amends the Congestion Relief and Transportation Trust Fund Renewal Act to require the Commissioner of Transportation (commissioner) to establish and implement a program to employ adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, at certain intersections of roads and highways that are maintained by the Department of Transportation (department) and meet the traffic threshold established by the department pursuant to the bill. The bill requires the department to develop a traffic threshold for intersections of roads and highways based on the volume and speed of through traffic.  Meeting the traffic threshold would signify that the intersection qualifies for the employment of adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, under the program.  Once an intersection meets the traffic threshold, adaptive traffic signal technology, or the best available traffic signal technology, would be required to be installed at the intersection during inspection, servicing, or replacement of the traffic signals. The bill also requires that the commissioner consider practicality, financial feasibility, and the danger or limits on pedestrian travel when employing the technology at intersections.
