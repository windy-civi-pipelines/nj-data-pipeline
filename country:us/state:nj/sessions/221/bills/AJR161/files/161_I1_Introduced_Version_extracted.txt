August 17th of each year is permanently designated as Nonprofit Day in New Jersey to recognize the efforts of nonprofit organizations and their effort to serve local communities. 2. The Governor shall annually issue a proclamation and call upon public officials and all citizens of this State to observe Nonprofit Day with appropriate programs and activities. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates August 17 of every year as Nonprofit Day in New Jersey with the goal of recognizing the over 40,000 nonprofit organizations operating in the State. Nonprofits are organizations that serve different purposes, such as raising awareness and providing a public service. These organizations are not run with the sole purpose of generating a profit which means they rely heavily on donations and volunteers for day-to-day operation. Nonprofit organizations play a crucial role in society by addressing many social and humanitarian issues that impact marginalized communities. To accomplish this, nonprofit organizations provide essential services, such as food assistance, healthcare and educational programming. Through partnerships with both private sector and governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations are able to promote a collective responsibility in every facet of the community. In New Jersey, there are roughly 1.8 million nonprofit volunteers contributing 225 million hours of service every year. In addition to volunteers, nonprofits employ 330,000 members of New Jerseys workforce accounting for 10 percent of private sector workers. The value that nonprofit volunteers and their employees bring to the state New Jersey is valued at over $5.3 billion a year. Throughout the United States, August 17 is already recognized as Nonprofit Day in order to acknowledge the contributions these organizations provide to society. By designating August 17 as Nonprofit Day in New Jersey, the State of New Jersey will join a broader movement to honor the work of nonprofit volunteers and workers throughout the State.
