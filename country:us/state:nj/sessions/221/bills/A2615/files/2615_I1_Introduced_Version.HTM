Tax Relief Act.  Budget constraints required reductions in the amount of
Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid (CMPTRA) distributed to all
municipalities in Fiscal Years 2009, 2010, and 2011.  Some municipalities also
experienced reductions in their Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid (ETR
Aid) distribution during that period.  This supplemental funding would restore,
over a five-year period, approximately $331 million in reductions to CMPTRA and
 ETR Aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In Fiscal Year 2017,
municipalities would receive an aid increase equal to 20% of the difference
between their total payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid in Fiscal Year 2008 and
Fiscal Year 2012.  Municipalities would receive equal increases in each of the
following four fiscal years.  The fully restored amount would be distributed
beginning in State Fiscal Year 2021 and in each fiscal year thereafter.  The
total amount of aid to be restored to each municipality would be in addition to
the total amount of CMPTRA and ETR Aid distributed to each municipality in
Fiscal Year 2012.  This legislation also extends the existing ETR
Aid poison pill protection to ensure that each municipality received an aid
amount not less than the combined payment of CMPTRA and ETR Aid to
municipalities in Fiscal Year 2012 and the additional aid distributed under the
bill.</p>

law to require a municipality to subtract any additional amount of ETR
aid it receives, pursuant to the bill, from its adjusted tax levy when
computing that amount for its next fiscal year.  By deducting the additional
amount of ETR Aid from the previous years levy, municipalities would be
permitted to raise a lower amount of taxes through the levy for municipal purposes,
thereby benefitting property taxpayers.</p>
