STATEMENT This bill updates current law regulating occupational therapists.  Specifically, under the bill, there is established a requirement for the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs, in consultation with the Occupational Therapy Advisory Council, to develop continuing competence and professional development requirements in order for licensed occupational therapists and licensed occupational therapy assistants to renew licenses.  Additionally, the bill adds a definition of occupational therapy services and expands the types of issues in which occupational therapy may be sought.  The bill will also allow members of the council to serve a maximum of three consecutive sessions and for the council to meet at least four times annually.  Lastly, examinations required in current law will be administered by the National Board for Certification in Occupational Therapy and submission to the director of proof of fieldwork completion will no longer be required as a result of updated standardized requirements for licensure.
