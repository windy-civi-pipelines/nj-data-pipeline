STATEMENT This bill would allow a county or municipality to use monies in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds. These funds are often referred to as open space trust funds.  This bill would expand this authorization to allow counties and municipalities to use the monies in such funds for the additional purpose of remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under this bill, a county or municipality would not be required to obtain voter approval to use funds in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes; however, the county or municipality would be required to adopt a resolution or ordinance, as appropriate, prior to doing so, and comply with public notice requirements contained in the bill.

STATEMENT This bill would allow a county or municipality to use monies in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds. These funds are often referred to as open space trust funds.  This bill would expand this authorization to allow counties and municipalities to use the monies in such funds for the additional purpose of remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes on property owned by the county or municipality. Under this bill, a county or municipality would not be required to obtain voter approval to use funds in their open space trust fund for the remediation of collapsed mine shafts and sinkholes; however, the county or municipality would be required to adopt a resolution or ordinance, as appropriate, prior to doing so, and comply with public notice requirements contained in the bill.
