<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.1968,
c.385 (C.17:28-1.1) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Except for a basic
automobile insurance policy, no motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of
such policy of insurance, including a standard liability policy for an
automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), insuring
against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or
death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use
of a motor vehicle, shall be issued in this State with respect to any motor
vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State unless it includes
coverage in limits for bodily injury or death as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   an amount or limit of <b><span

exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one
person, in any one accident, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   an amount or limit,
subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of <b><span

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>$200,000</u>,
exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to or death of more than
one person, in any one accident, under provisions approved by the Commissioner
of Banking and Insurance, for payment of all or part of the sums which the
insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as
damages from the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle, or hit and
run motor vehicle, as defined in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78),
because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting
therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the
ownership, maintenance, operation or use of such uninsured or hit and run motor
vehicle anywhere within the United States or Canada; except that uninsured
motorist coverage shall provide that in order to recover for non-economic loss,
as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), for accidents to which
the benefits of section 4 (C.39:6A-4) of that act apply, the tort option
elected pursuant to section 8 (C.39:6A-8) of that act shall apply to that
injured person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All motor vehicle liability
policies, except basic automobile insurance policies, shall also include
coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured
thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or
operators of uninsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run motor vehicles,
because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of such insured,
with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any one accident of <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>$5,000.00<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>$35,000</u>,
and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such
damages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided as an option by an insurer to
the named insured electing a standard automobile insurance policy up to at
least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each
accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or
$500,000.00 single limit, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such
damage to property for each accident, except that the limits for uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle
liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Rates for uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be uniform
on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be
increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered
under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by
stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. 
If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one
policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of
the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the
applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the
limits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Uninsured and
underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions
and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance,
including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of
coverage, subrogation and arbitration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     For the purpose of this
section, (1) &quot;underinsured motorist coverage&quot; means insurance for
damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident
arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured
motor vehicle. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured
motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of
liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and
insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for

c.197 (C. 39:6B-1) and section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1). An

vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power, excepting such vehicles as
run only upon rails or tracks and motorized bicycles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Thus, under the bill, all
motor vehicles and private passenger automobile policies in the State, except
those insured under the basic or special policy, would be required to have
bodily injury liability coverage of at least $100,000 per person and $200,000
per accident, and $35,000 of liability coverage for property damage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends the law
concerning medical expense benefits options as part of the personal injury
protection, or PIP, coverage, per person, per accident, under standard
automobile policies.  Under the bill, the minimum amount of medical expense <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
benefits an insured may choose as an alternative to the standard amount of
medical expense benefits is increased from the current $15,000 to $25,000.  The

certain permanent or significant injuries remains intact.</p>
