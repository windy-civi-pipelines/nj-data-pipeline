SCUTARI District 22 (Somerset and Union) SYNOPSIS Increases certain minimum limits for motor vehicle and automobile insurance coverages. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning motor vehicle insurance and amending various parts of the statutory law. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  Except for a basic automobile insurance policy, no motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, including a standard liability policy for an automobile as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, shall be issued in this State with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State unless it includes coverage in limits for bodily injury or death as follows: (1)   an amount or limit of [$15,000.00] $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident, and (2)   an amount or limit, subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of [$30,000.00] $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to or death of more than one person, in any one accident, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, for payment of all or part of the sums which the insured or his legal representative shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the operator or owner of an uninsured motor vehicle, or hit and run motor vehicle, as defined in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78), because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom, sustained by the insured, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of such uninsured or hit and run motor vehicle anywhere within the United States or Canada; except that uninsured motorist coverage shall provide that in order to recover for non-economic loss, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), for accidents to which the benefits of section 4 (C.39:6A-4) of that act apply, the tort option elected pursuant to section 8 (C.39:6A-8) of that act shall apply to that injured person. All motor vehicle liability policies, except basic automobile insurance policies, shall also include coverage for the payment of all or part of the sums which persons insured thereunder shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles, other than hit and run motor vehicles, because of injury to or destruction to the personal property of such insured, with a limit in the aggregate for all insurers involved in any one accident of [$5,000.00] $35,000, and subject, for each insured, to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damages. b.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be provided as an option by an insurer to the named insured electing a standard automobile insurance policy up to at least the following limits: $250,000.00 each person and $500,000.00 each accident for bodily injury; $100,000.00 each accident for property damage or $500,000.00 single limit, subject to an exclusion of the first $500.00 of such damage to property for each accident, except that the limits for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall not exceed the insured's motor vehicle liability policy limits for bodily injury and property damage, respectively. Rates for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage for the same limits shall, for each filer, be uniform on a Statewide basis without regard to classification or territory. c.     Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage provided for in this section shall not be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple motor vehicles covered under the same policy of insurance nor shall these coverages be increased by stacking the limits of coverage of multiple policies available to the insured. If the insured had uninsured motorist coverage available under more than one policy, any recovery shall not exceed the higher of the applicable limits of the respective coverages and the recovery shall be prorated between the applicable coverages as the limits of each coverage bear to the total of the limits. d.    Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage shall be subject to the policy terms, conditions and exclusions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, including, but not limited to, unauthorized settlements, non-duplication of coverage, subrogation and arbitration. e.     For the purpose of this section, (1) "underinsured motorist coverage" means insurance for damages because of bodily injury and property damage resulting from an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an underinsured motor vehicle. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not apply to an uninsured motor vehicle.  A motor vehicle is underinsured when the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury and property damage liability bonds and insurance policies available to a person against whom recovery is sought for bodily injury or property damage is, at the time of the accident, less than the applicable limits for underinsured motorist coverage afforded under the motor vehicle insurance policy held by the person seeking that recovery.  A motor vehicle shall not be considered an underinsured motor vehicle under this section unless the limits of all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of settlements or judgments.  The limits of underinsured motorist coverage available to an injured person shall be reduced by the amount he has recovered under all bodily injury liability insurance or bonds; (2)   "uninsured motor vehicle" means: (a)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is no bodily injury liability insurance or bond applicable at the time of the accident; (b)   a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of which there is bodily injury liability insurance in existence but the liability insurer denies coverage or is unable to make payment with respect to the legal liability of its insured because the insurer has become insolvent or bankrupt, or the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance has undertaken control of the insurer for the purpose of liquidation; (c)   a hit and run motor vehicle as described in section 18 of P.L.1952, c.174 (C.39:6-78); or (d)   an automobile covered by a special automobile insurance policy pursuant to section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3). "Uninsured motor vehicle" shall not include an automobile covered by a basic automobile insurance policy; an underinsured motor vehicle; a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household; a self-insurer within the meaning of any financial responsibility or similar law of the state in which the motor vehicle is registered or principally garaged; a motor vehicle which is owned by the United States or Canada, or a state, political subdivision or agency of those governments or any of the foregoing; a land motor vehicle or trailer operated on rails or crawler treads; a motor vehicle used as a residence or stationary structure and not as a vehicle; or equipment or vehicles designed for use principally off public roads, except while actually upon public roads. f.     Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, a motor vehicle liability policy or renewal of such policy of insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death, sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, issued in this State to a corporate or business entity with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State, shall not provide less uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage for an individual employed by the corporate or business entity than the coverage provided to the named insured under the policy. A policy that names a corporate or business entity as a named insured shall be deemed to provide the maximum uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage available under the policy to an individual employed by the corporate or business entity, regardless of whether the individual is an additional named insured under that policy or is a named insured or is covered under any other policy providing uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage. (cf: P.L.2007, c.163, s.1) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Compulsory automobile insurance coverage; limits. Except as provided by section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1), every owner or registered owner of an automobile registered or principally garaged in this State shall maintain automobile liability insurance coverage, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of an automobile wherein such coverage shall be at least in: a.     an amount or limit of [$15,000.00] $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident; and b.    an amount or limit, subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of [$30,000.00] $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to or death of, more than one person, in any one accident; and c.     an amount or limit of [$5,000.00] $35,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. No licensed insurance carrier shall refuse to renew the required coverage stipulated by this act of an eligible person as defined in section 25 of P.L.1990, c.8 (C.17:33B-13) except in accordance with the provisions of section 26 of P.L.1988, c.119 (C.17:29C-7.1) or with the consent of the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. (cf: P.L.1998, c.21, s.3) 3.    Section 1 of P.L.1972, c.197 (C.39:6B-1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  Every owner or registered owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State shall maintain motor vehicle liability insurance coverage, under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a motor vehicle wherein such coverage shall be at least in: (1) an amount or limit of [$15,000.00] $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident; and (2) an amount or limit, subject to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of [$30,000.00] $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to or death of, more than one person, in any one accident; and (3) an amount or limit of [$5,000.00] $35,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, an owner or registered owner of an automobile, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), registered or [primarily] principally garaged in the State may satisfy the requirements of subsection a. of this section by maintaining a basic automobile insurance policy containing coverages provided pursuant to subsections a. and b. of section 4 of P.L.1998, c.21 (C.39:6A-3.1). c.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section, an owner or registered owner of an automobile, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-2), registered or [primarily] principally garaged in the State may satisfy the requirements of subsection a. of this section by maintaining a special automobile insurance policy containing coverages provided pursuant to subsection b. of section 45 of P.L.2003, c.89 (C.39:6A-3.3). (cf: P.L.2003, c.89, s.60) 4.    Section 13 of P.L.1983, c.362, (C.39:6A-4.3) is amended to read: 13.  Personal injury protection coverage options. With respect to personal injury protection coverage provided on an automobile in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4), the automobile insurer shall provide the following coverage options: a.     Medical expense benefit deductibles in amounts of $500.00, $1,000.00, $2,000.00 and $2,500.00 for any one accident; b.    The option to exclude all benefits offered under subsections b., c., d., and e. of section 4; c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1988, c.119.) d.    For policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 1991, the option that other health insurance coverage or benefits of the insured, including health care services provided by a health maintenance organization and any coverage or benefits provided under any federal or State program, are the primary coverage in regard to medical expense benefits pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4).  If health insurance coverage or benefits are primary, an automobile insurer providing medical expense benefits under personal injury protection coverage shall be liable for reasonable medical expenses not covered by the health insurance coverage or benefits up to the limit of the medical expense benefits coverage.  The principles of coordination of benefits shall apply to personal injury protection medical expense benefits coverage pursuant to this subsection; e.     Medical expense benefits in amounts of $150,000, $75,000, $50,000 or [$15,000] $25,000 per person per accident; except that, medical expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for all medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant brain injury, spinal cord injury or disfigurement or for medically necessary treatment of other permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care hospital immediately following the accident and until the patient is stable, no longer requires critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to another facility in the judgment of the attending physician.  The coverage election form shall contain a statement, clearly readable and in 12-point bold type, in a form approved by the commissioner, that election of any of the aforesaid medical expense benefits options results in less coverage than the $250,000 medical expense benefits coverage mandated prior to the effective date of P.L.1998, c.21. If none of the aforesaid medical expense benefits options is affirmatively chosen in writing, the policy shall provide $250,000 medical expense benefits coverage; f.     The insurer shall provide an appropriate reduction from the territorial base rate for personal injury protection coverage for those electing any of the options in subsections a., b., d. and e. of this section. Any named insured who chooses the option provided by subsection d. of this section shall provide proof that he and members of his family residing in his household are covered by health insurance coverage or benefits in a manner and to an extent approved by the commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a health insurer, health maintenance organization or governmental agency to cover individuals or treatment which is not normally covered under the applicable benefit contract or plan.  If it is determined that an insured who selected or is otherwise covered by the option provided in subsection d. of this section did not have such health coverage in effect at the time of an accident, medical expense benefits shall be payable by the person's automobile insurer and shall be subject to any deductible required by law or otherwise selected as an option pursuant to subsection a. of this section, any copayment required by law and an additional deductible in the amount of $750. An option elected by the named insured in accordance with this section shall apply only to the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured's household who is not a named insured under another automobile insurance policy, and not to any other person eligible for personal injury protection benefits required to be provided in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4). Medical expense benefits payable in any amount between the deductible selected pursuant to subsection a. of this section and $5,000.00 shall be subject to the copayment provided in the policy, if any. No insurer or health provider providing benefits to an insured who has elected a deductible pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall have a right of subrogation for the amount of benefits paid pursuant to a deductible elected thereunder or any applicable copayment. The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this section and may promulgate standards applicable to the coordination of personal injury protection medical expense benefits coverage. (cf: P.L.1998, c.22, s.3) 5.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month after enactment and shall apply to insurance policies entered into on or after that date. STATEMENT This bill increases certain minimum motor vehicle liability insurance requirements.  Specifically, the bill increases the amount of liability insurance coverage that every owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State must maintain: (1)  from $15,000 to $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident; (2)  from $30,000 to $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, more than one person, in any one accident; and (3)  from $5,000 to $35,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. The bill provides these same limits with regard to automobile insurance under section 3 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3) and motor vehicle liability insurance under section 1 of P.L.1972, c.197 (C. 39:6B-1) and section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1). An automobile means a private passenger automobile.  A motor vehicle includes all vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power, excepting such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and motorized bicycles. Thus, under the bill, all motor vehicles and private passenger automobile policies in the State, except those insured under the basic or special policy, would be required to have bodily injury liability coverage of at least $100,000 per person and $200,000 per accident, and $35,000 of liability coverage for property damage. The bill also amends the law concerning medical expense benefits options as part of the personal injury protection, or PIP, coverage, per person, per accident, under standard automobile policies.  Under the bill, the minimum amount of medical expense benefits an insured may choose as an alternative to the standard amount of medical expense benefits is increased from the current $15,000 to $25,000.  The current mandatory minimum of $250,000 for all medically necessary treatment of certain permanent or significant injuries remains intact.

With respect to personal injury protection coverage provided on an automobile in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4), the automobile insurer shall provide the following coverage options: a.     Medical expense benefit deductibles in amounts of $500.00, $1,000.00, $2,000.00 and $2,500.00 for any one accident; b.    The option to exclude all benefits offered under subsections b., c., d., and e. of section 4; c.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1988, c.119.) d.    For policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 1991, the option that other health insurance coverage or benefits of the insured, including health care services provided by a health maintenance organization and any coverage or benefits provided under any federal or State program, are the primary coverage in regard to medical expense benefits pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4).  If health insurance coverage or benefits are primary, an automobile insurer providing medical expense benefits under personal injury protection coverage shall be liable for reasonable medical expenses not covered by the health insurance coverage or benefits up to the limit of the medical expense benefits coverage.  The principles of coordination of benefits shall apply to personal injury protection medical expense benefits coverage pursuant to this subsection; e.     Medical expense benefits in amounts of $150,000, $75,000, $50,000 or [$15,000] $25,000 per person per accident; except that, medical expense benefits shall be paid in an amount not to exceed $250,000 for all medically necessary treatment of permanent or significant brain injury, spinal cord injury or disfigurement or for medically necessary treatment of other permanent or significant injuries rendered at a trauma center or acute care hospital immediately following the accident and until the patient is stable, no longer requires critical care and can be safely discharged or transferred to another facility in the judgment of the attending physician.  The coverage election form shall contain a statement, clearly readable and in 12-point bold type, in a form approved by the commissioner, that election of any of the aforesaid medical expense benefits options results in less coverage than the $250,000 medical expense benefits coverage mandated prior to the effective date of P.L.1998, c.21. If none of the aforesaid medical expense benefits options is affirmatively chosen in writing, the policy shall provide $250,000 medical expense benefits coverage; f.     The insurer shall provide an appropriate reduction from the territorial base rate for personal injury protection coverage for those electing any of the options in subsections a., b., d. and e. of this section. Any named insured who chooses the option provided by subsection d. of this section shall provide proof that he and members of his family residing in his household are covered by health insurance coverage or benefits in a manner and to an extent approved by the commissioner. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a health insurer, health maintenance organization or governmental agency to cover individuals or treatment which is not normally covered under the applicable benefit contract or plan.  If it is determined that an insured who selected or is otherwise covered by the option provided in subsection d. of this section did not have such health coverage in effect at the time of an accident, medical expense benefits shall be payable by the person's automobile insurer and shall be subject to any deductible required by law or otherwise selected as an option pursuant to subsection a. of this section, any copayment required by law and an additional deductible in the amount of $750. An option elected by the named insured in accordance with this section shall apply only to the named insured and any resident relative in the named insured's household who is not a named insured under another automobile insurance policy, and not to any other person eligible for personal injury protection benefits required to be provided in accordance with section 4 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-4). Medical expense benefits payable in any amount between the deductible selected pursuant to subsection a. of this section and $5,000.00 shall be subject to the copayment provided in the policy, if any. No insurer or health provider providing benefits to an insured who has elected a deductible pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall have a right of subrogation for the amount of benefits paid pursuant to a deductible elected thereunder or any applicable copayment. The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this section and may promulgate standards applicable to the coordination of personal injury protection medical expense benefits coverage. (cf: P.L.1998, c.22, s.3) 5.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month after enactment and shall apply to insurance policies entered into on or after that date. STATEMENT This bill increases certain minimum motor vehicle liability insurance requirements.  Specifically, the bill increases the amount of liability insurance coverage that every owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State must maintain: (1)  from $15,000 to $100,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident; (2)  from $30,000 to $200,000, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, more than one person, in any one accident; and (3)  from $5,000 to $35,000, exclusive of interest and costs, for damage to property in any one accident. The bill provides these same limits with regard to automobile insurance under section 3 of P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-3) and motor vehicle liability insurance under section 1 of P.L.1972, c.197 (C. 39:6B-1) and section 2 of P.L.1968, c.385 (C.17:28-1.1). An automobile means a private passenger automobile.  A motor vehicle includes all vehicles propelled otherwise than by muscular power, excepting such vehicles as run only upon rails or tracks and motorized bicycles. Thus, under the bill, all motor vehicles and private passenger automobile policies in the State, except those insured under the basic or special policy, would be required to have bodily injury liability coverage of at least $100,000 per person and $200,000 per accident, and $35,000 of liability coverage for property damage. The bill also amends the law concerning medical expense benefits options as part of the personal injury protection, or PIP, coverage, per person, per accident, under standard automobile policies.  Under the bill, the minimum amount of medical expense benefits an insured may choose as an alternative to the standard amount of medical expense benefits is increased from the current $15,000 to $25,000.  The current mandatory minimum of $250,000 for all medically necessary treatment of certain permanent or significant injuries remains intact.
