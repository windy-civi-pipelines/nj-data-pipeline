(cf: P.L.2003, c.189, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would modify the eligibility criteria for a business to qualify as a minority-owned or women-owned business under State law.  The bill specifies that an otherwise eligible minority-owned or women-owned business engaged in the procurement of materials and supplies would be eligible for certification although the business is not involved in the production or movement of inventory on hand, as long as the business: (1)  places an order for a product with a distributor or manufacturer; (2)  takes possession of the materials or supplies in the order by payment; (3)  assumes the risk of ownership of the materials or supplies; and (4)  causes the product, materials, or supplies to be shipped to a customer. The bill also requires the uniform procedure, which governs the certification of minority and womens businesses, to provide guidance for determining whether the beneficial owners of a business have created a shell company or other arrangement with the purpose or effect of evading the ownership requirements under the law.
