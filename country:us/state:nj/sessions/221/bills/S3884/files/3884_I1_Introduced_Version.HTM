class=HangingAnActChar> concerning occupational heat stress and supplementing
Title 34 of the Revised Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Heat is the leading
weather-related killer, and it is becoming more dangerous as 18 of the last 19
years were the hottest years on record.  Excessive heat can cause heat stroke
and even death if not treated properly.  It also exacerbates existing health problems
like asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease.  Workers in agriculture and
construction are at the highest risk, but the problem affects all workers
exposed to heat, including indoor workers without climate-controlled
environments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    From 1979 to 2022, more
than 14,000 Americans have died directly from heat-related causes, according to
the United States Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Four states already
have safety and health standards that cover workplace heat exposure. 
Washington has a state standard that covers outdoor heat exposure.  Minnesota
has a state standard that covers indoor heat exposure.  Oregon and California
both have state standards that cover indoor and outdoor heat exposure.  The
United States military has also issued heat protections. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States Department of Labor has
not adopted a heat stress standard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     In the absence of a
heat stress adopted by OSHA, New Jersey may through legislation and regulation
adopt a heat stress standard for the protection of employees against
heat-related illness and injury that applies to employers and employees in this
State both in private and public employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Amusement park&quot;
means any permanent outdoor facility or park where amusement rides are
available for use by the general public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commercial farm means: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) a farm management unit of
no less than five acres producing agricultural or horticultural products worth
$2,500 or more annually, and satisfying the eligibility criteria for

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) a farm management unit of less
than five acres, producing agricultural or horticultural products worth $50,000
or more annually and otherwise satisfying the eligibility criteria for
differential property taxation pursuant to the Farmland Assessment Act of
1964, P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.); or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) a farm management unit that
is a beekeeping operation producing honey or other agricultural or
horticultural apiary-related products, or providing crop pollination services,
worth $10,000 or more annually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development or the
commissioners designee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the

county, municipality, or school district in the State, or any agency,
authority, department, bureau, or instrumentality thereof acting directly or
indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Excessive heat means levels
of outdoor or indoor exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human
body to maintain normal body functions and may cause heat-related injury or
illness, including those that lead to death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Heat-related illness means a
medical condition resulting from the inability of the body to rid itself of
excess heat, including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat syncope,
and heat stroke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Heat stress means the net
load to which a worker is exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic
heat, environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an increase in

2025, the commissioner shall establish by rule a heat stress standard that
contains the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   A standard that

The commissioner may assess a civil penalty of $2,000 per day, following the
establishment, amendment, adoption, or readoption of rules by the commissioner,
against an employer for each day that it conducts business operations that are
in violation of the stop-work order.  A request for hearing shall not

Development and the New Jersey Department of Health, with advice and input from
the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University, shall
adopt a heat-related illness and injury prevention plan for all commercial farm
workers specific to operations conducted on commercial farms.  Any person
responsible for operations conducted on a commercial farm shall comply with
that standard and plan.  The heat-related illness and injury prevention plan
for all commercial farm workers shall include, at a minimum, water and rest
breaks, access to shaded areas or climate controlled spaces, an emergency
response for any employee who has suffered injury as a result of being exposed
to excessive heat, worker and supervisor training, and record-keeping
requirements.  Any violation of this act, or the rules and regulations
promulgated hereunder, by a commercial farm operator shall be a violation of
section 4 of P.L.1971, c.193 (C.34:9A-40).  To the extent that this section may

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development to establish by rule a heat
stress standard that contains the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a standard that
establishes heat stress levels for employees that, if exceeded, trigger actions
by employers to protect employees from heat-related illness and injury; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a requirement that each
employer develop, implement, and maintain an effective heat-related illness and
injury prevention plan for employees.  The Commissioner is required to develop
a model heat-related illness and injury prevention plan, consistent with the
provisions of the bill, that employers may adopt. Employers may develop their
own heat-related illness and injury prevention plan consistent with the
provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The heat-related illness and
injury prevention plan is required, to the extent permitted by federal law, to
be developed and implemented with the meaningful participation of employees and
employee representatives, including collective bargaining representatives; will
be tailored and specific to the hazards in the place of employment; will be in
writing in both English and in the language that each employee understands, if
that language is not English; and will be made available at a time and in a
manner set forth by the commissioner in rule, to employees, employee
representatives, including collective bargaining representatives, and to the
commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
commissioner may issue a stop-work order against the employer requiring
cessation of all business operations of the employer at one or more worksites
or across all of the employers worksites and places of business if the
commissioner determines, after either an initial determination as a result of
an audit of a business or an investigation pursuant to the bill, that an
employer is in violation of the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, after
initially creating a heat-related illness and injury prevention plan, employers
will be required to conduct an annual review to determine whether revisions to
their plans are necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that State
law align with federal law should a federal law or regulation establish a heat
stress standard that is more favorable to employees than State law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill exempts amusement
parks and certain operations that are directly involved in the protection of
life or property, such as evacuation, rescue, medical, structural firefighting,
law enforcement, lifeguarding, or the emergency restoration of essential
services, such as roads, bridges, utilities, and communications, when employees
are engaged in those operations, from the bills provisions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill addresses its application
to collective bargaining agreements, including, but not limited to,
circumstances in which the heat standards do not apply to certain collective
bargaining agreements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides the
Department of Agriculture with the power to develop a heat standard for
commercial farm operators in consultation with the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development and Department of Health and with advice and input from
the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station at Rutgers University, and the
bill otherwise excludes commercial farms from its requirements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill imposes
monetary penalties for violations of its provisions. </p>
