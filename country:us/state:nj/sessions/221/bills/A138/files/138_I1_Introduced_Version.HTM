class=HangingAnActChar> establishing a behavioral health court pilot program
and supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Administrative
Office of the Courts shall establish a behavioral health court pilot program in
accordance with section 2 of P.L.   , c.   (C.   )(pending before the
Legislature as this bill) in no fewer than two counties and no fewer than five
municipalities.  The pilot program shall take place only in municipalities and
counties that apply to the Administrative Office of the Courts to participate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  Any person who is
ineligible for probation due to a conviction for a crime which is subject to a
presumption of incarceration or a mandatory minimum period of parole
ineligibility, or whom the court otherwise finds appropriate for sentencing
under this section, may be sentenced to a term of behavioral health special
probation in accordance with this section.  Notwithstanding the presumption of
incarceration pursuant to the provisions of subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:44-1,
whenever a person is in need of behavioral health care services and is subject
to sentencing under this section is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for
an offense, other than one described in subsection b. of this section, the
court, upon notice to the prosecutor, may, on motion of the person, or on the
courts own motion, place the person on behavioral health special probation,
pursuant to P.L.   , c.   (C.   )(pending before the Legislature as this bill),
which shall be for a term of no less than one year and no more than three
years, as determined in the courts discretion, provided that the court finds
in the record that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person has undergone
a professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person is suffering from behavioral health issues; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the person is in need of
behavioral health care services within the meaning of section 2 of P.L.1997,
c.192 (C.26:2S-2) and was in need of behavioral health care services at the
time of the commission of the present offense; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   behavioral health care
services will serve to benefit the person by addressing the persons behavioral
health issues and will thereby reduce the likelihood that the person will
thereafter commit another offense;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the person did not
possess a firearm at the time of the present offense and did not possess a
firearm at the time of any pending criminal charge; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the person has not been
previously convicted on two or more separate occasions of crimes of the first
or second degree, other than those listed in paragraph (6) of this subsection;
or the person has not been previously convicted on two or more separate crimes,
where one of the crimes is a crime of the third degree and one of the crimes is
a crime of the first or second degree; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   the person has not been
previously convicted or adjudicated delinquent for, and does not have a pending
charge of murder, aggravated manslaughter, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated
assault, aggravated sexual assault or sexual assault, or a similar crime under
the laws of any other state or the United States;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7) a suitable treatment
facility licensed and approved by the Department of Human Services is able and
has agreed to provide appropriate treatment services; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   no danger to the
community will result from the person being placed on behavioral health special
probation pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In determining whether to
sentence the person pursuant to this section, the court shall consider all
relevant circumstances, and shall take judicial notice of any evidence,
testimony, or information adduced at the trial, plea hearing, or other court
proceedings, and shall also consider the presentence report and the results of
the professional diagnostic assessment to determine whether and to what extent
the person is in need of behavioral health care services and would benefit from
treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     As a condition of behavioral
health special probation, the court shall order the person to enter a behavioral
health care service treatment program at a facility licensed and approved by
the Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human
Services to administer behavioral health care services. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person shall not be
eligible for behavioral health special probation pursuant to this section if
the person is convicted of or adjudicated delinquent for: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a crime of the first
degree;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   a crime of the first or
second degree enumerated in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117
(C.2C:43-7.2), a crime of the second degree involving N.J.S.2C:15-1 or
N.J.S.2C:18-2; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   an offense that involved
the distribution or the conspiracy or attempt to distribute a controlled
dangerous substance, or its analog, to a juvenile near or on school property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The probation
department or other appropriate agency designated by the court to monitor or
supervise the person's behavioral health special probation shall report
periodically to the court as to the person's progress in behavioral health
treatment and compliance with court-imposed terms and conditions.  The behavioral
health treatment provider shall promptly report to the probation department or
other appropriate agency all significant failures by the person to comply with
any court-imposed term or condition of behavioral health special probation or
any requirements of the course of treatment, and shall immediately report any
act that would constitute an escape.  The probation department or other appropriate
agency shall immediately notify the court and the prosecutor in the event that,
for any reason, the behavioral health care service terminates the person's
participation in the course of treatment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    (1)  Upon a first
violation of any term or condition of the behavioral health special probation
authorized by this section or of any requirements of the course of treatment,
the court, in its discretion, may permanently revoke the persons behavioral
health special probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Upon a second or subsequent
violation of any term or condition of the behavioral health special probation
authorized by this section or of any requirements of the course of behavioral
health treatment, the court shall permanently revoke the person's behavioral
health special probation, unless the court finds on the record that there is a
substantial likelihood that the person will successfully complete the treatment
program if permitted to continue on behavioral health special probation, and
the court is clearly convinced, considering the nature and seriousness of the
violations, that no danger to the community will result from permitting the
person to continue on behavioral health special probation pursuant to this
section.  The court's determination to permit the person to continue on behavioral
health special probation following a second or subsequent violation pursuant to
this paragraph may be appealed by the prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In making its determination
whether to revoke behavioral health special probation, and whether to overcome
the presumption of revocation established in paragraph (2) of this subsection,
the court shall consider the nature and seriousness of the present infraction
and any past infractions in relation to the person's overall progress in the
course of treatment, and shall also consider the recommendations of the
treatment provider.  The court shall give added weight to the treatment
provider's recommendation that the person's behavioral health special probation
be permanently revoked, or to the treatment provider's opinion that the person
is not amenable to treatment or is not likely to complete the treatment program
successfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) If the court permanently
revokes the person's behavioral health special probation pursuant to this
subsection, the court shall impose any sentence that might have been imposed,
or that would have been required to be imposed, originally for the offense for
which the person was convicted or adjudicated delinquent.  If the court
determines or is required pursuant to any other provision of this chapter or
any other law to impose a term of imprisonment, the person shall receive credit
for any time served in custody pursuant to N.J.S.2C:45-1, and for each day
during which the person satisfactorily complied with the terms and conditions
of behavioral health special probation while committed pursuant to this section
to a residential treatment facility.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   Following a violation,
if the court permits the person to continue on behavioral health special
probation pursuant to this section, the court shall order the person to comply
with such additional terms and conditions, as are necessary to deter and
promptly detect any further violation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The court may, in lieu
of permanently revoking the person's behavioral health special probation, impose
a term of incarceration for a period of not less than 30 days nor more than two
months, after which the person's term of behavioral health special probation
pursuant to this section may be reinstated.  In determining whether to order a
period of incarceration in lieu of permanent revocation pursuant to this
subsection, the court shall consider the recommendations of the service
provider with respect to the likelihood that such confinement would serve to
motivate the person to make satisfactory progress in behavioral health care
services once behavioral health special probation is reinstated.  This
disposition may occur only once with respect to any person unless the court is
clearly convinced that there are compelling and extraordinary reasons to
justify reimposing this disposition with respect to the person.  Any such
determination by the court to reimpose this disposition may be appealed by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     (1).  A person who was
successfully discharged from a term of behavioral health special probation as
provided in this section may seek an expungement of all records and information
relating to the arrest, detention, conviction, and proceeding for any offense
enumerated in Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes that existed at the time of
discharge from behavioral health special probation by presenting an application
to the Superior Court in the county in which the person was sentenced to behavioral
health special probation, which contains a duly verified petition as provided
in N.J.S.2C:52-7 for each crime or offense sought to be expunged.  A person who
was convicted of any offense barred from expungement pursuant to subsection b.
or c. of N.J.S.2C:52-2, or who has been convicted of any crime or offense since
the date of discharge from behavioral health special probation shall not be
eligible to apply for an expungement under this paragraph.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  In addition, no
application for expungement shall be considered until any pending charges are
disposed.  It shall be the obligation of the prosecutor to notify the court of
any disqualifying convictions or any other factors related to public safety
that should be considered by the court when deciding to grant an expungement
under this paragraph.  The Superior Court shall consider the person's verified
petition and may order the expungement of all records and information relating
to all arrests, detentions, convictions, and proceedings of the person that
existed at the time of discharge from behavioral health special probation as
appropriate.  The court shall grant the relief requested, unless it finds that
the need for the availability of the records outweighs the desirability of
having the person freed from any disabilities associated with their
availability, or it finds that the person is otherwise ineligible for
expungement pursuant to this paragraph. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The Administrative
Office of the Courts shall monitor the behavioral health court pilot program
and report to the Legislature 12 months after the organization of the pilot
program and within six months after the expiration of the pilot program.  The
reports shall include the impact of the pilot program on criminal sentencing
and the courts calendar and workload.  The reports also shall evaluate the
effectiveness of the pilot program and recommend whether the program should be
continued or expanded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4. This act shall take effect
immediately and shall expire three years after the effective date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>STATEMENT</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a
behavioral health court pilot program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The goal of the behavioral
health court pilot program is to divert certain persons suffering from
behavioral health issues from the State prison system and into treatment
programs, thereby reducing the demand for State prison bed spaces and providing
treatment to eligible offenders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a person will
be eligible for court directed diversion when the individual has undergone a
professional diagnostic assessment and: (1) has no history of possessing a
firearm during the commission of an offense; (2) has no previous convictions or
pending charges for a serious violent offense; (3) has no convictions on two or
more separate occasions; (4) presents no danger to the community if placed on
probation; (5) is in need of behavioral health care services; and (6) will
benefit from the behavioral health treatment and monitoring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An individual who violates any
term or condition of the behavioral health special probation related to
behavioral health care treatment may have their probation revoked by the court. 
Upon a second violation, the court is required to revoke the behavioral health
special probation unless the court finds that there is a substantial likelihood
that the person will successfully complete the treatment program if permitted
to continue.  If a court permanently revokes a persons behavioral health
special probation, the court is required to impose any sentence that might have
been imposed, or that would have been required to be imposed, for the offense
for which the person was convicted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The court has the option, in
lieu of revocation of behavioral health special probation, to impose a term of
incarceration for a period of not less than 30 days nor more than two months,
after which the person's term of behavioral health special probation pursuant
to this section may be reinstated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person successfully
discharged from a term of behavioral health special probation may seek
expungement of all records and information relating to the arrest, detention,
conviction, and proceeding for any offense that existed at the time of
discharge. </p>
