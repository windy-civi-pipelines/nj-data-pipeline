STATEMENT This bill revises the Athletic Training Licensure Act, P.L.1984, c.203 (C.45:9-37.35 et seq.). The bill amends the definition of athletic training in the act to include the treatment of an individual for injury prevention and health management; the clinical evaluation and assessment of an individual for an injury or illness, or both; and the rehabilitation and reconditioning of an individuals injury or illness, or both. The bill also clarifies that nothing in the act is to be construed as authorizing the interpretation of data for the purpose of diagnosing disease, organic condition or the practice of various licensed health care professions, including the practice of medicine and surgery, chiropractic, podiatry, occupational therapy, physical therapy, or prosthetics, by a person who is not licensed to practice such profession. The bills revisions to the act include various amendments to delete references to athlete, thereby acknowledging the fact that athletic trainers provide services to persons generally, rather than athletes specifically. The bill requires athletic trainers to display, or carry on the athletic trainers person if displaying is not possible, a practicing license at any place the athletic trainer renders services. The bill also repeals a section of the act that prohibits an athletic trainer from practicing, or from being employed by any individual or entity to do, physical therapy procedures for reimbursement unless the athletic trainer is licensed pursuant to the Physical Therapist Licensing Act of 1983.
