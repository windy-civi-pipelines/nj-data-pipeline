This definition follows a recently adopted Streamline Sales and Use Tax Agreement (SSUTA) amendment that adds a definition for oral healthcare products that member states can use if they wish to exempt those products from their respective sales and use taxes. The SSUTA is a multistate agreement that allows businesses operating in various states to more easily comply with the sales and use taxes imposed by member states.  One of the ways in which the SSUTA simplifies the administration of sales and use tax laws is by requiring member states to adopt common definitions for the products that are subject to tax, thereby providing greater uniformity among member states tax bases.  Also, member states are permitted to exempt products from their respective sales and use tax provided that those exemptions are made in accordance with the product definitions contained within the SSUTA.  New Jersey has been a member of the SSUTA since 2005.
