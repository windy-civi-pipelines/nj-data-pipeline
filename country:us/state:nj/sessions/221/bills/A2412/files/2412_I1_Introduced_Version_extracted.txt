A taxpayer shall be eligible to claim the deductions set forth in this section regardless of income. d.   To be eligible for the deduction for amounts paid for lead-based paint hazard abatement, a taxpayer shall submit to the director an affidavit from the municipality where the residential property is located acknowledging the work done and amounts paid to a certified lead abatement contractor.
