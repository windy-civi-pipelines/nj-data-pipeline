Enacted as P.L.2019, c.59, the Medical Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act permits terminally ill persons to self-administer medication to end their lives under certain circumstances.  Under the enactment, it is a crime of the second degree to willfully alter or forge a request for medication pursuant to the act or to conceal or destroy a rescission of that request with the intent or effect of causing the patients death.  It is a crime of the third degree under the enactment to coerce or exert undue influence on a patient to request such medication.  This bill would upgrade both offenses to crimes of the first degree.  A crime of the first degree is generally punishable by a term of imprisonment of 10-20 years, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.  Under the bill, both crimes of the first degree would be punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 25 years without eligibility for parole.
