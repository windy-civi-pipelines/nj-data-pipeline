class=HangingAnActChar> </span>revising the Homelessness Prevention Program,
supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, and making an appropriation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The mortal threat posed
by the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the Governor and Legislature to take drastic
but necessary action.  Executive Order No. 103 of 2020 effectively shut down
the New Jersey economy on March 9, 2020, in order to hinder the rapid spread of
the virus and to limit as much as possible the number of infections, severe
illnesses, and deaths.  At the same time, the Governor and Legislature enacted
P.L.2020, c.1 (C.2A:18-59.3) and implemented a moratorium on evictions, so as
to ensure that households would be able to shelter in place and eliminate the
threat posed by displacement, overcrowding, and the resultant spread of the
virus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The foregoing measures caused
severe but unavoidable economic difficulties, which have deeply affected the
overall well-being of millions of New Jersey residents.  Tenants, who in
general have substantially lower-incomes and far less wealth than homeowners,
have been disproportionately affected:  a large and growing number of them
immediately became and remain unemployed or underemployed.  This is especially
so for lower-income people of color, who are predominantly tenants and who
continue to be victimized by the systemic and structural racism, which has left
them severely disadvantaged and extremely vulnerable to health emergencies and
economic downturns.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Millions of jobs in our
State and elsewhere have been permanently lost, and only around half of the
total number of jobs abruptly interrupted by the virus-driven shutdown have
returned.  The general consensus is that it will take many months or even years
for the devastatingly high unemployment to recede, and for the economy to
recover to anywhere near its pre-pandemic level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    As a result, not only
will hundreds of thousands of tenants in our State be unable to pay all or even
part of the rental arrearages caused by the pandemic when the moratorium ends,
but these tenants will also find it extremely difficult, or even impossible, to
make their current, ongoing monthly rental payments once they resume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     An overwhelming number
of struggling tenant households, disproportionately black and brown, will
therefore be at risk of eviction for non-payment of all or part of their
regular rent shortly after the moratorium is lifted.  Combining the number of
struggling tenants with the number of people at risk of displacement if the
arrearage issue is not addressed, it becomes clear that the resulting number of
evictions and the resulting overcrowding, will create conditions likely to fuel
the resurgence and spread of COVID-19, and threaten the health, safety, and
lives of their families, communities, and the society at large.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In Executive Order No.
106 of 2020, the Governor expressly stated that protection and preservation of
personal and public health was the primary reason driving the imposition of the
economic shutdown and eviction moratorium, a health-centered concern echoed and
reinforced by the national eviction moratorium subsequently mandated by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The need to strictly limit
eviction, now and for the foreseeable future, is undeniable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Efforts need to be made
to provide financial compensation directly to landlords who have suffered deep
economic losses through no fault of their tenants or themselves.  At the same
time, however, it is evident that, until the economy rebounds, hundreds of thousands
of tenants will need help paying their regular rent going forward once the
moratorium ends, in order to ensure some measure of security and stability for
their families and communities; provide landlords with the restored rental
income stream required to safely and efficiently operate their buildings; and,
most importantly, prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 that will threaten the
health and safety of tenants, landlords, and the public at large. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  As used in P.L.    ,
c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

including any necessary attachments.  Beginning the month following receipt of a
certification, the department shall increase or decrease the amount of subsidy
provided to the household in accordance with the subsidy category applicable to

increases in income shall not require a subsidy adjustment.</p>
