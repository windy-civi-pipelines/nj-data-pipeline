If the board of trustees does not have sufficient members qualified or available to serve on the Investment Committee, or determines to broaden the expertise of the Investment Committee, the board of trustees may request that the State Treasurer recommend one or more qualified individuals to sit on the committee. f.     At the end of six years following the enactment date of P.L.2018, c.55, the board of trustees shall conduct a review of the performance and funding levels of the retirement system, as compared to available market data including but, not limited to, the performance of the State Investment Council and Division of Investment with regard to the investment of other State-administered retirement systems or funds and other appropriate benchmarks, and may, based on a majority vote of the authorized membership of the board, petition the Legislature to consider legislation that reverts control of the system from the Board of Trustees to the State Investment Council and the Division of Investment.

(pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the benefit amount the member received in the previous calendar year, including previous cost-of-living adjustments granted under this section. c.  The adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall not exceed one percent if the members annual pension benefit exceeds $76,000 in the first calendar year following the enactment of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For every calendar year thereafter, the members annual pension benefits shall be adjusted annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items Series A (1967=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor, except that the adjustment shall be calculated at a rate not to exceed one percent.  The base calendar year utilized in calculating the adjustment in members benefits shall be the calendar year prior to the calendar year of the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the benefit amount the member received in the previous calendar year, including previous cost-of-living adjustments granted under this section. d.  After the first calendar year following the enactment of this act, P.L.    c.,    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in every calendar year thereafter, the $76,000 threshold established in subsections b. and c. of this section shall be adjusted annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items Series A (1967=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor, except that the adjustment shall be calculated at a rate not to exceed three percent.  Any adjustment in the $76,000 threshold established in subsections b. and c. of this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the threshold calculated in the previous calendar year, including previous adjustments granted under this section. e.  The adjustment in members pension benefits as provided pursuant to this section shall apply to such benefit entitlements granted prior to and in effect on the effective date of this act, but only for benefit payments made after that effective date.  No member of the retirement system shall be granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the member would have received if the adjustment had been applicable at the date of entitlement and the benefit that the member has received from the date of entitlement to that effective date. f.  The cost-of-living adjustments shall apply, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the monthly retirement allowance or pension of a retired member, and the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary, that is provided by the Police and Firemen's Retirement System established pursuant to P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-2 et seq.). g.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, if the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemens Retirement System fails to comply with the provisions of this section within six months following the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the State Treasurer shall be responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments required by this section. h.  The Legislature shall appropriate such monies from the General Fund as necessary to effectuate the provisions of this section that are sufficient to cover both State and local expenses, and shall reimburse each local employer in the Police and Firemens Retirement System for the full cost incurred.  The funding for the cost-of-living adjustments outlined in this section shall take precedence over any additional funding added to the annual State appropriations act by the Legislature through non-emergency supplemental appropriations, resolutions, or other changes to the Governors budget message. 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reinstates automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for annual pension, ordinary disability pension, or accidental disability pension retirement benefits for certain members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS).  Provisions contained in P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-16 et al.), signed into law on June 28, 2011, had suspended the automatic annual adjustment for current and future retirees and beneficiaries of PFRS and other State-administered retirement systems until those systems reach a target funded ratio.  Decades of underfunding those systems by the State had placed the systems in precarious financial conditions. Although this bill does not reinstate COLAs for other retirees, it serves as the first step in reinstating COLAs for all retirees of the State-administered retirement systems.  Through the prioritization of PFRS, the State will begin this process with retired first responders, police and firefighters, to provide them greater financial security and stability at a time when inflation has significantly eroded the value of their retirement benefit payments, which are already based on the lower salaries of years ago.  To that end, the bill includes restrictions intended to limit costs and focus on segments among PFRS retirees expected to be most in need of an immediate benefit. Under the bill, members of PFRS will receive automatic COLAs for annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits if the member has been retired and receiving retirement benefits for a minimum of ten years. Longer-term retirees generally will have lower pension benefits and be less able to obtain employment to offset the erosion of their benefits.  Members of PFRS who are hired more than 30 days following the effective date of this act will not be considered eligible to receive these automatic COLAs. Additionally, members who are enrolled in deferred retirement will not be considered eligible for these automatic COLAs, nor will members who retired with 20 or more years of service but less than 25 years of service.  The COLAs will only apply to future pension benefit payments.  The bill does not provide for retroactive COLAs. The adjustment in eligible members pension benefits will be calculated based on an amount up to $76,000 of a retirees benefit for the first year following the enactment of this bill.  Eligible members receiving up to $76,000 of pension benefits will receive a COLA tied to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.  This will ensure that greater initial benefits will be provided to those likely to be most in need. The adjustment in eligible members pension benefits will be limited to one percent if the member receives more than $76,000 in benefits for the first year following the enactment of the bill. After the first calendar year following the enactment of the bill, the $76,000 threshold will be adjusted annually according to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, except that the adjustment will be calculated at a rate not to exceed three percent. The bill also grants the cost-of-living adjustment to the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary that is provided by PFRS. Under the bill, if the Board of Trustees of PFRS fails to comply with the provisions of this bill within six months following the effective date, then the State Treasurer will be responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments. The bill requires the Legislature to appropriate monies from the General Fund as necessary to effectuate the cost-of-living adjustments established under the bill that are sufficient to cover both State and local expenses, and to reimburse each PFRS local employer for the full cost incurred.  The bill further provides that this appropriation will take precedence over any additional funding added to the annual State budget by the Legislature through non-emergency supplemental appropriations, resolutions, or other changes to the Governors budget message.

At least two of the members shall be members of the board of trustees.  At least one of the Audit Committee members shall have accounting, governmental auditing, or related financial expertise.  If the board of trustees does not have sufficient members qualified or available to serve on the Audit Committee, or wishes to broaden the expertise on the Audit Committee, the board of trustees may request that the State Treasurer recommend one or more qualified individuals to sit on the committee. (b)  The Audit Committee shall assist the board of trustees in retaining an independent auditor to conduct an audit of the retirement system's financial statements by making a recommendation to the board of trustees after engaging in an auditor selection process.  The auditor selection process shall be based upon public, competitive bidding principles and shall take place no less than once every five years. (c) In carrying out its duties, the Audit Committee shall proactively assist the board of trustees in overseeing the integrity and quality of the retirement system's finances and investments.  The Audit Committee shall: (i)  review and evaluate audit fees; (ii) when the committee believes that the auditor's performance is not adequate in quality or independence, recommend such steps as may be necessary to elicit appropriate performance, including replacement of the auditor; (iii) at least once every three years, obtain and review a report of the independent auditor describing for the preceding year: the independent auditor's internal quality control procedures; any material issues raised by the most recent internal quality control peer review, or by reviews conducted by governmental or professional authorities; and steps taken by the auditor to address such issues; (iv) regularly review with the independent auditor any audit problems, any risks of material statements due to fraud, and difficulties involving restrictions or attempts to restrict the auditor's activities and restrictions on access to information; (v) review the audited financial statements and interim statements and discuss them with the board of trustees.  These discussions shall include a review of particularly sensitive accounting estimates, reserves and accruals, judgmental areas, audit adjustments, whether recorded or not, and any other matters the Audit Committee or independent auditor shall deem appropriate; (vi) review internal control functions such as the planned scope of internal audit reviews, adequacy of staffing, actions to be taken as a result of internal audit findings, the effectiveness of electronic data processing procedures, and controls and related security programs; (vii) recommend policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management; and (viii) establish a permanent position of internal auditor, who shall be supervised by the executive director, but who may be discharged only by an affirmative vote of the majority of the board. (2) An Actuary Committee of no less than three members to assist in the selection and oversight of the actuary appointed by the board of trustees.  The Actuary Committee shall review the performance of the actuary appointed by the board of trustees.  If the performance of the actuary is not adequate in quality, the committee shall recommend such steps as may be necessary to elicit appropriate performance, including replacement of the actuary.

If the board of trustees does not have sufficient members qualified or available to serve on the Investment Committee, or determines to broaden the expertise of the Investment Committee, the board of trustees may request that the State Treasurer recommend one or more qualified individuals to sit on the committee. f.     At the end of six years following the enactment date of P.L.2018, c.55, the board of trustees shall conduct a review of the performance and funding levels of the retirement system, as compared to available market data including but, not limited to, the performance of the State Investment Council and Division of Investment with regard to the investment of other State-administered retirement systems or funds and other appropriate benchmarks, and may, based on a majority vote of the authorized membership of the board, petition the Legislature to consider legislation that reverts control of the system from the Board of Trustees to the State Investment Council and the Division of Investment. (cf: P.L.2018, c.55, s.15) 2. Section 2 of P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.  The monthly retirement allowance or pension originally granted to any retirant and the pension or survivorship benefit originally granted to any beneficiary shall be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of this act provided, however, that: a.    The maximum retirement allowance, without option, shall be considered the retirement allowance originally granted to any retirant who, at retirement, elected an Option I allowance pursuant to the provisions of the statutes stipulated in subsection b. of section 1 of this act (C.43:3B-1); and b.    the minimum pension granted to any beneficiary stipulated in subsection d. (4) of section 1 of this act (C.43:3B-1), shall be considered the pension originally granted to such beneficiary. Pension adjustments shall not be paid to retirants or beneficiaries who are not receiving their regular, full, monthly retirement allowances, pensions or survivorship benefits.  The adjustment granted under the provisions of this act shall be effective only on the first day of a month, shall be paid in monthly installments, and shall not be decreased, increased, revoked or repealed except as otherwise provided in this act.  No adjustment shall be due to a retirant or a beneficiary unless it constitutes a payment for an entire month; provided, however, that an adjustment shall be payable for the entire month in which the retirant or beneficiary dies. Commencing with the effective date of P.L.2011, c.78 and thereafter, no further adjustments to the monthly retirement allowance or pension originally granted to any retirant and the pension or survivorship benefit granted to any beneficiary shall be made in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1958, c.143 (C.43:3B-1 et seq.), unless the adjustment is reactivated as permitted by law.  This provision shall not reduce the monthly retirement benefit that a retirant or a beneficiary is receiving on the effective date of P.L.2011, c.78 when the benefit includes an adjustment granted prior to that effective date.  [The] Except as provided in section 3 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen's Retirement System may adjust the monthly retirement allowance or pension of its retired members in accordance with subsection b. of section 13 of P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-13). (cf: P.L.2018, c.55, s.1) 3.  (New Section)  a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen's Retirement System shall implement automatic cost-of-living adjustments subject to the provisions of this section for annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits for members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System. Members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System who have been retired and receiving retirement benefits for a minimum of ten years shall be considered eligible to receive cost-of-living adjustments under this section.  Members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System who are hired more than 30 days following the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall not be considered eligible to receive cost-of-living adjustments under this section. Members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System who are in deferred retirement shall not be eligible to receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments under this section. Members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System who retired with 20 or more years of service, but less than 25 years of service, shall not be eligible to receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments under this section. b.  The adjustment in members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall be calculated based on an amount up to $76,000 of a retirees annual pension benefit for the first calendar year following the enactment of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For every calendar year thereafter, the members annual pension benefits shall be adjusted annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items Series A (1967=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor.  The base calendar year utilized in calculating the adjustment in members benefits shall be the calendar year prior to the calendar year of the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c. (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the benefit amount the member received in the previous calendar year, including previous cost-of-living adjustments granted under this section. c.  The adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall not exceed one percent if the members annual pension benefit exceeds $76,000 in the first calendar year following the enactment of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  For every calendar year thereafter, the members annual pension benefits shall be adjusted annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items Series A (1967=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor, except that the adjustment shall be calculated at a rate not to exceed one percent.  The base calendar year utilized in calculating the adjustment in members benefits shall be the calendar year prior to the calendar year of the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  Any adjustment in a members annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits pursuant to this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the benefit amount the member received in the previous calendar year, including previous cost-of-living adjustments granted under this section. d.  After the first calendar year following the enactment of this act, P.L.    c.,    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in every calendar year thereafter, the $76,000 threshold established in subsections b. and c. of this section shall be adjusted annually according to the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, All Items Series A (1967=100), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the United States Department of Labor, except that the adjustment shall be calculated at a rate not to exceed three percent.  Any adjustment in the $76,000 threshold established in subsections b. and c. of this section shall be cumulative, meaning the adjustment shall be applied to the threshold calculated in the previous calendar year, including previous adjustments granted under this section. e.  The adjustment in members pension benefits as provided pursuant to this section shall apply to such benefit entitlements granted prior to and in effect on the effective date of this act, but only for benefit payments made after that effective date.  No member of the retirement system shall be granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the member would have received if the adjustment had been applicable at the date of entitlement and the benefit that the member has received from the date of entitlement to that effective date. f.  The cost-of-living adjustments shall apply, in accordance with the provisions of this section, to the monthly retirement allowance or pension of a retired member, and the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary, that is provided by the Police and Firemen's Retirement System established pursuant to P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-2 et seq.). g.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, if the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemens Retirement System fails to comply with the provisions of this section within six months following the effective date of this act, P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the State Treasurer shall be responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments required by this section. h.  The Legislature shall appropriate such monies from the General Fund as necessary to effectuate the provisions of this section that are sufficient to cover both State and local expenses, and shall reimburse each local employer in the Police and Firemens Retirement System for the full cost incurred.  The funding for the cost-of-living adjustments outlined in this section shall take precedence over any additional funding added to the annual State appropriations act by the Legislature through non-emergency supplemental appropriations, resolutions, or other changes to the Governors budget message. 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reinstates automatic cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for annual pension, ordinary disability pension, or accidental disability pension retirement benefits for certain members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS).  Provisions contained in P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-16 et al.), signed into law on June 28, 2011, had suspended the automatic annual adjustment for current and future retirees and beneficiaries of PFRS and other State-administered retirement systems until those systems reach a target funded ratio.  Decades of underfunding those systems by the State had placed the systems in precarious financial conditions. Although this bill does not reinstate COLAs for other retirees, it serves as the first step in reinstating COLAs for all retirees of the State-administered retirement systems.  Through the prioritization of PFRS, the State will begin this process with retired first responders, police and firefighters, to provide them greater financial security and stability at a time when inflation has significantly eroded the value of their retirement benefit payments, which are already based on the lower salaries of years ago.  To that end, the bill includes restrictions intended to limit costs and focus on segments among PFRS retirees expected to be most in need of an immediate benefit. Under the bill, members of PFRS will receive automatic COLAs for annual pension, ordinary disability pension, and accidental disability pension benefits if the member has been retired and receiving retirement benefits for a minimum of ten years. Longer-term retirees generally will have lower pension benefits and be less able to obtain employment to offset the erosion of their benefits.  Members of PFRS who are hired more than 30 days following the effective date of this act will not be considered eligible to receive these automatic COLAs. Additionally, members who are enrolled in deferred retirement will not be considered eligible for these automatic COLAs, nor will members who retired with 20 or more years of service but less than 25 years of service.  The COLAs will only apply to future pension benefit payments.  The bill does not provide for retroactive COLAs. The adjustment in eligible members pension benefits will be calculated based on an amount up to $76,000 of a retirees benefit for the first year following the enactment of this bill.  Eligible members receiving up to $76,000 of pension benefits will receive a COLA tied to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.  This will ensure that greater initial benefits will be provided to those likely to be most in need. The adjustment in eligible members pension benefits will be limited to one percent if the member receives more than $76,000 in benefits for the first year following the enactment of the bill. After the first calendar year following the enactment of the bill, the $76,000 threshold will be adjusted annually according to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, except that the adjustment will be calculated at a rate not to exceed three percent. The bill also grants the cost-of-living adjustment to the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary that is provided by PFRS. Under the bill, if the Board of Trustees of PFRS fails to comply with the provisions of this bill within six months following the effective date, then the State Treasurer will be responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments. The bill requires the Legislature to appropriate monies from the General Fund as necessary to effectuate the cost-of-living adjustments established under the bill that are sufficient to cover both State and local expenses, and to reimburse each PFRS local employer for the full cost incurred.  The bill further provides that this appropriation will take precedence over any additional funding added to the annual State budget by the Legislature through non-emergency supplemental appropriations, resolutions, or other changes to the Governors budget message.
