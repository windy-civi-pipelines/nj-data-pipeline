operation of the retirement system is hereby vested in a board of trustees,
and, as specified, the committees established pursuant to subsection e. of this
section.  The board may with the approval of at least eight members of the
board, in its discretion and at such time and in such manner as the board
determines, enhance any benefit set forth in P.L.1944, c.255 (C.43:16A-1 et

such benefit as an alternative to an increase in the member contribution rate,
which increase the board determines to be reasonable, necessary, and
appropriate, or reinstate, when appropriate, such reduced benefit to the
statutory level without an additional contribution by the member, so long as an
actuarial certification provided by the actuary demonstrates that such change
will not result in an increased employer contribution in the current year and
that such change will not impact the long term viability of the fund.  The
board shall act exclusively on behalf of the contributing employers, active
members of the retirement system, and retired members as the fiduciary of the
system.  The primary obligation of the board shall be to direct policies and
investments to achieve and maintain the full funding and continuation of the
retirement system for the exclusive benefit of its members.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill reinstates automatic
cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for annual pension, ordinary disability
pension, or accidental disability pension retirement benefits for certain
members of the Police and Firemens Retirement System (PFRS).  Provisions
contained in P.L.2011, c.78 (C.43:3C-16 et al.), signed into law on June 28,
2011, had suspended the automatic annual adjustment for current and future
retirees and beneficiaries of PFRS and other State-administered retirement
systems until those systems reach a target funded ratio.  Decades of
underfunding those systems by the State had placed the systems in precarious
financial conditions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Although this bill does not reinstate
COLAs for other retirees, it serves as the first step in reinstating COLAs for
all retirees of the State-administered retirement systems.  Through the
prioritization of PFRS, the State will begin this process with retired first
responders, police and firefighters, to provide them greater financial security
and stability at a time when inflation has significantly eroded the value of
their retirement benefit payments, which are already based on the lower
salaries of years ago.  To that end, the bill includes restrictions intended to
limit costs and focus on segments among PFRS retirees expected to be most in
need of an immediate benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, members of
PFRS will receive automatic COLAs for annual pension, ordinary disability
pension, and accidental disability pension benefits if the member has been
retired and receiving retirement benefits for a minimum of ten years. 
Longer-term retirees generally will have lower pension benefits and be less
able to obtain employment to offset the erosion of their benefits.  Members of
PFRS who are hired more than 30 days following the effective date of this act
will not be considered eligible to receive these automatic COLAs. 
Additionally, members who are enrolled in deferred retirement will not be considered
eligible for these automatic COLAs, nor will members who retired with 20 or
more years of service but less than 25 years of service.  The COLAs will only
apply to future pension benefit payments.  The bill does not provide for
retroactive COLAs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The adjustment in eligible
members pension benefits will be calculated based on an amount up to $76,000
of a retirees benefit for the first year following the enactment of this
bill.  Eligible members receiving up to $76,000 of pension benefits will receive
a COLA tied to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers.  This will
ensure that greater initial benefits will be provided to those likely to be
most in need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The adjustment in eligible
members pension benefits will be limited to one percent if the member receives
more than $76,000 in benefits for the first year following the enactment of the
bill.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After the first calendar year
following the enactment of the bill, the $76,000 threshold will be adjusted
annually according to the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers,
except that the adjustment will be calculated at a rate not to exceed three
percent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also grants the
cost-of-living adjustment to the monthly pension or survivorship benefit of a
surviving spouse, child, or beneficiary that is provided by PFRS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if the Board
of Trustees of PFRS fails to comply with the provisions of this bill within six
months following the effective date, then the State Treasurer will be
responsible for implementing the cost-of-living adjustments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
Legislature to appropriate monies from the General Fund as necessary to
effectuate the cost-of-living adjustments established under the bill that are
sufficient to cover both State and local expenses, and to reimburse each PFRS
local employer for the full cost incurred.  The bill further provides that this
appropriation will take precedence over any additional funding added to the
annual State budget by the Legislature through non-emergency supplemental appropriations,
resolutions, or other changes to the Governors budget message. </p>
