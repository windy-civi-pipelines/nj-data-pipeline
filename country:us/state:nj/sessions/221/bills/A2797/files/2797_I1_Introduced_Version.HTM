(2)   Subsections d. and e. of this section apply to the managers as well as the members and, subject to subsection d. of this section, a member does not have any duty to the company or any other member solely by reason of being a member. (3)   The power to ratify stated in subsection f. of this section pertains only to the members. j.     A member of a member-managed limited liability company and a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records of the limited liability company and upon information, opinions, reports, or statements presented by another manager, member, or liquidating trustee, an officer or employee of the limited liability company, or committees of the limited liability company, members, or managers, or by any other person as to matters the member or manager reasonably believes are within that other persons professional or expert competence, including information, opinions, reports, or statements as to the value and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, or losses of the limited liability company, or the value and amount of assets, reserves, or contracts, agreements or other undertakings that would be sufficient to pay claims and obligations of the limited liability company or to make reasonable provision to pay those claims and obligations, or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of assets from which distributions to members or creditors might properly be paid.  The protection afforded by this subsection shall extend to any claims under subsection c. of this section and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the member or manager breached the duty of care required of that member or manager. (cf: P.L.2012, c.50, s.39) 7.    Section 51 of P.L.2012, c.50 (C.42:2C-51) is amended to read as follows: 51.  Other Claims Against Dissolved Limited Liability Company. a.     A dissolved limited liability company may publish notice of its dissolution and request persons having claims against the company to present them in accordance with the notice. b.    The notice authorized by subsection a. of this section shall: (1)   be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in this State in which the dissolved limited liability company's principal office is located or, if it has none in this State, in the county in which the company's registered office is or was last located; (2)   describe the information required to be contained in a claim and provide a mailing address to which the claim is to be sent; [and] (3)   state [that a claim against the company is barred unless an action to enforce the claim is commenced within five years] the deadline for receipt of the claim, which may not be less than six months after publication of the notice; and (4)   state that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. c.     If a dissolved limited liability company publishes a notice in accordance with subsection b. of this section, [unless the claimant commences an action to enforce the claim against the company within five years after the publication date of the notice, the claim of each of the following claimants] a claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of subsection b. of this section are met and: (1)   the claim is not received by the specified deadline except in the case of a claimant [that did not receive notice in a record under section 50 of this act] who shows good cause for not having timely sent a claim, to the extent as the Superior Court may allow; or (2)   [a claimant whose claim was timely sent to the company but not acted on; and] if the claim is timely received but rejected by the company: (a)   the company causes the claimant to receive a notice in a record stating that the claim is rejected and will be barred unless the claimant commences an action against the company to enforce the claim within 90 days after the claimant received the notice; and (b)   the claimant does not commence the required action within 90 days. (3)   [a claimant whose claim is contingent at, or based on an event occurring after, the effective date of dissolution] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.     , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    A claim not barred under this section may be enforced: (1)   against a dissolved limited liability company, to the extent of its undistributed assets; and (2)   if assets of the company have been distributed after dissolution, against a member or transferee to the extent of that person's proportionate share of the claim or of the assets distributed to the member or transferee after dissolution, whichever is less, but a person's total liability for all claims under this paragraph does not exceed the total amount of assets distributed to the person after dissolution. (cf: P.L.2012, c.50, s.51) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes various revisions to the laws governing partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.  The revisions permit partnerships and limited partnerships to convert to and from other business entities and clarify indemnification standards, address notice issues, and make certain other changes to the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act. The bill provides that, pursuant to a plan of conversion, a partnership or limited partnership may convert into another business entity formed or organized under the laws of this State or any other state of the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, as provided in the plan of conversion.  The bill also provides that, pursuant to a plan of conversion, another business entity formed or organized under the laws of this State or any other state of the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction may convert into a domestic partnership or limited partnership, as provided in the plan of conversion.  Under the bill, other business entity means a business corporation, partnership, limited partnership, or a limited liability company. The bill provides that, in order for a limited liability company to use a name that is similar to that of another entity, a limited liability company must submit to the filing office a signed record of consent from the entity currently using the name in a form satisfactory to the filing office. The bill eliminates the requirement that a limited liability company must have a member before it may be formed.  Instead, a limited liability company is formed when the filing office has filed the certificate of formation, unless the certificate states a delayed effective date. Under the bill, a limited liability company shall indemnify a company agent against any debt, obligation, expense or other liability incurred by that company agent in the course of the company agent's activities on behalf of the limited liability company or another enterprise at the request of the limited liability company, if, in making the payment or incurring the debt, obligation, expense or other liability, the company agent: (1) is a member of a member-managed limited liability company or a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and complied with certain duties or (2) is other than a member of a member-managed limited liability company or a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and acted in good faith and in a manner the company agent reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the limited liability company. The bill provides that a member of a member-managed limited liability company and a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon certain information and records of the limited liability company.  This protection extends to claims that the applicable member or manager breached duty of care required of that member or manager. The bill shortens the time following the newspaper publication of notice of the dissolution of a limited liability company in which a claim against the limited liability company must be brought before the claim is barred, currently five years.  Under the bill, the claim must be received not less than six months following newspaper publication of notice.

(3)   [a claimant whose claim is contingent at, or based on an event occurring after, the effective date of dissolution] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.     , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). d.    A claim not barred under this section may be enforced: (1)   against a dissolved limited liability company, to the extent of its undistributed assets; and (2)   if assets of the company have been distributed after dissolution, against a member or transferee to the extent of that person's proportionate share of the claim or of the assets distributed to the member or transferee after dissolution, whichever is less, but a person's total liability for all claims under this paragraph does not exceed the total amount of assets distributed to the person after dissolution. (cf: P.L.2012, c.50, s.51) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill makes various revisions to the laws governing partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies.  The revisions permit partnerships and limited partnerships to convert to and from other business entities and clarify indemnification standards, address notice issues, and make certain other changes to the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act. The bill provides that, pursuant to a plan of conversion, a partnership or limited partnership may convert into another business entity formed or organized under the laws of this State or any other state of the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction, as provided in the plan of conversion.  The bill also provides that, pursuant to a plan of conversion, another business entity formed or organized under the laws of this State or any other state of the United States or any foreign country or other foreign jurisdiction may convert into a domestic partnership or limited partnership, as provided in the plan of conversion.  Under the bill, other business entity means a business corporation, partnership, limited partnership, or a limited liability company. The bill provides that, in order for a limited liability company to use a name that is similar to that of another entity, a limited liability company must submit to the filing office a signed record of consent from the entity currently using the name in a form satisfactory to the filing office. The bill eliminates the requirement that a limited liability company must have a member before it may be formed.  Instead, a limited liability company is formed when the filing office has filed the certificate of formation, unless the certificate states a delayed effective date. Under the bill, a limited liability company shall indemnify a company agent against any debt, obligation, expense or other liability incurred by that company agent in the course of the company agent's activities on behalf of the limited liability company or another enterprise at the request of the limited liability company, if, in making the payment or incurring the debt, obligation, expense or other liability, the company agent: (1) is a member of a member-managed limited liability company or a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and complied with certain duties or (2) is other than a member of a member-managed limited liability company or a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and acted in good faith and in a manner the company agent reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the limited liability company. The bill provides that a member of a member-managed limited liability company and a manager of a manager-managed limited liability company shall be fully protected in relying in good faith upon certain information and records of the limited liability company.  This protection extends to claims that the applicable member or manager breached duty of care required of that member or manager. The bill shortens the time following the newspaper publication of notice of the dissolution of a limited liability company in which a claim against the limited liability company must be brought before the claim is barred, currently five years.  Under the bill, the claim must be received not less than six months following newspaper publication of notice.
