Under current law, sales of services rendered in connection with the installation of carpeting and other flooring are subject to tax, regardless of whether the installation results in a capital improvement.  The law generally requires contractors, sub-contractors, and retail dealers who install carpeting and other flooring purchased by customers to collect and remit, to the State, the applicable tax associated with charges for installation services. The exclusion provided by this bill will alleviate the burden on contractors, sub-contractors, and retail dealers currently required to collect and remit the tax, and defray a portion of the overall cost associated with the purchase and installation of carpeting and other flooring that, when installed, constitutes a capital improvement.
