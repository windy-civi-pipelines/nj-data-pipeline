<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span>
concerning certain contracts to privatize State services and supplementing
chapter 24 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    It is the policy of this
State that State employees shall perform the public services of the State in
preference to contracting out those services to the private sector.  The
Legislature finds and declares that using private contractors to provide public
services formerly provided by State employees, or which are substantially
similar to and in lieu of services heretofore provided, or that could be
provided, in whole or in part, by State employees, does not always promote the
public interest.  To ensure that citizens of the State receive high quality public
service at a fair cost, and to ensure fair treatment of those State employees
who have been providing the public services, the Legislature finds it necessary
to regulate the circumstances which may result in the awarding of public
service contracts to private business entities, and to require that no decision
regarding the privatization of any service provided by the State should be made
without a careful evaluation of the long term impact of the privatization on
the State, its citizens and its employees. Therefore, no agency of the State
shall enter into a privatization contract and no such contract shall be valid
unless it complies with the conditions set forth in this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Agency&quot; includes,
but is not limited to, an executive officer, department, division, board,
commission or other office or officer in the executive branch of the State
government, or any authority or other instrumentality of the State, but does
not include any political subdivision of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Aggregate cost
savings&quot; with respect to a privatization contract means the amount by
which the net reduction of in-house costs exceeds the entire cost of the
privatization contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Entire cost of the
privatization contract means a detailed accounting of all costs under a
privatization contract, or pro-rata share of the costs, and all costs resulting
from the contract, including:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Costs of labor;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Costs of
employer-provided fringe benefits;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Costs of equipment or
materials, whether supplied by the State or a private contractor;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   All other costs directly
or indirectly attributable to transferring the work being performed by State
employees to a private business entity under the contract, including, but not
limited to, the costs of preparing and bidding the contract, the costs of
training the new workforce, bonding costs, insurance liability costs, costs to
the public of delayed or reduced services, and recovery costs of returning the
work to the agency if required by future decision makers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   Costs borne by the State
in the maintenance of any publicly supplied property, equipment or materials;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   Costs of administering,
inspecting or monitoring the contracted service, including, but not limited to,
the use of consultant services for this purpose;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   Cost of any anticipated
unemployment compensation or other benefits, including retraining expenses, for
State employees who are displaced as a result of the contracted service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   Cost of lost income tax
revenue and other tax revenue to the State through the elimination of agency
employees if the contractor performs functions outside of the State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Fringe benefits&quot;
means all employer-provided fringe benefits including health, dental, vision
care, prescription, holidays, vacations, sick and administrative leave,
pensions and other retirement benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Maintenance work&quot;
means the repair or maintenance of existing facilities when the size, type or
extent of those facilities is not thereby changed or increased.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Net reduction of
in-house costs&quot; means the net reduction of cost to an agency caused by the
agency not providing or performing a service which is instead performed or
provided by a private business entity under a privatization contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Private business
entity&quot; means a non-governmental person or entity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Privatization
contract&quot; means an agreement, modification of a prior agreement, or
combination or series of agreements between a private business entity and an
agency under which the entity performs or provides services substantially similar
to, and in lieu of, services heretofore provided, or that could be provided, in
whole or in part, by employees of the agency, except that &quot;privatization
contract&quot; shall not include any agreement between an agency and a private
business entity exclusively for the provision to the agency of services
substantially similar to those performed for the agency by managerial
executives as defined by subsection (f) of section 3 of P.L.1941, c.100
(C.34:13A-3), confidential employees as defined by subsection (g) of section 3
of P.L.1941, c.100 (C.34:13A-3) or State employees assigned to the senior
executive service pursuant to N.J.S.11A:3-3, or exclusively for the provision
of legal services to the agency, or any contract for public work under which
all non-managerial workers are required by law to be paid the prevailing wage
determined by the Commissioner of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the
&quot;New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act,&quot; P.L.1963, c.150 (C.34:11-56.25 et
seq.), and under which none of those workers are engaged in maintenance work.
To &quot;renew&quot; a privatization contract, or the &quot;renewal&quot; of
the contract, means entering into an agreement in which the type, scope and
amount of the work under the contract as renewed are the same as the type,
scope and amount of the work under the original contract, the added duration of
the contract is the same as the original contract, and the cost of the contract
as renewed is not more than the original<u> </u>contract except for a
reasonable cost of living adjustment.  To &quot;extend&quot; a privatization
contract, or the &quot;extension&quot; of the contract, means entering into an
agreement in which the type and scope of the work under the contract as
extended are the same as the type and scope of the work under the original
contract, the added duration of the contract is less than the original
contract, and the rate of cost of the contract as extended is not more than the
original contract except for a reasonable cost of living adjustment.  An
agreement which changes the type or scope of the work under a privatization
contract or increases the cost of a privatization contract by more than
$250,000 shall not be regarded as a renewal or extension of the contract, but
shall instead be regarded as a newly entered-into privatization contract,

statement which describes: the requirements of the contract; the procedures for
awarding the contract, which shall be in compliance with this act and all other

renewed or extended by an agency after the effective date of this act, the
agency, upon selecting a contractor but prior to making a final award of the
contract, shall prepare a certification that the contract complies with the
provisions of section 5 of this act and shall prepare a cost analysis of the
work to be performed under the contract, which shall be used to assess whether
it is more effective to use employees of the private business entity or to use
existing or additional agency employees to perform the work required.  The cost
analysis shall be based on the quantity and quality of service described in the
statement prepared by the agency pursuant to section 3 of this act and on the
agency's calculations of the net reduction of in-house costs attributable to
the privatization contract, of the entire cost of the contract, and of the
aggregate cost savings due to the contract.</p>

the Senate, or any representative of an employee organization representing
affected employees, or affected member of the public may, not more than 15 days
after the certification and cost analysis are made available to the public,
submit to the agency and the State Auditor written comments regarding the
certification, the cost analysis and the proposed privatization contract, and
may request the State Auditor to hold a public hearing on the proposed
contract. If the State Auditor determines that the nature of the privatization
contract warrants a hearing, or if the hearing is requested by the Speaker of
the General Assembly, the President of the Senate, or any union representing
affected employees, a public hearing shall be held not more than 30 days<span

of the public hearing shall be to gather testimony regarding all aspects of the
agency's plan to privatize the service which is the subject of the cost

adjustments to those calculations as it deems appropriate, and issue its
determination of the aggregate cost savings, if any, with respect to the
privatization contract, and its determination of whether the contract is in
full compliance with the provisions of this act.  The State Auditor shall, not
more than 30 days after receiving the certification and cost analysis pursuant
to subsection a. of this section, submit to the agency, and make available to
the public and representatives of the employee organizations representing
affected employees, together with copies of the documents submitted by the
bidder as part of the bid, a written report of its determination of the
aggregate cost savings of the contract and of any analysis or concerns the
State Auditor may have regarding the proposed contract and its determination of
whether the contract is in full compliance with the provisions of this act,
except that the State Auditor may extend, by not more than 30 days, the length
of time in which to submit the report, if needed to conduct a hearing or other
further investigation. If the State Auditor determines that the aggregate cost
savings of the contract are inadequate or the contract is otherwise not in conformance
with the requirements of this act, the agency may not make a final award of the
privatization contract and the contract shall not be valid.  If the State
Auditor does not determine that the contract is not in conformance with the

from the State Departments of Labor and Workforce Development, Environmental
Protection, Law and Public Safety and Health and Senior Services, regarding any
convictions, criminal convictions, debarments, suspensions or other measures
resulting from actions taken by a department for noncompliance of the

outweighed by any substantial reduction of the ability of the State to resume
the service as a State employee-provided service if the contracted service
proves not to be in the public interest, including a reduction caused by any
divestment of capital and equipment by the State in connection with the

less than what is provided to State employees performing the work and requires
the contractor to submit annual payroll reports to the agency, which shall be
available for public inspection, listing the hours worked and the hourly wage
paid for each employee who performed work under the contract.  The Attorney
General may bring a civil action for equitable relief in the Superior Court to
enforce this subsection or to prevent or remedy any noncompliance with the
provisions of this subsection;</p>

staffing levels sufficient to ensure that there is no deterioration in the
quality and quantity of services provided to the public and to provide staff
which has certification, licensing and levels of job proficiency equal to or
exceeding that of the public employees who would provide the services if there
was no privatization contract;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The contractor, and its

debarment, suspension, adjudication or conviction is due to substantial or
repeated noncompliance with any federal or state law regarding the operation of
a business, including, but not limited to, laws regarding labor relations,
workplace standards, occupational health and safety, public health and safety,
environmental protection, nondiscrimination and affirmative action, tax payment
and conflicts of interest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes requirements
and procedures regarding privatization contracts between State agencies and
private business entities under which the business entities provide services
substantially similar to services provided by State agency employees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that any
State agency, before soliciting bids or proposals for a privatization contract
or its renewal or extension, prepare and make available to the public a
statement describing: contract requirements; procedures for awarding the
contract; services subject to the contract; the wages and benefits of the
agency employees performing the work; and the anticipated net reduction of
in-house costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the agency,
upon selecting a contractor for any privatization contract with a total value
of more than $250,000, but before making a final award of the contract, to
prepare a cost analysis of the contract and certification that the contract
complies with the requirements of the bill.  The agency is required to make the
cost analysis and certification available to the public, the State Auditor and
affected employee organizations.  The Speaker of the General Assembly, the
President of the Senate or affected employee organization representative or
member of the public may, not more than 15 days after the certification and
cost analysis are made available, submit comments to the agency and the State
Auditor and request a public hearing.  The State Auditor is required to review
the certification and perform an audit of the agency's calculations and report
its own determination of the aggregate cost savings, if any, with respect to
the contract.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that for any
privatization contract with a total value of more than $250,000:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The contract results in
substantial aggregate cost savings not outweighed by the public's interest in
having the service performed directly by the State;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Displaced State workers
are given a right of first refusal for the jobs under the contract, or training
and other assistance if they choose not to work under the contract;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The contactor provides
workers under the contract with benefits and a rate of pay not less than that
provided to State employees performing the work;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    The contracted service
is the same as that performed by State employees in lieu of the privatization
contract, there is no increase in charges to the public and staffing levels are
maintained at the level needed to sustain the quality of the service;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    The contractor, its
subsidiaries and affiliates, and its managerial and supervisory employees have
not been subject to debarment, suspension, adjudication or conviction during
the 10-year period before the awarding of the contract or any criminal
conviction at any time and no principal or management employee of the
contractor worked in the preceding four years for the State in any capacity
related to work under the contract;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    The contractor discloses
every suit involving it or its subsidiaries or affiliates, and every report
regarding the contractor's ability to comply with the contract, and provides
copies of all requested union contracts, personnel manuals, and documents
describing fringe benefits, that cover its employees;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    The contract has a term
of not more than three years and states the contractor's liability for damages
arising out of contractor noncompliance, theft, damage, negligence or inability
of the contractor to perform;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    The contractor's
practices meet all applicable nondiscrimination and affirmative action
standards and the contract has no significant adverse effect on State
affirmative action efforts;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    For any privatization
contract to perform development work on an information technology-based system,
the contractor involves State employees in the work to ensure, as much as
practical, that their skills are upgraded enough to permit them to operate and
maintain the system and perform future development work; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  The contract is in
conformance with the provisions of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and subject to the provisions of any employee protection arrangement
established under 49 U.S.C. 5333(b).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the State
Auditor to conduct annual post audits of each privatization contract with a
total value of more than $250,000 and issue a report which includes evaluations
of any actual net reduction of in-house costs, the actual entire cost of the
contract and any actual aggregate cost savings of the contract, and a review of
the compliance of the agency and the contractor with the requirements of the
bill.</p>
