STATEMENT This bill expands the authority of midwives to prescribe drugs. Under current law, a certified nurse midwife (CNM) may be authorized to prescribe drugs if the CNM has completed 30 contact hours in pharmacology, with at least one credit hour on topics or issues concerning prescription opioid drugs.  A CNM who is approved to prescribe drugs is authorized to do so in accordance with standing orders and practice protocols developed in agreement between the CNM and a collaborative physician, which practice protocols are to be consistent with standards adopted by the State Board of Medical Examiners (BME).  Pursuant to BME regulations, CNMs are restricted to prescribing the drugs outlined in a formulary set forth in the clinical guidelines established between the CNM and the collaborating physician, which drugs may include controlled dangerous substances.  A licensed midwife is only authorized to prescribe a drug or medicine when preparing an ergot after the birth of the head of the infant, or household remedies, or to attend other than cases of labor. This bill would revise these requirements to provide that any certified midwife may prescribe drugs, and to remove requirements that the midwife do so in accordance with standing orders and practice protocols developed in agreement with a collaborative physician. The midwife would still be required to complete 30 hours of training in pharmacology, including one credit hour on topics and issues related to prescription opioid drugs.
