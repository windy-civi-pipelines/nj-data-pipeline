<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b><sup><span style='font-family:
"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    R.S.39:3-10 is amended
to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     39:3-10.  A person shall not
drive a motor vehicle on a public highway in this State unless the person is
under supervision while participating in a behind-the-wheel driving course
pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1977, c.25 (C.39:3-13.2a) or is in possession of a
validated permit, or a probationary or basic driver's license issued to that
person in accordance with this article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person under 18 years of age
shall not be issued a basic license to drive motor vehicles, and a person shall
not be issued a validated permit, including a validated examination permit,
until the applicant has passed a satisfactory examination and other
requirements as to the applicant's ability as an operator.  The examination
shall include:  a test of the applicant's vision; the applicant's ability to
understand traffic control devices; the applicant's knowledge of safe driving
practices, including the dangers of driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner,
which shall include, but not be limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of
a vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding
traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, and following
another vehicle too closely; the applicant's knowledge of the effects that
ingestion of alcohol or drugs has on a person's ability to operate a motor
vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning
from motor vehicles and techniques for the safe operation and proper
maintenance of a motor vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of portions of the
mechanism of motor vehicles as is necessary to insure the safe operation of a
vehicle of the kind or kinds indicated by the applicant; and the applicant's
knowledge of the laws and ordinary usages of the road.  A person shall not sit
for an examination for any permit without exhibiting photo identification
deemed acceptable by the commission, unless that person is a high school
student participating in a course of automobile driving education approved by
the State Department of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or
private school of this State, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127
(C.39:3-13.1).  The commission may waive the written law knowledge examination
for any person 18 years of age or older possessing a valid driver's license
issued by any other state, the District of Columbia, or the United States
Territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The
commission shall be required to provide that person with a booklet that
highlights those motor vehicle laws unique to New Jersey.  A road test shall be
required for a probationary license and serve as a demonstration of the
applicant's ability to operate a vehicle of the class designated.  During the
road test, an applicant may use a rear visibility system, parking sensors, or
other technology installed on the motor vehicle that enables the applicant to
view areas directly behind the vehicle or alerts the applicant of obstacles
while parking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person shall not sit for a
road test unless that person exhibits photo identification deemed acceptable by
the commission.  A high school student who has completed a course of
behind-the-wheel automobile driving education approved by the State Department
of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or private school of this State,
who has been issued a special learner's permit pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.1950, c.127 (C.39:3-13.1) prior to January 1, 2003, shall not be required
to exhibit photo identification in order to sit for a road test.  The
commission may waive the road test for any person 18 years of age or older
possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other state, the District of
Columbia, or the United States Territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto
Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The road test shall be given on public streets,
where practicable and feasible, but may be preceded by an off-street screening
process to assess basic skills.  The commission shall approve locations for the
road test which pose no more than a minimal risk of injury to the applicant, the
examiner, and other motorists.  New locations for the road test shall not be
approved unless the test can be given on public streets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person who successfully
completes a road test for a motorcycle license or a motorcycle endorsement when
operating a motorcycle or motorized scooter with an engine displacement of less
than 231 cubic centimeters shall be issued a motorcycle license or endorsement
restricting the person's operation of the vehicles to any motorcycle with an
engine displacement of 500 cubic centimeters or less.  A person who
successfully completes a road test for a motorcycle license or motorcycle
endorsement when operating a motorcycle with an engine displacement of 231 or
more cubic centimeters shall be issued a motorcycle license or endorsement
without any restriction as to engine displacement.  Any person who successfully
completes an approved motorcycle safety education course established pursuant
to the provisions of section 1 of P.L.1991, c.452 (C.27:5F-36) shall be issued
a motorcycle license or endorsement without restriction as to engine
displacement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall issue a
basic driver's license to operate a motor vehicle other than a motorcycle to a
person over 18 years of age who previously has not been licensed to drive a motor
vehicle in this State or another jurisdiction only if that person has:  (1)
operated a passenger automobile in compliance with the requirements of this
Title for not less than one year, not including any period of suspension or
postponement, from the date of issuance of a probationary license pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.1950, c.127 (C.39:3-13.4); (2) not been assessed more than two

driver's license to operate a motor vehicle or motorized bicycle in this State
shall surrender to the commission any current driver's license issued to the
applicant by another state or jurisdiction upon the applicant's receipt of a
driver's license for this State.  The commission shall refuse to issue a

applicant for a permit or license who is less than 18 years of age, and who
holds a permit or license for a passenger automobile issued by another state or

belts and automotive steering or any vehicle defined as a motorcycle pursuant
to R.S.39:1-1 having a motor with a maximum piston displacement that is less
than 50 cubic centimeters or a motor that is rated at no more than 1.5 brake
horsepower with a maximum speed of no more than 35 miles per hour on a flat
surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Omnibuses as classified
by R.S.39:3-10.1 and school buses classified under N.J.S.18A:39-1 et seq. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1999, c.28)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    All motor vehicles not
included in classifications a. and b. A license issued pursuant to this
classification d. shall be referred to as the &quot;basic driver's
license.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Every applicant for a license
under classification b. shall be a holder of a basic driver's license.  Any
issuance of a license under classification b. shall be by endorsement on the
basic driver's license.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A driver's license for
motorcycles may be issued separately, but if issued to the holder of a basic
driver's license, it shall be by endorsement on the basic driver's license. 
The holder of a basic driver's license or a separately issued motorcycle
license shall be authorized to operate a motorcycle having a motor with a
maximum piston displacement that is less than 50 cubic centimeters or a motor
that is rated at no more than 1.5 brake horsepower with a maximum speed no more
than 35 miles per hour on a flat surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission, upon payment
of the lawful fee and after it or a person authorized by it has examined the
applicant and is satisfied of the applicant's ability as an operator, may, in
its discretion, issue a license to the person to drive a motor vehicle.  The
license shall authorize the applicant to drive any registered vehicle, of the
kind or kinds indicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The license shall expire,
except as otherwise provided, during the fourth calendar year following the
date in which the license was issued and on the same calendar day as the
person's date of birth.  If the person's date of birth does not correspond to a
calendar day of the fourth calendar year, the license shall expire on the last
day of the person's birth month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission may, at its
discretion and for good cause shown, issue licenses which shall expire on a
date fixed by it. If the commission issues a license to a person who has
demonstrated authorization to be present in the United States for a period of
time shorter than the standard period of the license, the commission shall fix
the expiration date of the license at a date based on the period in which the
person is authorized to be present in the United States under federal
immigration laws.  The commission may renew the license only if it is
demonstrated that the person's continued presence in the United States is
authorized under federal law.  The fee for licenses with expiration dates fixed
by the commission shall be fixed by the commission in amounts proportionately
less or greater than the fee herein established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The required fee for a license
for the license period shall be as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Motorcycle license or
endorsement: $18.</p>

endorsement: $18.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Basic driver's license: $18.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall waive the
payment of fees for issuance of omnibus endorsements whenever an applicant
establishes to the commission's satisfaction that the applicant will use the
omnibus endorsement exclusively for operating omnibuses owned by a nonprofit
organization duly incorporated under Title 15 or 16 of the Revised Statutes or
Title 15A of the New Jersey Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission shall issue
licenses for the following license period on and after the first day of the
calendar month immediately preceding the commencement of the period, the
licenses to be effective immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All applications for renewals
of licenses shall be made in a manner prescribed by the commission and in
accordance with procedures established by it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission in its
discretion may refuse to grant a permit or license to drive motor vehicles to a
person who is, in its estimation, not a proper person to be granted a permit or
license, but a defect of the applicant shall not debar the applicant from
receiving a permit or license unless it can be shown by tests approved by the
commission that the defect incapacitates the applicant from safely operating a
motor vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to requiring an
applicant for a driver's license to submit satisfactory proof of identity and
age, the commission also shall require the applicant to provide, as a condition
for obtaining a permit and license, satisfactory proof that the applicant's
presence in the United States is authorized under federal law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the commission has reasonable
cause to suspect that any document presented by an applicant as proof of
identity, age, or legal residency is altered, false, or otherwise invalid, the
commission shall refuse to grant the permit or license until the time when the
document may be verified by the issuing agency to the commission's
satisfaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A person violating this
section shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment in the
county jail for not more than 60 days, but if that person has never been
licensed to drive in this State or any other jurisdiction, the <b><span

commission requiring the commission to refuse to issue a license to operate a
motor vehicle to the person for a period of not less than 180 days.  <u>The
court shall impose a period of imprisonment for not less than 45 days but not
more than 180 days, if a person is convicted of driving a motor vehicle when

a motor vehicle accident resulting in bodily injury to another person.</u>  The
penalties provided for by this paragraph shall not be applicable in cases where
failure to have actual possession of the operator's license is due to an
administrative or technical error by the commission.</p>
