CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution affirming New Jerseys commitment to the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution. Whereas, The U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1787, provides the framework for a government that upholds the rule of law, protects individual rights, and prevents the consolidation of power within any single branch or office; and Whereas, The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1951, establishing a limit of two elected terms for the President of the United States, ensuring a peaceful and democratic transition of executive power; and Whereas, When President George Washington left the presidency in 1797, he set the precedent of carrying out a maximum of two terms; and Whereas, The 22nd Amendment was passed in response to concerns over the unprecedented four-term presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Whereas, Historical precedent has demonstrated that unchecked executive power may lead to erosion of democratic institutions and imbalance among the three branches of government; and Whereas, Across the world, democratic nations employ various approaches to executive term limits, underscoring their importance in maintaining stability and accountability; and Whereas, The 22nd Amendment has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for several decades, with leaders from both major parties recognizing the necessity of preventing any individual from consolidating long-term control over the executive branch; and Whereas, Proposals to repeal or weaken the 22nd Amendment have been introduced in Congress multiple times but have consistently failed due to public and legislative opposition; and Whereas, Recent political discourse has raised concerns about potential efforts to challenge or undermine the 22nd amendment, threatening a long-standing safeguard of American democracy; and Whereas, Any attempt to repeal or modify the 22nd Amendment would require approval by two-thirds of both houses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states, necessitating a strong and unified response from states opposed to such changes; and Whereas, The State of New Jersey will not ratify a proposed amendment to overturn the 22nd Amendment; and Whereas, New Jersey is committed to upholding the principles of democratic governance, the rule of law, and the integrity of constitutional provisions that protect against excessive executive power; and Whereas, The people of New Jersey, through their elected representatives, have a vested interest in ensuring that no changes to the Presidential term limits are made without broad national consensus and clear justification; and Whereas, It is in the best interest of the State and the nation to reaffirm the importance of Presidential term limits in maintaining a balanced and accountable system of government; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The General Assembly affirms its commitment to the 22nd Amendment and its opposition to any effort to repeal or undermine the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, in defense of democratic traditions and constitutional safeguards. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President of the United States and to each member of Congress representing this State. STATEMENT This Assembly resolution affirms New Jerseys commitment to the 22nd Amendment to the United States Constitution. The State of New Jersey is devoted to the democratic principles enshrined in the United States Constitution, particularly the safeguards established by the 22nd Amendment, which limits the President to two elected terms in office.  This amendment, was ratified in 1951 in response to concerns over the accumulation of executive power after President Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected for four terms.  Since then, it has served as a vital mechanism for ensuring fair competition, accountability, and the peaceful transfer of power in the highest office of the land.  Presidential term limits have long been recognized as essential to preventing the concentration of authority in a single individual, preserving the balance of power among the branches of government, and maintaining public trust in the democratic process.  The amendment has enjoyed bipartisan support, and numerous attempts to repeal or weaken it have failed due to strong public and legislative opposition. Despite this historical precedent, recent political discourse has raised concerns about potential efforts to undermine the amendment, posing a threat to a long-standing safeguard of American democracy.  New Jersey, a state with a deep-rooted commitment to democratic governance and constitutional protections, opposes any attempt to repeal or modify the 22nd Amendment without broad national consensus and compelling justification. Recognizing that term limits serve as a critical check on executive power and reflect the will of the American people, the New Jersey General Assembly unequivocally declares that the state will not consent to any changes that would jeopardize the integrity of the 22nd Amendment.  New Jersey stands firm in its role as a defender of democratic principles and remains dedicated to upholding the constitutional provisions that protect the nation from excessive executive control.
