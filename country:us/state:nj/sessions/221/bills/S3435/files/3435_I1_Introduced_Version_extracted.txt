The State Treasurer shall choose one of the options pursuant to this subsection based on a determination of the best interests of the citizens of New Jersey.  At least seven business days prior to the award of a contract that includes the operation or maintenance of an official inspection facility pursuant to this section, the State Treasurer shall issue a notice of intent to award the contract and shall submit to the Legislature the notice of intent and a report describing the option chosen, which shall include an economic analysis of the three options listed in this subsection with respect to the operation or maintenance portion of the contract. b.    (1) A contract authorized by this section may, subject to the provisions of subsection f. of R.S.39:8-2, include the purchase, lease or sale of an interest in real or personal property.  The State Treasurer is authorized to exercise all authority of the Directors of the Division of Purchase and Property and of the Division of Building and Construction to award the contract or contracts authorized by this section as a single contract, multiple branch contracts or multiple single contracts.  Any contract awarded pursuant to this section shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of P.L.1954, c.48 (C.52:34-6 et seq.) and any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that act.  The provisions of R.S.52:32-2 shall not apply to any contract authorized by this section. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 35 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, the State Treasurer is not required to limit bids to persons who are prequalified.  The State Treasurer is authorized to require each person who submits a bid for a contract pursuant to this section to submit statements under oath in response to a questionnaire that develops fully that person's financial ability, adequacy of plant and equipment, organization, prior experience and any other facts pertinent and material to qualification, including qualification of any subcontractors, for the contract sought.  Any such questionnaire required shall be standardized with respect to, and shall be set forth in, each invitation to bid. (3)   Any other provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, and subject to guidelines for conflict of interest established by the Attorney General, for the purposes of this section a State officer or employee or a group of State officers or employees may enter into a contract or contracts as a private contractor.  A State officer or employee having any duties or responsibilities in connection with the evaluation or awarding of a contract pursuant to this section shall not individually or through any person or entity acting on behalf of that officer or employee bid on or enter into a contract as a private contractor. (4)   A contractor for the operation of an official inspection facility, or any of its officers or employees, may not be engaged in the business of selling, maintaining, or repairing motor vehicles or selling motor vehicle replacement or repair parts. A contractor's employees shall not be deemed employees of the State for any purpose. c.     A contract for the operation of an official inspection facility shall provide for motor vehicle inspection services that are consumer-friendly to the maximum extent feasible.

The [director] chief administrator shall develop a system of incentives that are designed to achieve average wait times of 15 minutes or less.  Data generated at any official inspection facility shall be the property of the State and shall be fully accessible to the [division] New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission at any time. e.     If a dispute over contract compliance, performance or termination cannot be resolved by the State Treasurer and the private contractor pursuant to the procedures set forth in a contract entered into pursuant to the provisions of this section, either party to the contract may file with the Superior Court a request either for an order either to terminate the contract or for an order for other appropriate relief to the dispute.  Any provision of N.J.S.59:13-5 to the contrary notwithstanding, the State Treasurer may consent to the filing of such a request prior to the expiration of 90 days from the date that the notice of claim is received.  The court may take such action as it may deem necessary to facilitate the expeditious resolution of the dispute and an expeditious response to the request, including ordering the parties to undertake dispute resolution, mediation, or arbitration as provided in N.J.S.59:13-7.  Within 90 days after the filing of a request, the court shall either grant the request or deny the request.  If the request is granted, the court shall order such appropriate relief measures or remedies as it deems appropriate and necessary. f.     (1) A person whose employment with the [Division of Motor Vehicles] New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission is terminated as a result of a contract entered into pursuant to subsection a. of this section, who does not accept an offer of employment with a contractor pursuant to paragraph (7) of subsection c. of this section, and who undergoes counseling pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1992, c.43 (C.34:15D-7), may apply for a training grant pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1992, c.43 (C.34:15D-6).

In the event of a sale, transfer of assets including contracts, or in the event of a merger with another company, the collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time shall be binding on any successors and assigns, including all purchasers of any assets, contracts, or the business.  The collective bargaining agreement shall be binding on any and all corporations, partnerships, organizations, and sole proprietorships affiliated with or related to doing business under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in effect.
