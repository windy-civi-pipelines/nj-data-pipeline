The activities that a justice or judge could participate in would be established by the Supreme Court by court rule and would be subject to Supreme Court regulation.  In a single year, the compensation for outside activities would be limited to no more than 15 percent of a justices or judges annual salary.  Additionally, a justice or judge could not receive compensation in the form of an honorarium directly related to the official duties or status of the justice or judge.

Const., Art. VI, Sec. VI, par. 6. The total compensation a justice or judge could receive in a single year would be limited to no more than 15 percent of the justices or judges annual salary.  Additionally, a justice or judge would not be permitted to receive compensation in the form of an honorarium, which is a payment of money or any other thing of value for an appearance, speech, or article directly related to the justices or judges official duties or status.
