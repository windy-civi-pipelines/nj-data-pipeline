By contrast, chiropractic adjustments are safe therapeutic treatments that can provide long-term relief for individuals with musculoskeletal conditions.  Research demonstrates the majority of individuals who received chiropractic treatments reported the treatments were effective, and were less likely to seek pain medications, surgery, or physical therapy.  By relieving pain and restoring mobility, chiropractic services can help New Jerseyans resume their lives and the activities that contribute to the culture and economic growth of the State of New Jersey This joint resolution designates October of each year as Chiropractic Health Month to promote awareness of chiropractic as safe, effective, drug-free treatments for musculoskeletal conditions.  The Governor is requested to issue a proclamation annually to recognize Chiropractic Health Month and call upon relevant State agencies, organizations, and citizens of the State to participate in appropriate activities.
