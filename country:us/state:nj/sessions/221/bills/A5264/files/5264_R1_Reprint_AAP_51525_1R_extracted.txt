A5264 1R [First Reprint] ASSEMBLY, No. 5264 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 10, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ROBERT J. KARABINCHAK District 18 (Middlesex) Assemblywoman  SHAMA A. HAIDER District 37 (Bergen) Assemblyman  WILLIAM W. SPEARMAN District 5 (Camden and Gloucester) Senator  JOHN F. MCKEON District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Park, Kane, Assemblymen Stanley, Sampson, Miller, Assemblywomen Drulis, Lopez, Assemblyman Calabrese, Senators Diegnan and Turner SYNOPSIS Requires establishment of automated platform to expedite construction code approval of applications to install residential solar energy systems. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Assembly Appropriations Committee on May 15, 2025, with amendments. An Act concerning the review and approval of residential solar energy systems and supplementing P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1. The Legislature finds and declares that: a. New Jersey has adopted a goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2035. b. Simplifying and enhancing the ability of New Jersey residents to install and use solar energy systems and home batteries 1[are] is1 an essential component of the States ability to attain this clean energy goal. c. Residential energy bills in New Jersey are among the highest in the country, imposing significant financial burdens upon New Jersey residents, and thereby exacerbating the States housing affordability crisis. d. Installation and use of rooftop solar energy systems is one way to enable New Jersey residents to significantly reduce residential electricity bills and thereby make housing more affordable. e. Vestiges of outdated, overly bureaucratic permitting requirements for installation of solar energy systems within New Jersey cause residents to significantly delay installation efforts and significantly increase costs incurred in installing residential solar energy storage systems across the 1[state] State1. f. New Jersey has the fifth slowest known solar permitting timelines of any state in the country. g. The Solar Energy Industries Association has estimated that permitting and other bureaucratic barriers within New Jersey typically increase the cost of installing a residential solar energy system by $6,000 to $7,000. h. The installation costs for a residential solar energy system in the United States 1[is] are1 approximately double the installation costs in Europe, largely because Europe has virtually eliminated permitting and other bureaucratic barriers. i. Approximately one-in-five residential solar energy installation projects are cancelled after submission of an application for a permit which, according to solar energy system installers, is largely a direct result of frustration experienced in attempting to maneuver through New Jerseys permitting 1[process] processes1. j. It has been reported that contractors who are in the business of installing residential solar energy systems and home batteries within New Jersey avoid entering into contracts to install systems within municipalities that impose especially burdensome permitting requirements 1and processes1. k. Hundreds of jurisdictions across the country, representing approximately 25 percent of the national market, have removed permitting barriers to the installation of residential solar energy systems and home energy battery storage by automating the permitting process. l. Residential solar and home energy storage projects that receive automated permits pass inspections at similar rates to residential solar and home energy storage projects that receive traditional permits. m. Automated permitting has the potential to reduce the costs of 1residential1 solar 1energy systems1, reduce installation timelines, and reduce cancellations, all of which will enable more families to install solar on their roofs and batteries in their garages. 2.  a.  As used in this section: "Department" means the Department of Community Affairs. "Enforcing agency" means the municipal or county construction official and subcode officials provided for in section 8 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-126), or section 1 of P.L.2018, c.157 (C.52:27D-126.8) regarding a pilot county in the "County Code Enforcement Pilot Program," and assistants thereto. "Form and format" means the arrangement, organization, configuration, structure, or style of, or method of delivery for, providing required information or providing the substantive equivalent of required information.  "Form and format" does not mean altering the substance of information or the addition or omission of information. "State Smart Solar Permitting Platform" means an Internet-based platform that, consistent with the "State Uniform Construction Code Act," P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.), automates plan review, produces a code-compliant approval, and instantly releases a permit or permit revision in response to the receipt of an acceptable application to construct a residential solar energy system. b.  (1)  The Commissioner of Community Affairs shall establish, develop, implement, and administer the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform for the purpose of automatically performing plan review of applications to construct a residential solar energy system, and to instantly release a permit or permit revision to construct a code-compliant residential solar energy system.  The commissioner shall fully implement the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform so that the platform is available for use by the department, enforcing agencies, and contractors prior to the first day of the 12th month next following the date of enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).
