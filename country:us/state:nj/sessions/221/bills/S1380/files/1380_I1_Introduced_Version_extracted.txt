The Civil Air Patrol was founded in 1936 by Gill Robb Wilson, a World War I aviator and the New Jersey director of aeronautics. Wilson envisioned mobilizing Americas civilian aviators for national defense and shortly after, launched his national program.  The Civil Air Patrol was approved by the federal government and national recruiting began on December 8th, 1941. Since the programs inception, the Civil Air Patrol has played key roles in World War II, the Cold War, and national defense in a post-9/11 world.  Today, the Civil Air Patrol continues to have a profound impact by aiding in mobilizations for COVID-19 by delivering supplies, building and staffing field hospitals and transporting vaccine vials.  The Civil Air Patrol also develops pertinent new programs and new technology, such as multispectral imaging for post-disaster damage assessment.
