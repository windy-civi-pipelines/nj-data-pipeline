law, members of a local unit governing body are subject to a personal penalty
of $25 for failure or refusal to comply with certain statutory responsibilities
related to local unit budget processes and operation of a local unit.  The bill
would increase the personal penalty to $100 for these violations and establish
a personal penalty of $100 for failure or refusal to comply with additional
existing requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For counties and municipalities
operating on a calendar fiscal year, the bill also increases the permissible
amount of a temporary budget, which is adopted in the first month of the fiscal
year and in effect for approximately three months, from 26.25 percent to 35
percent of the previous years total appropriations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
governing body or chief executive officer of any municipality may request a
review by the director of the behavior or practices of certain individuals
serving the local unit in a professional capacity.  The bill allows the
director to initiate a review of the behavior or practices of the following: registered
municipal clerk, certified tax collector, certified public works manager, and
qualified purchasing agent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill allows the
director to authorize an extension of the statutory deadlines for
municipalities to mail estimated property tax bills upon good cause shown and
upon terms or conditions the directors deems reasonable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would be effective on
the first day of the 13th month next following enactment and would apply to the
next local fiscal year beginning after that date. </p>
