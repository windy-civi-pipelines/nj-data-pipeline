No later than 24 months after the effective date of this act, the Department of Community Affairs, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection and the Board of Public Utilities, shall prepare and submit to the Governor and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), the Legislature a report that summarizes the information solicited at the public hearings required by subsection a. of this section and recommends legislative and regulatory actions related to greenhouse gas emissions from residential and commercial buildings in the State. 3.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would prohibit the Department of Community Affairs (DCA), the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the Board of Public Utilities (BPU), or any other State agency from adopting rules and regulations that mandate the use of electric heating systems or electric water heating systems as the sole or primary means of heating buildings or providing hot water to buildings, including, but not limited to, residences or commercial buildings.  The prohibition would remain in effect until the DCA issues a report on the costs and benefits of electric heating, as required by the bill. The bill would not prohibit a State agency from offering incentives for the voluntary installation or use of an electric heating or electric water heating system.  In addition, the bill would not prohibit a person from installing or using an electric heating system as the sole or primary means of heating a building or an electric water heating system as the sole or primary means of providing hot water to a building. The bill would require the DCA, in cooperation with the DEP and the BPU, to hold at least six public hearings throughout the State, within 18 months after the bill's enactment, to solicit information on topics related to the costs and benefits of electric heating systems and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from residential and commercial buildings in the State.  The bill would then require the DCA, in consultation with the DEP and the BPU, to publish, within 24 months after the bill's enactment, a report that summarizes the information submitted at the public hearings held pursuant to the bill, and recommends legislative and regulatory actions.  After the report is published, the bill's prohibition on regulatory actions to mandate the installation of electric heating systems or electric water heating systems would expire.
