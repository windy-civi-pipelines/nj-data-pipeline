S4100 SENATE, No. 4100 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 3, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  JOHN F. MCKEON District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Senator  LINDA R. GREENSTEIN District 14 (Mercer and Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Requires establishment of automated platform to expedite construction code approval of applications to install residential solar energy systems. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the review and approval of residential solar energy systems and supplementing P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-119 et seq.). Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  New Jersey has adopted a goal of 100 percent clean energy by 2035. b.  Simplifying and enhancing the ability of New Jersey residents to install and use solar energy systems and home batteries are an essential component of the States ability to attain this clean energy goal. c.  Residential energy bills in New Jersey are among the highest in the country, imposing significant financial burdens upon New Jersey residents, and thereby exacerbating the States housing affordability crisis. d.  Installation and use of rooftop solar energy systems is one way to enable New Jersey residents to significantly reduce residential electricity bills and thereby make housing more affordable. e.  Vestiges of outdated, overly bureaucratic permitting requirements for installation of solar energy systems within New Jersey cause residents to significantly delay installation efforts and significantly increase costs incurred in installing residential solar energy storage systems across the state. f.  New Jersey has the fifth slowest known solar permitting timelines of any state in the country. g.  The Solar Energy Industries Association has estimated that permitting and other bureaucratic barriers within New Jersey typically increase the cost of installing a residential solar energy system by $6,000 to $7,000. h.  The installation costs for a residential solar energy system in the United States is approximately double the installation costs in Europe, largely because Europe has virtually eliminated permitting and other bureaucratic barriers. i.  Approximately one-in-five residential solar energy installation projects are cancelled after submission of an application for a permit which, according to solar energy system installers, is largely a direct result of frustration experienced in attempting to maneuver through New Jerseys permitting process. j.  It has been reported that contractors who are in the business of installing residential solar energy systems and home batteries within New Jersey avoid entering into contracts to install systems within municipalities that impose especially burdensome permitting requirements. k.  Hundreds of jurisdictions across the country, representing approximately 25 percent of the national market, have removed permitting barriers to the installation of residential solar energy systems and home energy battery storage by automating the permitting process. l.  Residential solar and home energy storage projects that receive automated permits pass inspections at similar rates to residential solar and home energy storage projects that receive traditional permits. m.  Automated permitting has the potential to reduce the costs of solar, reduce installation timelines, and reduce cancellations, all of which will enable more families to install solar on their roofs and batteries in their garages. 2.  a.  As used in this section: "Department" means the Department of Community Affairs. "Enforcing agency" means the municipal or county construction official and subcode officials provided for in section 8 of P.L.1975, c.217 (C.52:27D-126), or section 1 of P.L.2018, c.157 (C.52:27D-126.8) regarding a pilot county in the "County Code Enforcement Pilot Program," and assistants thereto. "Form and format" means the arrangement, organization, configuration, structure, or style of, or method of delivery for, providing required information or providing the substantive equivalent of required information.  "Form and format" does not mean altering the substance of information or the addition or omission of information.

STATEMENT This bill expedites the review and approval of projects to install most types of residential solar energy systems.  The bill proposes to accomplish this by requiring the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) to establish and administer the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform within one year of the bills date of enactment.  Establishment of the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform will enhance the ability of a local enforcing agency: to review permit applications and permit revisions instantly for safety and code compliance, and to release permits and permit revisions instantly for residential solar energy systems, residential energy storage systems, main electric panel upgrades, and main electric panel derates. The State Smart Solar Permitting Platform is to automatically perform plan review of applications to construct a residential solar energy system, and instantly release permits or permit revisions to construct code-compliant residential solar energy systems. Under the bill, the term application to construct a residential solar energy system includes applications to construct a residential solar energy storage system submitted together with an application to perform a main electric panel upgrade, a main breaker derate, or both. The bill requires the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform to: · perform robust code compliance checks to evaluate proposed residential solar energy systems to determine whether they comply with the requirements of the State Uniform Construction Code; · produce construction documents to be used for inspection and recordkeeping purposes under the code; · instantly release a permit or permit revision to construct a residential solar energy system that complies with the code; · be designed to process 75 percent of residential solar energy system permit applications submitted; · be available for applicants to use 24 hours a day, except when the platform is down for an upgrade or maintenance; · be provided to the department at no-cost or low-cost if provided by a third party; · allow the use of electronic signatures on all applications and submitted materials necessary for issuance of a permit. The bill directs the commissioner to fully implement the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform and provide for its use within one year after the bill is enacted. The bill requires each local enforcing agency to either allow for the submission of applications to construct a residential solar energy system through the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform or through an alternative automated solar permitting platform that satisfies the requirements set forth in the bill for the State platform.  If a local enforcing agency opts to implement an alternative automated solar permitting platform, the bill requires the local enforcing agency to enable access to the alternative automated solar permitting platform within 18 months of the bills effective date. The bill requires each local enforcing agency that chooses to provide an alternative platform to the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform to submit a compliance report to the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) within 60 days of implementation of the alternative platform.  The bill requires a local compliance report to include: the date of compliance, the software used for compliance, and documentation showing that the alternative platform satisfies the requirements set forth in the bill in an equivalent manner as the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform. The bill provides that if the DCA determines that documentation submitted with a local compliance report is insufficient to verify that the alternative platform satisfies the bills requirements, the bill requires the local enforcing agency to provide the DCA with access to the alternative platform. The bill also requires a local enforcing agency that implements an alternative platform to submit an annual report to the DCA that complies with departmental guidelines and provides the following statutorily required information: · the number of permits released by the enforcing agency for residential solar energy systems through the alternative automated solar permitting platform and relevant characteristics of those systems; · the number of permits released by the enforcing agency for residential solar energy systems through means other than the alternative automated solar permitting platform and relevant characteristics of those systems; and · documentation showing that the alternative platform satisfies the other requirements set forth in the bill. If the DCA determines that documentation submitted by a local enforcing agency is insufficient to verify that the alternative platform meets the bills requirements, the bill requires the local enforcing agency to provide the DCA access to the platform. If the DCA determines that a local enforcing agency does not allow for submission of applications to construct a residential solar energy system through either the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform or through an alternative platform, the bill directs the DCA to impose a penalty upon, and collect penalty amounts from, the local enforcing agency, which amounts are to be allocated to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Additionally, the bill empowers the DCA to condition or deny direct funding to a local unit from any program it administers if the DCA determines that the local units enforcing agency is not in compliance with the bills requirements. The bill directs DCA to provide training opportunities concerning the use of the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform for employees of local enforcing agencies and authorizes the DCA to charge solar permit surcharge fees.  Monies collected by a local enforcing agency through solar permit surcharge fees are to be remitted to the DCA to defray the cost of developing and administering the State Smart Solar Permitting Platform.
