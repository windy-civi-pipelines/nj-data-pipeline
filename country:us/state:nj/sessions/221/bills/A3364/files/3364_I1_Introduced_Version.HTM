District 7 (Burlington) Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) SYNOPSIS Clarifies cap on fees imposed under County Option Hospital Fee Program Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning the County Option Hospital Fee Program Act and amending P.L.2018, c.136. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  Section 3 of P.L.2018, c.136 (C.30:4D-7t) is amended to read as follows: 3.  a.  There is established The County Option Hospital Fee Program in the Department of Human Services. b.  The purpose of the program is: (1) to increase financial resources through the Medicaid program to support local hospitals and to ensure that they continue to provide necessary services to low-income citizens; and (2) to provide participating counties with new fiscal resources. c.  Each participating county shall be authorized by the commissioner to impose a local healthcare-related fee on hospitals within its borders. d.  A participating county shall submit a proposed fee and expenditure report to the commissioner to ensure that the proposed fee and expenditure plan satisfies paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section and subsection e. of this section, and does not create a direct or indirect guarantee to hold harmless, as those terms are used in 42 C.F.R. s.433.68(f).  The commissioner shall further review the proposed fee and expenditure report to determine whether it complies with relevant rules and regulations.  Each participating county shall consult with affected hospitals within its jurisdiction to prepare the proposed fee and expenditure report before the report is submitted to the commissioner.  The commissioner shall make the proposed fee and expenditure report available to the affected hospitals for review and the hospitals shall be permitted to provide comments to the commissioner regarding the report for a period of 21 calendar days from the date the proposed report is made available for review. e.  The board of County commissioners of a participating county, following the approval of the participating county's proposed fee and expenditure plan by the commissioner, may adopt an ordinance providing for the imposition of a fee on hospitals located within its borders and for appropriate administrative provisions, including, but not limited to, provisions for the collection of interest and penalties. The fee shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. s.1396b(w)(3)(A), and shall be subject to the maximum aggregate amount that may be assessed pursuant to 42 C.F.R. s.433.68(f)(3), or any subsequent maximum amount as may be established by federal law, and shall be subject to [a cap as determined] review and approval by the commissioner.  The fee shall not exceed the aggregate amount specified in 42 C.F.R. s.433.68(f)(3) minus one percent of total net patient revenues.  The participating county may exempt a hospital within its jurisdiction from the fee, provided that the exemption complies with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. s.433.68. The fee authorized pursuant to this act may be collected only to the extent that the commissioner determines that the revenues generated qualify as the State share of Medicaid program expenditures eligible for federal financial participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. s.433.68. f.  Any subsequent alterations to the fee are subject to the approval of the commissioner prior to implementation.  Upon approval, the commissioner shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the changes and to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. g.  Neither the State nor a participating county shall be liable for any amount of a local healthcare-related fee imposed on a hospital pursuant to this act that the hospital fails to pay or does not pay in a timely manner to the assessing county. (cf: P.L. 2022, c.61, s.3) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends the County Option Hospital Fee Program Act, P.L.2018, c.136 (C.30:4D-7r et seq.).  Specifically, the bill removes the requirement that the fee implemented under the program be subject to a cap as determined by the Commissioner of Human Services, as currently provided under the law, and instead stipulates that the fee be subject to review and approval by the commissioner.  The provisions of the bill do not impact the commissioners authority to annually review and approve county option programs. The bill also specifies that the fee is not to exceed the aggregate amount specified in 42 C.F.R. s.433.68(f)(3) minus one percent of total net patient revenues.  Current law requires that the fee is to be implemented in accordance with federal law but does not mandate that the fee not exceed the aggregate amount specified in 42 C.F.R. s.433.68(f)(3) minus one percent of total net patient revenues.
