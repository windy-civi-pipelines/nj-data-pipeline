AR179 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 179 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MARCH 6, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  JOHN DIMAIO District 23 (Hunterdon, Somerset and Warren) Assemblyman  CHRISTOPHER P. DEPHILLIPS District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) Assemblyman  ANTWAN L. MCCLELLAN District 1 (Atlantic, Cape May and Cumberland) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblymen Bergen, Peterson and Kanitra SYNOPSIS Adopts articles of impeachment concerning Matthew Platkin, Attorney General. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Assembly Resolution adopting articles of impeachment in the matter of Matthew Platkin, providing for the presentation of articles to the Senate, and impeaching Matthew Platkin. Whereas, Matthew Platkin has repeatedly demonstrated his inability to perform his duties as Attorney General and has violated the public trust; and Whereas, Pursuant to statutory authority, one of Matthew Platkins responsibilities is to direct and supervise the Division of Criminal Justice.  In addition, pursuant to an Attorney General Law Enforcement Directive, the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability (OPIA) operates under the supervision of an Executive Director who is appointed by and operates under the authority and direct supervision of the Attorney General.  As a result, Matthew Platkin is responsible for the conduct of the Division of Criminal Justice and OPIA; and Whereas, In 1999, a consent decree was entered into by the State and the United States Justice Department following an investigation into the profiling of minority drivers on the States highways by the State Police.  The consent decree provided for federal oversight and monitoring of the State Police.  In 2009, after 10 years of federal oversight, the court dissolved the consent decree; and Whereas, Over that period of time, the State Police made significant reforms in the management and training of State Troopers, justifying the termination of the consent decree; and Whereas, In 2009, the reforms implemented by the State Police to end racial profiling were codified into law, with the State required to continue its oversight and monitoring of the State Police; and Whereas, Despite the significant reforms in the State Police, OPIA directed an independent study to be completed for the purpose of conducting an analysis of traffic stops made by the State Police; and Whereas, Despite data demonstrating compliance with legal obligations by the State Police, the study claims that the State Police continue to engage in targeted traffic stops of minorities.  The decision by OPIA to accept the results of the study rather than rely on decades of data and analysis created by the Office of the Attorney Generals own internal oversight unjustifiably discredits the State Police, erodes public confidence in the State Police, and violates the public trust; and Whereas, Further, certain disciplinary and criminal matters involving State Troopers are referred to either the Division of Criminal Justice for legal review or OPIA for criminal investigation; and Whereas, Currently, there remains a large number of unresolved cases that were referred to these entities, with 28 percent of these cases pending for more than one year. The ongoing delays in processing these cases affect a large number of State Troopers, as troopers that have administrative matters pending are ineligible for promotions and other career advancement; and Whereas, By not resolving these cases in a timely manner, there are significant violations of State Troopers due process rights; and Whereas, In addition, it has been reported that Matthew Platkin has failed to address other significant issues within OPIA.  As reported, the following cases demonstrate the recent failures of OPIA, which operates under the supervision of Matthew Platkin: in 2024, a judge dismissed charges filed by OPIA against Paterson police officer Jerry Moravek, as prosecutors found new evidence that was not presented to the Grand Jury; in 2022, a judge, upon petition by the Attorney Generals Office, dismissed charges against correctional police officer Ruben Morales due to errors during the interrogation; in 2022, a judge dismissed an indictment filed by OPIA against Saddle Brook Police Chief Robert Kugler, finding that the offices prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense; and in 2022, a judge ordered a new trial for Lakewood Rabbi Osher Eisemann, who the office accused of misappropriating funds at a school he founded for specials-needs children, as the judge found that the offices prosecutors withheld exculpatory evidence from the defense and in 2024 the indictment against Osher Eisemann was dismissed; and Whereas, According to news reports, there have been allegations that OPIA has acted unethically and that Matthew Plaktin has used the office to generate favorable headlines rather than requiring OPIA to base investigations on facts; and Whereas, In 2024, Matthew Platkin brought charges against George Norcross and five others, with news outlets reporting the indictment alleged a plot that used power over government officials in order to craft legislation that would aid them in obtaining property and property rights along the Camden waterfront "through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts"; and Whereas, In February 2025, a judge dismissed the indictments against George Norcross and his five co-defendants, finding that the factual allegations in the indictments do not constitute extortion or criminal coercion as a matter of law; and Whereas, According to news reports, there have been allegations by the attorneys for the defendants that the lawsuit initiated by Matthew Platkin was the product of political ambition, and one of the defendants attorneys called it a corrupt investigation; and Whereas, Further, based upon new reports, there have been additional claims by an attorney for George Norcross that Matthew Platkins tenure as the Attorney General of New Jersey will prove to be an epic failure, calling Matthew Platkin a politician masquerading as a law enforcement officer; and Whereas, As a result of his own political ambition, Matthew Platkin has used the Office of the Attorney General to target individuals he disagrees with politically, which has done professional and financial damage to these individuals and their families and has caused further damage to the reputation of the office; and Whereas, Additionally, this case has forced New Jersey taxpayers to be responsible for paying for the cost of the offices incompetence, and taxpayers deserve leadership without bias; and Whereas, Further, in 2023, after an incident in Paterson concerning an officer-involved shooting, Matthew Platkin directly superseded, or conducted a takeover of, the entire Paterson Police Department, without the consent of city officials.  In December 2024, an appellate court ruled that Matthew Platkin lacks the authority to take control of a municipal police department without the consent of city leaders; and Whereas, As a result, Matthew Platkin exceeded his statutory authority as Attorney General in superseding the Paterson Police Department.  Matthew Platkin filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, which has agreed to review the appellate ruling and issued a stay of the appellate court decision, leaving the Paterson Police Department under State control at this time; and Whereas, Additionally, it was reported that Matthew Platkin unilaterally issued a letter indicating that the Attorney Generals Office would not defend a State law in court proceedings that allows for a controversial party column design on county primary election ballots, with Matthew Platkin declaring that the law is unconstitutional; and Whereas, Based upon this conduct, Matthew Platkin failed to defend State law in court proceedings and made a unilateral decision on the constitutionality of State law, prompting Governor Murphy to issue the following statement in response: It is well-established that Attorneys General have a general obligation to defend the constitutionality of statutes, regardless of their own personal view; and Whereas, In addition, it has been reported that Katie Brennan, a volunteer on Governor Murphys 2017 campaign, indicated that she told Matthew Platkin, who was Governor Murphys chief counsel at the time, that one of the Governors campaign advisors sexually assaulted her; however, Matthew Platkin failed to take any action  on her complaint, which a legislative committee later investigating the matter labeled as one of several sloppy legal decisions; and Whereas, According to news reports, Matthew Platkin also has been condemned for providing certain legal advice to Governor Murphy as the Governors former chief counsel, especially regarding Governor Murphys controversial executive orders during the pandemic; and Whereas, The media has reported that there have also been accusations that Matthew Platkin targeted pro-life pregnancy centers due to the organizations religious speech and pro-life views by issuing an overbroad subpoena to one of these centers.  As reported, he aligned himself with Planned Parenthoods pro- abortion mission and enlisted its help to target pro-life pregnancy centers; and Whereas, The actions and inactions of Attorney General Matthew Platkin are incompatible with the responsibilities and duties owed to the public by the Attorney General; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The General Assembly, incorporating and adopting the above recitations as if stated fully herein, determines that Attorney General Matthew Platkin has engaged in a pattern and practice of disregarding the responsibilities and duties owed to the public by the Attorney General, and hereby adopts the following articles of impeachment: I.  Through his actions and inactions as Attorney General, Matthew Platkin has failed to address ongoing issues within the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. II.  As Attorney General, Matthew Platkin exceeded his statutory authority and unlawfully superseded the Paterson Police Department. III.  As Attorney General, Matthew Platkin has failed to defend State law in court proceedings and made a unilateral decision on the constitutionality of State law. IV. As Attorney General, Matthew Platkin targeted certain organizations based upon the political beliefs of the organization, specifically pro-life pregnancy centers. V. As Attorney General, Matthew Platkin has violated the public trust and failed to perform the duties of his office. 2.    In accordance with the New Jersey Constitution, Article VII, Section III, paragraph 2, by a majority of all the members, the General Assembly hereby impeaches Matthew Platkin. 3.    The Speaker of the General Assembly shall appoint a committee, of sufficient number, to act as managers for the purpose of presenting these articles of impeachment to the Senate forthwith. 4.    This resolution shall take effect upon its adoption by this House. STATEMENT This Assembly Resolution adopts articles of impeachment in the matter of Matthew Platkin, Attorney General, provides for the presentation of articles to the Senate, and impeaches Matthew Platkin. In light of his record of failing to address ongoing issues within the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability; exceeding his statutory authority and unlawfully superseding the Paterson Police Department; failing to defend State law in court proceedings and making a unilateral decision on the constitutionality of State law; targeting certain organizations based upon the political beliefs of the organization, specifically pro-life pregnancy centers; violating the public trust; and his overall failure to perform the duties of his office, it is altogether fitting and proper and within the public interest for the General Assembly to adopt articles of impeachment against Matthew Platkin, and present the articles to the New Jersey Senate in accordance with the New Jersey Constitution, Article VII, Section III, paragraph 2.
