(cf: P.L.2021, c.160, s.4) 4.    Section 7 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-275) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.  The authority, in collaboration with the director, shall adopt rules for the recapture of an entire or partial tax credit amount allowed under sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through C.34:1B-276).  The rules shall require the authority to notify the director of the recapture of an entire or partial tax credit amount.  Recaptured funds shall be deposited in the General Fund of the State. b.    If, before the end of five full years after the completion of the rehabilitation of the qualified property or transformative project, a developer that has received a tax credit pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-272) modifies the qualified property or transformative project so that it ceases to meet the requirements for the rehabilitation of a qualified property or transformative project as defined under the program or ceases to meet the requirement of the rehabilitation agreement then the tax credit allowed under the program shall be recaptured in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to subsection a. of this section. c.     In the case of a business entity that has chosen a selected rehabilitation period of 60 months, if the architectural plans change in the course of the phased rehabilitation project so that the rehabilitation of the qualified property or transformative project would, upon the rehabilitation's completion, no longer qualify for a tax credit pursuant to the requirements of sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through C.34:1B-276), then the [business entity's tax liability for that accounting or privilege period shall be increased by the full amount of the tax credit that the authority had previously granted upon the completion of a distinct prior project phase that the business entity has applied against its tax liability in a prior accounting or privilege period] tax credits issued shall be subject to recapture.  Any portion of the tax credit that the business entity has not yet used at the time of the disallowance by the officer shall be deemed void.

(2)   A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into a redevelopment agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be feasible if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3)   [As used in this subsection, "labor harmony agreement" means an agreement between a business that serves as the owner or operator of a retail establishment or distribution center and one or more labor organizations, which requires, for the duration of the agreement: that any participating labor organization and its members agree to refrain from picketing, work stoppages, boycotts, or other economic interference against the business;

STATEMENT This bill revises various provisions of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) concerning the Historic Property Reinvestment Program and the Brownfields Redevelopment Incentive Program. The Historic Property Reinvestment Program The bill revises the amount of credits that may be awarded to eligible business entities under the program. Specifically, the bill increases the maximum size of tax credits awarded under the program and allows for certain facade rehabilitation projects to be eligible for a tax credit award. Under the bill, the credits awarded for the rehabilitation of a qualified property located in a qualified incentive tract or government-restricted municipality are increased to 60 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $12 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 45 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $8 million, whichever is less.  The credits awarded for the rehabilitation of any other qualified property, other than a transformative project, are also increased to 50 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $8 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 40 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $4 million, whichever is less.  The bill also revises the tax credit eligibility requirement for a business to demonstrate a project financing gap to apply only to projects located outside of a government-restricted municipality that have a total rehabilitation cost or total façade rehabilitation cost of at least $5 million. The bill provides the Economic Development Authority (EDA) with the discretion to make up to 50 percent of the tax credits available for distribution in a given year to be made available for facade rehabilitation projects.  The value of tax credits awarded to a facade rehabilitation project are 50 percent of the projects cost of façade rehabilitation, up to a maximum of $4 million.  The bill defines facade rehabilitation projects to mean a project consisting of the repair or reconstruction of exterior building features, including but not limited to structural components embedded within exterior walls, masonry units and mortar, exterior siding fabric, doors, windows, exterior lighting fixtures, and decorative components, such as metalwork, terracotta units and cast stone which constitute the facades of a qualified property or transformative property. The Brownfields Redevelopment Incentive Program The bill revises various provisions relating to the application process for a developer and, following authority approval of the application, the subsequent redevelopment agreement between a developer and the authority.  The bill also provides that the EDA would accept applications on a rolling basis, unless the EDA determines that the demand for tax credits is likely to exceed the availability of credits, in which case applications would be reviewed on a competitive basis and submitted before a date certain. Under the bill, the value of credits awarded for the remediation of a redevelopment project located in a qualified incentive tract or government-restricted municipality is increased to up to 80 percent of the actual remediation costs, 80 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $12 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 60 percent of the actual remediation costs, 60 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $8 million, whichever is less. The bill specifies the amount of tax credits that may be awarded for a redevelopment project erecting a solar panel array on the site of a closed sanitary landfill.  If the project is located in a qualified incentive tract or a government-restricted municipality, the value of the tax credit would be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the costs of remediation or $12 million, whichever is less.  If the project is located anywhere else in the State, the value of tax credit would be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the costs of remediation or $8 million, whichever is less. Under the bill, the value of credits awarded for the remediation of all other redevelopment projects is increased to up to 60 percent of the actual remediation costs, 60 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $8 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 50 percent of the actual remediation costs, 50 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $4 million, whichever is less.

(2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may approve tax credits, pursuant to sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through C.34:1B-276), for the rehabilitation of a transformative project in an amount that causes the total amount of credits approved during the fiscal year to exceed the limitations set forth in section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-362), provided that the amount of the excess shall be subtracted from the total amount of credits that may be approved by the authority in the subsequent fiscal year, and the amount of the excess shall not exceed 50 percent of the total tax credits otherwise authorized for the fiscal year. (3)   The authority, in consultation with the officer, shall devise criteria for allocating tax credit amounts if the approved amounts combined exceed the total amount in each fiscal year, including rules that allocate over multiple fiscal years a single credit amount granted in excess of $2,000,000.  The criteria shall include a project's historic importance, positive impact on the surrounding neighborhood, economic sustainability, geographic diversity, and consistency with Statewide growth and development policies and plans. (4)   At the authority's discretion, up to 50 percent of the tax credits available for distribution in any given year may be allocated to facade rehabilitation projects.  The amount of credit allowed to a business entity pursuant to this paragraph shall be 50 percent of the cost of facade rehabilitation for a project or $4 million, whichever is less.  The tax credits allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall be awarded through a competitive application process whereby the authority shall evaluate all applications submitted by a date certain, as if all received applications were submitted on that date.  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 4 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-272), a project financing gap analysis shall not be required for the submission or approval of these applications.  When scoring applications, the authority shall consider factors including, but not limited to:  the retention of existing historic fabric versus demolition; building location, with preference given to buildings that contribute to the historic significance of a historic district; and the amount of community support for the project. d.    Notwithstanding any provision of the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to the contrary, the chief executive officer of the authority may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, rules and regulations necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill).  The rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall be effective for a period not to exceed 365 days following the date of filing and may thereafter be amended, adopted, or readopted by the director in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2021, c.160, s.4) 4.    Section 7 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-275) is amended to read as follows: 7.    a.  The authority, in collaboration with the director, shall adopt rules for the recapture of an entire or partial tax credit amount allowed under sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through C.34:1B-276).  The rules shall require the authority to notify the director of the recapture of an entire or partial tax credit amount.  Recaptured funds shall be deposited in the General Fund of the State. b.    If, before the end of five full years after the completion of the rehabilitation of the qualified property or transformative project, a developer that has received a tax credit pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-272) modifies the qualified property or transformative project so that it ceases to meet the requirements for the rehabilitation of a qualified property or transformative project as defined under the program or ceases to meet the requirement of the rehabilitation agreement then the tax credit allowed under the program shall be recaptured in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to subsection a. of this section. c.     In the case of a business entity that has chosen a selected rehabilitation period of 60 months, if the architectural plans change in the course of the phased rehabilitation project so that the rehabilitation of the qualified property or transformative project would, upon the rehabilitation's completion, no longer qualify for a tax credit pursuant to the requirements of sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through C.34:1B-276), then the [business entity's tax liability for that accounting or privilege period shall be increased by the full amount of the tax credit that the authority had previously granted upon the completion of a distinct prior project phase that the business entity has applied against its tax liability in a prior accounting or privilege period] tax credits issued shall be subject to recapture.  Any portion of the tax credit that the business entity has not yet used at the time of the disallowance by the officer shall be deemed void.

(2)   A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into a redevelopment agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be feasible if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3)   [As used in this subsection, "labor harmony agreement" means an agreement between a business that serves as the owner or operator of a retail establishment or distribution center and one or more labor organizations, which requires, for the duration of the agreement: that any participating labor organization and its members agree to refrain from picketing, work stoppages, boycotts, or other economic interference against the business; and that the business agrees to maintain a neutral posture with respect to efforts of any participating labor organization to represent employees at an establishment or other unit in the retail establishment or distribution center, agrees to permit the labor organization to have access to the employees, and agrees to guarantee to the labor organization the right to obtain recognition as the exclusive collective bargaining representatives of the employees in an establishment or unit at the retail establishment or distribution center by demonstrating to the New Jersey State Board of Mediation, Division of Private Employment Dispute Settlement, or a mutually agreed-upon, neutral, third-party, that a majority of workers in the unit have shown their preference for the labor organization to be their representative by signing authorization cards indicating that preference.  The labor organization or organizations shall be from a list of labor organizations that have requested to be on the list and that the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development has determined represent substantial numbers of retail or distribution center employees in the State.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) f.     The redevelopment agreement shall provide that issuance of a tax credit under the program shall be conditioned upon the subrogation to the department of all rights of the developer to recover remediation costs from any other person who discharges a hazardous substance or is in any way responsible, pursuant to section 8 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11g), for a hazardous substance that was discharged at the brownfield site. g.    A developer may seek a revision to the redevelopment agreement if the developer cannot complete the remediation on or before the date set forth in the redevelopment agreement.  A developer's ability to change the date on which the developer shall complete the remediation shall be subject to the availability of tax credits in the year of the revised date of completion. h.    A developer shall submit to the authority satisfactory evidence of the actual remediation costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, and a Licensed Site Remediation Professional for costs under the jurisdiction of the "Site Remediation Reform Act," sections 1 through 29 of P.L.2009, c.60 (C.58:10C-1 et seq.), and as applicable, other appropriate licensed or certified professional for costs that are not under the jurisdiction of the "Site Remediation Reform Act," evidence of completion of the remediation as demonstrated by a Response Action Outcome where the remediation is subject to the "Site Remediation Reform Act," a certification from the appropriate licensed or certified professional for other remedial activities, and a certification that all information provided by the developer to the authority is true, including information contained in the application, the redevelopment agreement, any amendment to the redevelopment agreement, and any other information submitted by the developer to the authority pursuant to sections 9 through 19 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-277 through C.34:1B-287).  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify under the penalty of perjury that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true. i.     The redevelopment agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to recapture the tax credits for any year in which the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Department of the Treasury that advises the authority that the developer is not in substantial good standing with the respective department, nor has the developer entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan for the developer.  The redevelopment agreement shall also include a provision allowing the authority to recapture the tax credits for any year in which the developer fails to confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the redevelopment project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in New Jersey; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  [The redevelopment agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health.] (cf: P.L.2021, c.160, s.7) 8.    Section 14 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-282) is amended to read as follows: 14.  [To] In addition to the submission of any additional evidence that the authority may request to verify that activities comply with local, state, and federal regulations, to qualify for a tax credit under the program, a developer shall, as applicable: a.     enter into [a memorandum of agreement] an administrative consent order or other oversight document with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection in accordance with the provisions of section 37 of P.L.1997, c.278 (C.58:10B-29);

STATEMENT This bill revises various provisions of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) concerning the Historic Property Reinvestment Program and the Brownfields Redevelopment Incentive Program. The Historic Property Reinvestment Program The bill revises the amount of credits that may be awarded to eligible business entities under the program. Specifically, the bill increases the maximum size of tax credits awarded under the program and allows for certain facade rehabilitation projects to be eligible for a tax credit award. Under the bill, the credits awarded for the rehabilitation of a qualified property located in a qualified incentive tract or government-restricted municipality are increased to 60 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $12 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 45 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $8 million, whichever is less.  The credits awarded for the rehabilitation of any other qualified property, other than a transformative project, are also increased to 50 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $8 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 40 percent of the cost of rehabilitation or $4 million, whichever is less.  The bill also revises the tax credit eligibility requirement for a business to demonstrate a project financing gap to apply only to projects located outside of a government-restricted municipality that have a total rehabilitation cost or total façade rehabilitation cost of at least $5 million. The bill provides the Economic Development Authority (EDA) with the discretion to make up to 50 percent of the tax credits available for distribution in a given year to be made available for facade rehabilitation projects.  The value of tax credits awarded to a facade rehabilitation project are 50 percent of the projects cost of façade rehabilitation, up to a maximum of $4 million.  The bill defines facade rehabilitation projects to mean a project consisting of the repair or reconstruction of exterior building features, including but not limited to structural components embedded within exterior walls, masonry units and mortar, exterior siding fabric, doors, windows, exterior lighting fixtures, and decorative components, such as metalwork, terracotta units and cast stone which constitute the facades of a qualified property or transformative property. The Brownfields Redevelopment Incentive Program The bill revises various provisions relating to the application process for a developer and, following authority approval of the application, the subsequent redevelopment agreement between a developer and the authority.  The bill also provides that the EDA would accept applications on a rolling basis, unless the EDA determines that the demand for tax credits is likely to exceed the availability of credits, in which case applications would be reviewed on a competitive basis and submitted before a date certain. Under the bill, the value of credits awarded for the remediation of a redevelopment project located in a qualified incentive tract or government-restricted municipality is increased to up to 80 percent of the actual remediation costs, 80 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $12 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 60 percent of the actual remediation costs, 60 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $8 million, whichever is less. The bill specifies the amount of tax credits that may be awarded for a redevelopment project erecting a solar panel array on the site of a closed sanitary landfill.  If the project is located in a qualified incentive tract or a government-restricted municipality, the value of the tax credit would be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the costs of remediation or $12 million, whichever is less.  If the project is located anywhere else in the State, the value of tax credit would be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the costs of remediation or $8 million, whichever is less. Under the bill, the value of credits awarded for the remediation of all other redevelopment projects is increased to up to 60 percent of the actual remediation costs, 60 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $8 million, whichever is less.  Under current law, these credit amounts are equal to 50 percent of the actual remediation costs, 50 percent of the projected remediation costs set forth in the redevelopment agreement, or $4 million, whichever is less.
