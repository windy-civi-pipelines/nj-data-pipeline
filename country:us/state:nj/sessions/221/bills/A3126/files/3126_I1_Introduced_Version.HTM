<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require school
districts and nonpublic schools participating in the National School Lunch
Program to provide free lunch, during the 2024-2025 school year, to students
who are federally eligible for free or reduced price school lunch, as well as
to students who are federally ineligible for free or reduced price school
meals, but who have an annual household income of not more than 249 percent of
the federal poverty level (FPL).  The bill would additionally amend existing
law at section 12 of P.L.2022, c.104 (C.18A:33-14a) to clarify that both public
and nonpublic schools offering school breakfasts to students in the State,
pursuant to the federal School Breakfast Program, will be required to provide
such breakfasts, free of charge, both to federally eligible students and to
students who are federally ineligible for free or reduced price school meals,
but who have an annual household income amounting to not less than 186 percent,
and not more than 199 percent, of the FPL.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under existing federal law, a
student is federally eligible to receive free or reduced price school lunch
under the National School Lunch Program, or free or reduced price school
breakfast under the federal School Breakfast Program, only if the student is
determined to be categorically eligible for such benefits (i.e., is determined
to be a homeless child, a migrant child, a runaway child, a foster child, or a
Head Start Child, or is a participant in certain public benefits programs) or
can demonstrate that the student lives in a low-income household (i.e., a
household with an annual income that is not more than 185 percent of the
federal poverty level).  Through the recent enactment of the Working Class
Families Anti-Hunger Act, P.L.2022, c.104 (C.18A:33-3.2 et al.), the State of
New Jersey has also provided for the expanded provision of free school lunches
and breakfasts to students in the State who reside in certain middle-income
families (i.e., those families having an annual household income of up to 199
percent of the FPL).  This bill would further amend and supplement the Working
Class Families Anti-Hunger Act to expressly apply the provisions of that
existing law to nonpublic schools that elect to participate in the National
School Lunch Program, and to additionally expand the income eligibility
standards applicable to students in the 2024-2025 school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All students who become newly
eligible for free school lunch, under the bills expanded, but term-limited,
income eligibility provisions, would be eligible to continue receiving such free
lunches through a summer meals program, and, if enrolled at a public school,
would also be able to continue receiving free lunches through an emergency
meals distribution program that is activated during a period of public school
closure resulting from COVID-19.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Consistent with the
reimbursement requirements established under the Working Class Families
Anti-Hunger Act, the bill would require the State to provide funding to each
school district and nonpublic school that participates in the National School
Lunch Program, as may be necessary to reimburse the costs associated with the
provision of free lunches thereby, in school year 2024-2025, to students who
are federally ineligible for such meals, but who satisfy the bills expanded,
State-level income eligibility requirements for that year.  The bill would
further require the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the
Department of Education, to establish a standardized means by which to review
the State reimbursement amounts being allocated under the bill, and under the
existing Working Class Families Anti-Hunger Act, in order to determine whether,
and the extent to which, participating school districts and nonpublic schools are
receiving adequate reimbursement, from the State, sufficient to account for
each participating schools actual costs of meal delivery, including, but not
limited to, food, labor, and other related costs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require each
report that is annually submitted, to the Governor and Legislature, on the
States school lunch and breakfast programs to identify, as appropriate, for
each participating school district and nonpublic school in the State:  (1) the
total number and percentage of students receiving subsidized school meals who
have been determined to be, respectively, federally eligible for free school lunch
or breakfast, federally eligible for reduced price school lunch or breakfast, income-eligible
for free school lunch or breakfast on the basis of State-level income
eligibility requirements, or neither categorically eligible nor income-eligible
for free or reduced price lunch or breakfast; and (2) the number and percentage
of such students who reside, respectively, in low-income families and in
middle-income families.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In addition to providing for
the term-limited expansion of income eligibility requirements necessary for
students to qualify for subsidized school lunches, the bill would also require
school districts and nonpublic schools participating in the National School
Lunch Program or the federal School Breakfast Program to take steps to minimize
or offset program costs, to the extent that such costs can be minimized or
offset without compromising the ability of the district or nonpublic school to
comply with minimum nutritional standards and other program requirements.  To
facilitate such legally compliant cost minimization activities, the bill would
require the Department of Agriculture, in consultation with the Department of
Education, to:  (1) monitor, inspect, and oversee school meals programs operating
in the State to ensure that school meals served thereunder continue to satisfy
minimum nutritional standards; (2) develop and publicize best practices,
protocols, and model plans to help participating school districts and nonpublic
schools effectively minimize and offset program costs without compromising the
nutritional value of meals being served; and (3) work cooperatively with each
participating school district and nonpublic school to review the program costs
being expended thereby, identify various means and methods by which those program
costs can be reduced, curtailed, or eliminated without sacrificing nutritional
value or legal compliance, provide relevant financial recommendations, and
undertake or recommend other appropriate actions to prevent the States school
meals programs from becoming overly bloated with unnecessary expenses and from otherwise
becoming financially burdensome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill would
require the Office of the Food Security Advocate to establish a Working Group
on School Food Security to identify and develop best practices, policies, and
plans, and to take other appropriate action, to promote and facilitate the
effective functioning of the States school meals programs and the expanded
provision, thereunder, of free school meals to students in the State.  Within
one year after its formation, and on a regular basis thereafter as deemed by
the food security advocate to be appropriate, the Working Group on School Food
Security would be tasked with:  (1) conducting a study on school food security
issues, in accordance with the bills provisions, and recommending further
State-level action to facilitate the provision of free school meals to enhanced
numbers or categories of students in the State; and (2) develop and publish a
plan to facilitate and promote the adoption, by the United States Congress and
President, of federal legislation authorizing the nationwide provision of free
school meals to all students in the country, and providing federal
reimbursement for all such meals served by schools and school districts in the
states.</p>
