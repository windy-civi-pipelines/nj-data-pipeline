<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill creates certain
requirements for earned income access service providers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, earned income
access services means the delivery of funds to a consumer that represent
earned but unpaid income and which should not be considered a loan.  Obligor
means an employer or another person who is contractually obligated to pay the
consumer any sum of money on an hourly, project-based, piecework, or other
basis for labor or services provided by the consumer.  The bill defines
consumer to mean a natural person working in the state of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an earned
income access service provider to offer earned income access services through a
contractual arrangement with an obligor or a service provider to an obligor, in
which the provider:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   reasonably verifies a
consumers earned income; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   delivers earned but
unpaid income to the consumer prior to the date on which the obligor is
scheduled to pay the consumer and the amount of the earned but unpaid income
delivered by the provider to the consumer is reduced or withheld from the
consumers next payment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits an obligor
from sharing information with an earned income access service provider
pertaining to the obligors accrued and expected obligations to the consumer
unless:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the obligor or service
provider to the obligor has entered into a contractual arrangement for earned
income access services with the earned income access service provider; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the consumer consents to
sharing that information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, if a provider
charges interest or finances charges, or their equivalent, to a consumer who
opts to use the services of an earned income access service provider,
determined by the application of a stated rate over a defined period of time,
then the provisions of the civil usury law and the criminal usury law are to
apply, except that this provision is not to apply to fees and voluntary
payments as defined pursuant to the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that any
earned income access services that fail to comply with the provisions of the
bill are subject to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the provisions of the
civil usury law and the criminal usury law;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   any provisions of Titles
17 or 56 of the Revised Statutes that would otherwise apply to a loan or credit
transaction; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the federal &quot;Truth
in Lending Act,&quot; 15 U.S.C. s.1601 et seq. and the regulations implementing
that act to provide any disclosures required for closed-end loans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Earned income access services
that do not comply with section 2 of the bill are to be considered a loan, even
if those services are provided without recourse, and any required fees, other
required contributions, or voluntary payments for those services are to be
considered as interest when determining the rate of interest for purposes of
compliance with a law with which an earned income access service provider is
required to comply pursuant to the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
person is not to offer earned income access services in this State without
first obtaining a license from the Department of Banking and Insurance in
accordance with the bill and paying the licensing or renewal fee, as
applicable, set by the department.  The department may issue a license to an
applicant only if the department is satisfied that the applicant possesses the
necessary organization, expertise, and financial integrity to supply the
services sought to be offered.  A license is to be valid for a period of one
year, is not to be transferable, and the application for a license is to be
granted or denied within 120 days of completed application.  The department may
suspend, revoke or place on probation a licensee with reasonable notice under
any of the following circumstances: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The licensee has engaged
in fraudulent activity that constitutes a violation of State or federal law; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The department has
received consumer complaints that justify an action to protect the safety and
interests of consumers; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The licensee fails to
comply with any requirement set forth in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the department
is authorized to establish relationships or contracts with the Nationwide<i> </i>Multistate
Licensing System and Registry, or other entities designated by the Nationwide
Multistate Licensing System and Registry to collect and maintain records and
process transaction fees or other fees related to licensees or other persons
subject to the bill.  The department may use the Nationwide Multistate
Licensing System and Registry as a channeling agent for requesting information
from, and distributing information to, the Department of Justice or any
governmental agency.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the
department investigate the business of all licensees, have free access, to the
books, papers, and records of any licensee, and examine, under oath, any person
whose testimony the department may require. The cost and charges of any such
examination or investigation are to be borne by the licensee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that no
license is to be issued by the department to an individual who has, within the
five years preceding the submission of an application for a license, been
convicted of embezzlement, forgery, fraud, or theft.</p>
