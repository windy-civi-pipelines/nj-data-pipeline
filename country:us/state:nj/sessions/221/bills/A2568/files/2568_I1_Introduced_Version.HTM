Upon determining that any vendor or provider of electronic communication service or remote computing service has violated subsection a. of this section, the court may enter a judgment for any or all of the following: (1)   liquidated damages in an amount not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000; (2)   a civil penalty in an amount not less than $5,000 nor more than $50,000; (3)   ineligibility for an award of any public contract for a period of three years; (4)   suspension or revocation of a license, franchise, certificates of incorporation, or privilege to do business in this State; and (5)   such other remedies as the court deems just, including injunctive relief. d.    Each separate violation of this section shall constitute a distinct violation and a separate sanction shall be imposed for each such violation. e.     The Attorney General shall adopt additional regulations for the enforcement of this section. f.     As used in this section, the terms "electronic communication service" and "remote computing service" shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of P.L.1968, c.409 (C.2A:156A-2), but shall be limited to those corporations, businesses or persons that provide such services to the public. g.    A provider of electronic communication services or remote computing services, including any employees, officers and agents, who makes any report pursuant to this section shall be immune from civil liability arising from such notification. 3.    This act shall take effect immediately.
