Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.1998, c.150 (C.36:2-50) is amended to read as follows: 2.    May 15th is permanently designated "Peace Officers Memorial Day" in New Jersey and the local governmental units and the citizens of this State, along with the residents of each community, are encouraged: a.     To join in the observance of Peace Officers Memorial Day on May 15th of each year in order to recognize, applaud and sincerely thank those men and women who, serving night and day as law enforcement officers, protect and safeguard our lives and property; b.    To honor all those law enforcement officers--federal, State and local--who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty by displaying at half-staff the flag of the United States on that day; [and] c.     To organize and sponsor appropriate ceremonies and activities reflective of the sincere and deep appreciation the citizens of our State and communities extend to the men and women of the law enforcement community; and d.    In the case of local governmental units, to promote the wearing of blue and in the case of citizens of our State and communities, to wear blue in order to demonstrate the sincere and deep appreciation these citizens have for the men and women of the law enforcement community who are dedicated to protecting and safeguarding our lives and property, despite the substantial risks they face each and every day. (cf: P.L.1998, c.150, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately STATEMENT This bill would encourage local governmental units to promote the wearing of blue, and the citizens of this State and the residents of each community to wear blue on Peace Officers Memorial Day in honor of the men and women of the law enforcement community. In New Jersey, May 15th is designated Peace Officers Memorial Day.  Each year on this day, the local governmental units and citizens of this State, along with the residents of each community, are encouraged to recognize, applaud, and sincerely thank those men and women who, serving night and day as law enforcement officers, protect and safeguard our lives and property.  They are encouraged to display the flag of the United States at half-staff in honor of all federal, State and local law enforcement officers who have been killed or disabled in the line of duty, and are encouraged to organize and sponsor appropriate ceremonies and activities which are reflective of the sincere and deep appreciation the citizens of our State and communities extend to the men and women of the law enforcement community. There are approximately 900,000 sworn law enforcement officers now serving in the United States.  Over the past 10 years, an average of 146 officers have died in the line of duty every year.  On average, there have been 58,930 assaults nationally against law enforcement officers which have resulted in 15,404 injuries each year. In light of the recent negativity directed toward law enforcement officers and an erosion of respect for their authority throughout this country, there is an urgent need to show that the citizens of our State have a sincere and deep appreciation for the men and women of the law enforcement community who, despite the substantial risks they face each and every day, are dedicated to protecting and safeguarding our lives and property.
