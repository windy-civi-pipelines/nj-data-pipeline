Under current law, parents may lose custody of their children for reasons which include, but are not limited to, being grossly immoral, unfit, or for neglecting the child.  Under the bill, if they have not had their parental rights terminated by the court, and the child is in the care or custody of a grandparent, then the parent or parents are required by the court to undergo a psychological examination before the court alters the custody arrangement, if altering the custody arrangement is appropriate. The bill also amends R.S.9:2-10 to direct the court to require a psychological examination of a parent or parents who have lost custody of their child and want to regain custody, but the child is in the care or custody of a grandparent, who has instituted an action for custody pursuant to R.S.9:2-9.
