ACR152 ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION No. 152 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED FEBRUARY 10, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ALIXON COLLAZOS-GILL District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Assemblywoman  ROSAURA "ROSY" BAGOLIE District 27 (Essex and Passaic) Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblyman Rodriguez SYNOPSIS Strongly condemns decision of President Trump to permit immigration enforcement actions in sensitive locations such as schools and hospitals. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Concurrent Resolution condemning the decision of President Donald J. Trump to permit immigration enforcement officers to take action in sensitive locations. Whereas, Since 2011, the Department of Homeland Security has maintained standing guidance requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to refrain from immigration enforcement action in sensitive locations that would restrain people's access to essential services or engagement in essential activities; and Whereas, In 2021, the Biden administration issued a memorandum expanding the definitions of these areas, which included: schools; healthcare facilities; places of worship; places where children gather, including playgrounds and bus stops; social service establishments, such as domestic violence shelters and food pantries; disaster and emergency response sites; weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies; and parades, demonstrations and rallies; and Whereas, ,The Biden administration issued a separate memorandum that limited the circumstances in which immigration enforcement actions could take place at courthouses; and Whereas, Only mere hours after President Donald J. Trump's inauguration, his administration revoked this Biden-era policy that prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents in these sensitive locations; and Whereas, These sensitive locations are areas and institutions that individuals, families, and children rely on for basic services and survival needs; and Whereas, ,  Long recognized as safe havens essential for public trust and the well-being of our communities, removing the protected status of these sensitive locations undermines this trust and prohibits vulnerable individuals from accessing critical resources and services; and Whereas, The rescission of this long standing policy to establish sensitive locations is a fear tactic used by the Trump administration to make immigrant families feel less safe in areas that are essential to civil society; and Whereas, This action has already created devastating consequences for    immigrant families and their children, including U.S. citizen children, deterring them from receiving medical attention, seeking disaster relief, attending school, and carrying out everyday activities; and Whereas, This State has long supported and encouraged equal access to education, healthcare, places of worship, and courts of law for all New Jersey residents, regardless of immigration status; and Whereas, This House denounces the decision of President Donald J. Trump to rescind the longstanding federal policy of prohibiting immigration enforcement officers from taking action in sensitive locations; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey (the Senate concurring): 1.    The Legislature of the State of New Jersey condemns the decision of President Donald J. Trump to rescind the longstanding federal policy of prohibiting immigration enforcement officers from taking action in sensitive locations. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the General Assembly to the President of the United States, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, and each member of Congress elected from this State. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution condemns the decision of President Donald J. Trump to rescind the longstanding federal policy of prohibiting immigration enforcement officers from taking action in sensitive locations, which included: schools; places of worship; hospitals and other healthcare facilities; shelters; relief centers; and public demonstrations, like rallies and protests. These sensitive locations have long been recognized as safe havens essential for public trust and the well-being of our communities. Removing the protected status of these locations undermines this trust and prohibits vulnerable individuals from accessing critical resources and service.  This resolution condemns the decision of President Donald J. Trump to rescind longstanding federal policy and reaffirms New Jerseys commitment to providing equal access to essential services.
