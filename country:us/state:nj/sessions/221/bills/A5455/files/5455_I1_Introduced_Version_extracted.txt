The commission is required to report annually to the Governor and to the Legislature regarding its activities, findings, and recommendations. Under current law, a majority of the commissions authorized membership is required to achieve a quorum. Accordingly, nine members must be present in order for the commission to perform its duties. Due to vacancies in the commission, this requirement can make it difficult to achieve a quorum, and can result in an inability of the commission to perform its duties.  The provisions of the bill would authorize the commission to exercise its powers and perform its duties when a majority of the commissions current members are present, rather than a fixed number of nine members.
