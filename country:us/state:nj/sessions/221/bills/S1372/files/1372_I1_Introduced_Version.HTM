Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.1979,
c.264 (C.2C:33-15) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a. (1) Any person under
the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages, or under the legal age to
purchase cannabis items, who knowingly possesses without legal authority or who
knowingly consumes any alcoholic beverage, cannabis item, marijuana, or hashish
in any school, public conveyance, public place, or place of public assembly, or
motor vehicle shall be subject to the following consequences:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   for a first violation, a
written warning issued by a law enforcement officer to the underage person. The
written warning shall include the person's name, address, and date of birth,
and a copy of the warning containing this information, plus a sworn statement
that includes a description of the relevant facts and circumstances that
support the officer's determination that the person committed the violation,
shall be temporarily maintained in accordance with this section only for the
purposes of determining a second or subsequent violation subject to the
consequences set forth in subparagraph (b) or (c) of this paragraph. If the
violation of this section is by a person under 18 years of age, a written
notification concerning the violation shall be provided to the parent, guardian
or other person having legal custody of the underage person in accordance with
section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   for a second violation,
a written warning issued by a law enforcement officer to the underage person
indicating that a second violation has occurred, which includes the person's
name, address, and date of birth. If the violation is by a person 18 years of
age or older, the officer shall provide the person with informational materials
about how to access community services provided by public or private agencies
and organizations that shall assist the person with opportunities to access
further social services, including, but not limited to, counseling, tutoring
programs, mentoring services, and faith-based or other community initiatives.
If the violation is by a person under 18 years of age, a written notification
concerning the second violation shall be provided to the parent, guardian or
other person having legal custody of the underage person in accordance with
section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a). The written notification shall
include the same or similar informational materials about how to access
community services provided by public or private agencies and organizations as
those provided directly by a law enforcement officer to a person 18 years of
age or older who commits a second violation of this paragraph. A copy of the
second written warning to the underage person, and, if applicable, the written
notification to the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of
the underage person concerning the second warning, plus a sworn statement that
includes a description of the relevant facts and circumstances that support the
officer's determination that the person committed the second violation, shall
be temporarily maintained in accordance with this section only for the purposes
of determining a subsequent violation subject to the consequences set forth in
subparagraph (c) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   for a third or
subsequent violation, a write-up issued by a law enforcement officer to the
underage person indicating that a third or subsequent violation has occurred,
which includes the person's name, address, and date of birth. If the violation
is by a person 18 years of age or older, the officer shall include with the write-up
a referral for accessing community services provided by a public or private
agency or organization, and provide notice to that agency or organization of
the referral which may also be used to initiate contact with the person, and
the agency or organization shall offer assistance to the person with
opportunities to access further social services, including but not limited to
counseling, tutoring programs, mentoring services, and faith-based or other
community initiatives. If the violation is by a person under 18 years of age, a
written notification concerning the third or subsequent violation shall be
provided to the parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the
underage person in accordance with section 3 of P.L.1991, c.169 (C.33:1-81.1a).
The written notification shall include a referral for the person and the
parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage person
for accessing community services provided by a public or private agency or
organization, and provide notice to that agency or organization of the referral
which may also then be used to initiate contact with both persons, and the
agency or organization shall offer assistance to both with opportunities to
access further social services, including counseling, tutoring programs,
mentoring services, and faith-based or other community initiatives. A copy of a
write-up for a third or subsequent violation, the written notification to the
parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage person,
if applicable, and accompanying referrals, plus a sworn statement that includes
a description of the relevant facts and circumstances that support the
officer's determination that the person committed the third or subsequent
violation, shall be temporarily maintained in accordance with this section only
to the extent necessary to track referrals to agencies and organizations, as
well as for the purposes of determining a subsequent violation subject to the
consequences set forth in this subparagraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The failure of a person under
the legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items, or the failure
of a parent, guardian or other person having legal custody of the underage
person, to accept assistance from an agency or organization to which a law enforcement
referral was made, or to access any community services provided by that agency
or organization shall not result in any summons, initiation of a complaint, or
other legal action to be adjudicated and enforced in any court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  (a)  A person under the
legal age to purchase alcoholic beverages or cannabis items is not capable of
giving lawful consent to a search to determine a violation of this section, and
a law enforcement officer shall not request that a person consent to a search
for that purpose.</p>
