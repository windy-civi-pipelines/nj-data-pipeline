profile, upload posts, view the posts of other users, or otherwise interact
with other users.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Information content provider
means any individual or entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for

of the total content on the website or on any individual webpage contains any
material harmful to minors, except that when a website contains a hypertext
link to a third-party website, the material on such third-party website shall
not be considered toward the total percentage of material if that third-party
website does not contain material harmful to minors and if such linking does
not constitute an attempt to intentionally dilute the percentage calculation of
material harmful to minors in order to evade the provisions of P.L.    , c.    
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires imposes
several requirements on entities that operate certain Internet websites and
webpages, including requiring the entity to verify the age of all State
residents that attempts to access the website or webpage and prohibiting minors
from accessing certain material that is not suitable to minors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill
provides that an entity may not allow a State resident under the age of 18
years to access an Internet website or an individual webpage that contains a
substantial portion of material harmful to minors, as defined in the bill,
unless: (1) the entity verifies the age of each resident that attempts to
access the Internet website or webpage using reasonable age verification
methods; and (2) if the resident is determined to be a minor, the material
contained on the Internet website or webpage is suitable to the minor, as determined
by the Division of Consumer Affairs (division) in the Department of law and
Public Safety.  For the purposes of this bill, substantial purpose means that
following amounts with respect to each of the following interactive computer
services: (1) for a social media platform, more than one-third of total user
accounts contain any material harmful to minors, or more than one-third of the
content on one or more users account on that platform contains material
harmful to minors; (2) for a search engine, more than one-third of the webpages
displayed in response to any user query contain any material harmful to minors,
or more than one-third of the thumbnail images displayed in response to any
user query contain any material harmful to minors; or (3) for any website or
webpage, including a search engine, more than one-third of the total content on
the website or on any individual webpage contains any material harmful to
minors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that an
entity or third party that performs the required age verification may not
retain any identifying information of the individual after access has been
granted to the material.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, an entity is
required to use reasonable age verification methods that comply with standards
and guidelines established by the division.  However, the bill provides that
the permitted age verifications methods may generally include: (1) use of a
digitized information card; (2) verification through an independent,
third-party age verification service that compares the personal information
entered by the individual who is seeking access to the material that is
available from a commercially available database, or aggregate of databases,
that is regularly used by government agencies and businesses for the purpose of
age and identity verification; or (3) any available, reasonable method that
relies on public or private transactional data to verify the age of the
individual attempting to access the material.  In developing the standards and
guidelines concerning the permitted methods of age verification, the division
may consider such factors as technological feasibility, operational
effectiveness of the age verification system, and the scale and number of users
and the primary consumer use of an interactive computer service.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under this bill, the division
would also be required to establish standards and guidelines to determine the
types of content that would be deemed material harmful to minors, as defined
in the bill.  Additionally, the division would also be required to determine
the types of content that would be deemed suitable to minors of each of the
following ages, which standards would be based on the different degrees of
material harmful that such content may have on minors of such ages: (1) minors
under the age of 10 years; (2) minors over the age of 10 years but less than 15
years; and (3) minors from the age of 15 years but less than 18 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would not apply to
any bona fide news or public interest broadcast, website video, report, or
event.  The bill also provides that interactive computer services, search
engines, and certain cloud service providers would not be deemed to violate the
provisions of this bill solely for providing access or connection to or from a
website or other information or content on the Internet, or a facility, system,
or network, unless the interactive computer service participates in a venture
with, and knowingly benefits from, an entity in violation of this bill,
regarding an entitys knowing and intentional publishing or distribution of
material harmful to minors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the division
is required to receive consumer complaints related to, investigate alleged
violation of, and enforce the provisions of this bill.  The division would be
entitled to any penalties, fines, or fees collected for a violation, which
monies would be deposited into a fund, established by this bill, to provide aid
in the investigation of cyber-crimes involving the exploitation of children. 
State law agencies may apply for monies from this fund in a manner prescribed
by the division.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Before initiating an
enforcement action, the bill requires the division to provide written notice
identifying and explaining the basis for each alleged violation to be
enforced.  Thereafter, an entity receiving notice may prevent the need for an
enforcement action by curing the violation.  If the entity does not cure a
violation, the division may initiate a civil action as provided in the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division is authorized to
impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each violation or to initiate a
civil suit in Superior Court.  A court may grant an additional $10,000 per
violation.  If the division proves a violation, the division is entitled to
reasonable attorney fees, court costs, and investigative fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill permits
an individual to bring an action in the Superior Court against an entity for
failure to comply with the provisions of this bill.  If the suit is successful,
an individual would be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  An
individual would also be entitled to up to $2,500 per instance of violation,
and if the violation resulted from a minor accessing material harmful to minors,
may include compensatory damages and damages for emotional pain and suffering,
provided  the conduct of the defendant is found to be willful, wanton, or
reckless.</p>
