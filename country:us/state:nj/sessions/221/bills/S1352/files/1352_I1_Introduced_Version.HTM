Written notification provided to a parent or legal guardian is required to be delivered by regular mail, electronic mail, or a written acknowledgement form to be delivered by the student at least two weeks prior to administration of the survey, assessment, analysis, or evaluation.  Information obtained through the survey is also required to be submitted to the Department of Education and the Department of Health and may be used to develop public health initiatives and prevention programs. This bill would amend current law to require a school district to receive written permission from a parent or legal guardian, rather than providing notification, prior to administering an anonymous, voluntary survey, assessment, analysis or evaluation to a student concerning the use of alcohol, tobacco, drugs, and vaping; sexual behavior and attitudes; behaviors that may contribute to intentional or unintentional injuries or violence; or physical activity and nutrition-related behaviors.
