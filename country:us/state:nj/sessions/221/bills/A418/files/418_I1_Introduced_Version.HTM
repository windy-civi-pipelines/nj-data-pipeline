style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>Except in
those municipalities that send out two separate property tax bills as permitted
in subsection f. of this section, each</u> tax bill shall have printed thereon
a brief tabulation showing the distribution of the amount raised by taxation in
the taxing district, in such form as to disclose the rate per $100.00 of
assessed valuation or the number of cents in each dollar paid by the taxpayer
which is to be used for the payment of State school taxes, other State taxes, county
taxes, local school expenditures, free public library taxes, and other local
expenditures.  The last named item may be further subdivided so as to show the
amount for each of the several departments of the municipal government.  In
lieu of printing such information on the tax bill, any municipality may furnish
the tabulation required hereunder and any other pertinent information in a
statement accompanying the mailing or delivery of the tax bill.</p>

homestead property tax credit pursuant to the provisions of P.L.2007, c.62
(C.18A:7F-37 et al.), the amount of the credit shall be included with the tax
calculation as a reduction in the total tax calculation for the year.  One-half

wherein a property tax reward program is operational, there shall be included
on or with the tax bill the amount of the property tax reward as a credit
against property taxes due and payable by a property owner who participates in
the program.  The property tax reward program shall be identified on the tax
bill as the source of the property tax credit.</p>

about the availability, on the Internet website of the Division of Taxation in
the Department of the Treasury, of a listing of, and eligibility requirements
for, the various State property tax relief programs.  The tax bill shall also
include the links to the Internet websites of the Department of Community
Affairs and the Division of Taxation containing this information.  The director
shall cause the amounts of said State aid and assistance that shall serve as
the basis for the calculation for each parcel to be displayed on the Internet
website of the Department of Community Affairs.  The director shall set
standards for the display of the statement on the tax bill.  </p>

concerning the credit on the face of the property tax bill or with a separate
notice, with the content and wording as the director provides.</p>

of the municipality, the tax bill may also include a statement listing the
number and type of shared services entered into by the municipality, the dollar
value of the savings to the municipality from each of those shared services,
and a total amount of municipal savings resulting from those shared services. 
The statement shall be in a format promulgated by the Director of the Division

sending one property tax bill to each taxpayer as otherwise provided in
subsection b. of this section, the governing body of a municipality may, by
resolution, authorize the tax collector to issue two separate property tax bills
to each property taxpayer within the taxing district.  One tax bill shall state
only the amount of property taxes due and payable for municipal purposes.  The
second property tax bill shall state the amount of property taxes due and
payable, after allowance any property tax deductions that are permitted by law,

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill is designated the
Transparent Tax Act of 2015.  It is intended to provide clarity to local
property taxpayers and to share the burden of assessment appeal refunds between
all local taxing districts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, sections 1 and 2
of this bill would allow municipalities, upon adoption of a resolution by the
governing body, to send to each property taxpayer two separate tax bills, one
indicating the amount due and payable for municipal purposes property taxes,
and the other indicating the amount due and payable for county purposes
property taxes, school purposes property taxes, fire district purposes property
taxes and any appropriate special district taxes, less any property tax
deductions that are permitted by law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A mortgage company making
property tax payments on behalf of a taxpayer would not be required to make
separate municipal and non-municipal tax payments to a municipality even though
the mortgage company received two separate property tax bills from a
municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Those municipalities which
choose not to send out two separate tax bills would be required to continue
sending out one tax bill that indicates the amount of tax to be paid for
municipal, county, school, fire district, and other special district purposes
as provided in R.S.54:4-65.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent
that this provision will remind municipal property taxpayers that while a
municipality, by law, is charged with the responsibility to issue property tax
bills on behalf of not only itself, but all taxing districts (county, school
district, fire district, etc.), the amount of property taxes attributable to
municipal purposes generally does not make up the largest portion of the
property tax bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sections 3 through 6 of this
bill would require county governments, school districts, fire districts and
other taxing districts to share in the burden of paying for property tax
refunds.  Under current law, only the county shares in this burden with
municipalities through the county tax equalization process.  The bill requires
the municipal tax collector to send a notice of the pro rata share of the
property tax appeal refunds paid by the municipality during the tax year to the
county, school districts and fire districts for inclusion into their annual
budgets.  In the year following the tax year in which the refunds were paid,
the municipal tax collector is then required to deduct the applicable pro rata
share of the property tax refunds from the amounts to be paid to the county and
each school district and fire district as required by N.J.S.40A:14&#8209;79,
R.S.54:4&#8209;74 and R.S.54:4&#8209;75.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is intended that this
provision will ease the burden of property assessment appeal refunds on
municipal budgets by spreading the amount of a taxpayer refund proportionately
between all taxing districts on behalf of which a municipality collects
property taxes.</p>
