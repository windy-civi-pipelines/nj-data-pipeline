STATEMENT This bill requires every business in this State that sells vehicles powered by lithium ion batteries to make certain disclosures to a purchaser regarding lithium used in the cars battery.  The statement is to be produced by the Division of Consumer Affairs and acknowledge that lithium is a raw material of increasingly scarce known reserves that must be mined or extracted.  The statement is to further provide that most extraction processes entail some form of mining to reach underground deposits of lithium-rich minerals or brines, having a significant impact on local ecosystems.  Finally, the statement is required to identify the source of the lithium used in the battery being sold. The bill also requires these businesses to affirm each purchasers receipt of the disclosure statement.  A business that violates this provision is subject to a civil penalty of $150 for a first offense and $300 for subsequent violations, collectible in a civil action by summary proceeding pursuant to the Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999, P.L.1999, c.274.
