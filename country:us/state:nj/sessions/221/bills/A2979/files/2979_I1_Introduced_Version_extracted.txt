The bill also requires the DHS to utilize the moneys available to it for the program to ensure that funding is available for:  expanding the program to each county in the State; and the expansion of a program in existence on the effective date of this bill, based on the needs of the program. Lastly, the bill requires the DHS to collect information from each EISS Program in the State.  The information would include, but not be limited to, information about the services provided by the program, the utilization of services, and the number of individuals who have been stabilized and referred to treatment in the community.  The DHS is to issue annual reports, based on the information collected, which would include a review and analysis of the programs in the State and any recommendations for improvements to the program.
