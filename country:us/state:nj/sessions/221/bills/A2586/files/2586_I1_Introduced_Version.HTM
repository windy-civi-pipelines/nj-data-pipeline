Under the bill, any development or housing that includes 10 or more dwelling units, at least one out of every 10 newly developed dwelling units would be used to meet the affordable housing obligations of a municipality in which these dwelling units are developed.  If a municipality has satisfied the total number of affordable housing units required in that municipality by the Council on Affordable Housing in the Department of Community Affairs, then there would be no additional affordable housing requirement for that municipality as required under the bill. The bill provides that for any development or housing constructed under the bill, the municipal agency reviewing such an application would make a decision on the application for the development or housing no later than 65 days after receipt of the application, except that an applicant may consent to one or more extensions of no more than an additional 65 days or may withdraw such application.

(2) in at least 50 percent of the lot area within a one-quarter-mile distance from at least one main street corridor. The bill defines Main street corridor to mean a portion of any public road, not less than one-quarter of a mile and not more than three-quarters of a mile in length that satisfies at least two of the following: (1)  encompasses an intersection of two state routes; (2)  encompasses a state route and a federal route; (3)  has at least 50 percent of the frontage along such portion being used for office, retail, service, mixed use development or general commercial purposes; and (4)  is served by public transportation. If a municipality does not have a clearly identifiable main street corridor, a municipality would permit the use of multifamily housing or at least two types of multiple dwellings through the municipal zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to section 49 of P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-62), in contiguous land encompassing an area of one-quarter square miles. Under the bill, any development or housing that includes 10 or more dwelling units, at least one out of every 10 newly developed dwelling units would be used to meet the affordable housing obligations of a municipality in which these dwelling units are developed.  If a municipality has satisfied the total number of affordable housing units required in that municipality by the Council on Affordable Housing in the Department of Community Affairs, then there would be no additional affordable housing requirement for that municipality as required under the bill. The bill provides that for any development or housing constructed under the bill, the municipal agency reviewing such an application would make a decision on the application for the development or housing no later than 65 days after receipt of the application, except that an applicant may consent to one or more extensions of no more than an additional 65 days or may withdraw such application.
