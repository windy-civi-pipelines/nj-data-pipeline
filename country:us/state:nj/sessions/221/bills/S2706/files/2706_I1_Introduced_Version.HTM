creating certain drug offenses and amending P.L.1987, c.101 and N.J.S.2C:35-10.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <b><span style='font-variant:
small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b> <i>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 1 of P.L.1987,
c.101 (C.2C:35-7) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.   Any person who
violates subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 by distributing, dispensing or
possessing with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance or
controlled substance analog while on any school property used for school
purposes which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or
school board, or within 1,000 feet of such school property or a school bus, or
while on any school bus, is guilty of a crime of the third degree and shall,
except as provided in N.J.S.2C:35-12, be sentenced by the court to a term of
imprisonment.  Where the violation involves less than one ounce of marijuana,
the term of imprisonment shall include the imposition of a minimum term which
shall be fixed at, or between, one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed,
or one year, whichever is greater, during which the defendant shall be
ineligible for parole.  In all other cases, the term of imprisonment shall
include the imposition of a minimum term which shall be fixed at, or between,
one-third and one-half of the sentence imposed, or three years, whichever is
greater, during which the defendant shall be ineligible for parole.  Notwithstanding
the provisions of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-3, a fine of up to $150,000 may
also be imposed upon any conviction for a violation of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) Notwithstanding the
provisions of N.J.S.2C:35-12 or subsection a. of this section, the court may
waive or reduce the minimum term of parole ineligibility required under
subsection a. of this section or place the defendant on probation pursuant to
paragraph (2) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:43-2.  In making this determination,
the court shall consider:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the extent of the
defendants prior criminal record and the seriousness of the offenses for which
the defendant has been convicted;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the specific location of
the present offense in relation to the school property, including distance from
the school and the reasonable likelihood of exposing children to drug-related
activities at that location;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   whether school was in
session at the time of the offense; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   whether children were
present at or in the immediate vicinity of the location when the offense took
place. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   The court shall not
waive or reduce the minimum term of </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>parole ineligibility or sentence
the defendant to probation if it finds that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the offense took place
while on any school property used for school purposes which is owned by or
leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, or while on any
school bus; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the defendant in the
course of committing the offense used or threatened violence or was in
possession of a firearm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the court at sentencing
elects not to impose a minimum term of imprisonment and parole ineligibility
pursuant to this subsection, imposes a term of parole ineligibility less than
the minimum term prescribed in subsection a. of this section, or places the
defendant on probation for a violation of subsection a. of this section, the
sentence shall not become final for 10 days in order to permit the prosecution
to appeal the courts finding and the sentence imposed.  The Attorney General
shall develop guidelines to ensure the uniform exercise of discretion in making
determinations regarding whether to appeal a decision to waive or reduce the
minimum term of parole ineligibility or place the defendant on probation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Nothing in this subsection
shall be construed to establish a basis for overcoming a presumption of
imprisonment authorized or required by subsection d. of N.J.S.2C:44-1, or a
basis for not imposing a term of imprisonment or term of parole ineligibility
authorized or required to be imposed pursuant to subsection f. of N.J.S.2C:43-6
or upon conviction for a crime other than the offense set forth in this
subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Notwithstanding the
provisions of N.J.S.2C:1-8 or any other provisions of law, a conviction arising
under this section shall not merge with a conviction for a violation of
subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:35-5 (manufacturing, distributing or dispensing) or
N.J.S.2C:35-6 (employing a juvenile in a drug distribution scheme).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It shall be no defense
to a prosecution for a violation of this section that the actor was unaware
that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any
school property.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under this
section, or under any other provision of this title, that no juveniles were
present on the school property at the time of the offense or that the school
was not in session.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     It is an affirmative
defense to prosecution for a violation of this section that the prohibited
conduct took place entirely within a private residence, that no person 17 years
of age or younger was present in such private residence at any time during the
commission of the offense, and that the prohibited conduct did not involve
distributing, dispensing or possessing with the intent to distribute or
dispense any controlled dangerous substance or controlled substance analog for
profit.  The affirmative defense established in this section shall be proved by
the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence.  Nothing herein shall be
construed to establish an affirmative defense with respect to a prosecution for
an offense defined in any other section of this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In a prosecution under
this section, a map produced or reproduced by any municipal or county engineer
for the purpose of depicting the location and boundaries of the area on or
within 1,000 feet of any property used for school purposes which is owned by or
