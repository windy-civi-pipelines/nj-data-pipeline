A prosecutor seeking waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority without the consent of the juvenile shall file a motion within 60 days after the receipt of the complaint, which time may be extended for good cause shown.  The motion shall be accompanied by a written statement of reasons clearly setting forth the facts used in assessing all factors contained in paragraph (3) of subsection c. of this section, together with an explanation as to how evaluation of those facts support waiver for each particular juvenile. b.    At a hearing, the court shall receive the evidence offered by the State and by the juvenile.  The State shall provide proof to satisfy the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection c. of this section. The court also shall review whether the State considered the factors set forth in paragraph (3) of subsection c. of this section. c.     Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the court shall waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case without the juvenile's consent and shall refer the case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if: (1)   The juvenile was 15 years of age or older at the time of the alleged delinquent act; and (2)   There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which if committed by an adult would constitute: (a)   criminal homicide, other than death by auto; (b)   strict liability for drug-induced deaths; (c)   first degree robbery; (d)   carjacking; (e)   aggravated sexual assault; (f)   sexual assault; (g)   second degree aggravated assault; (h)   kidnapping; (i)    aggravated arson; (j)    possession of a firearm with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person of another under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4, or possession of a firearm while committing or attempting to commit, including the immediate flight therefrom, aggravated assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, burglary, home invasion burglary, residential burglary, or escape; (k)   a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-3 (Leader of a Narcotics Trafficking Network); (l)    a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-4 (Maintaining and Operating a CDS Production Facility); (m)  a violation of section 1 of P.L.1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1) (Weapons Possession while Committing certain CDS Offenses); (n)   an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the crimes enumerated in subparagraphs (a) through (m) of this paragraph; or (o)   a crime committed at a time when the juvenile previously had been sentenced and confined in an adult correctional facility. (3)   The court may deny a motion by the prosecutor to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case if it is clearly convinced that the prosecutor abused his discretion in considering the following factors in deciding whether to seek a waiver: (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense charged; (b)   Whether the offense was against a person or property, allocating more weight for crimes against the person; (c)   Degree of the juvenile's culpability; (d)   Age and maturity of the juvenile; (e)   Any classification that the juvenile is eligible for special education to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; (f)   Degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the juvenile; (g)   Nature and extent of any prior history of delinquency of the juvenile and dispositions imposed for those adjudications; (h)   If the juvenile previously served a custodial disposition in a State juvenile facility operated by the Juvenile Justice Commission, and the response of the juvenile to the programs provided at the facility to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the Juvenile Justice Commission; (i)    Current or prior involvement of the juvenile with child welfare agencies; (j)    Evidence of mental health concerns, substance use disorder, or emotional instability of the juvenile to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; and (k)   If there is an identifiable victim, the input of the victim or victim's family.

(1) The Juvenile Justice Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall establish a program to collect, record, and analyze data regarding waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority.  In furtherance of this program, the Juvenile Justice Commission shall, in cooperation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Attorney General, and county prosecutors, collect data related to the decision to seek waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case, which shall include but not be limited to data concerning: (a)   youth demographics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity; (b)   case characteristics, including the degree of the offense waived, the degree of the offense convicted, and the final court resolution; (c)   case processing times; and (d)   waiver rates by race and ethnicity.

STATEMENT This bill creates This bill creates the second degree crime of home invasion burglary, subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), and the third degree crime of residential burglary, which would not be subject to the NERA. Additionally, it allows for the waiver of juveniles to adult criminal court for crimes related to the burglary of residential dwellings and clarifies statutory definitions. Specifically, under the provisions of this bill, a person commits the crime of home invasion burglary if the person enters or remains surreptitiously in a residential dwelling without license or permission to do so and: 1) purposely, knowingly, or recklessly inflicts bodily injury on anyone; 2) attempts to inflict or threatens to inflict bodily injury on anyone; or 3) is armed with or displays what appear to be explosives or a deadly weapon. As a second degree crime, home invasion burglary would be penalized by a mandatory term of imprisonment between five to 10 years. Additionally, the convicted offender would be required to serve 85 percent of the sentence imposed, without the possibility of parole since the bill includes the crime of home invasion burglary under the NERA. A convicted offender could also be subject to a fine of up to $150,000 (the ordinary fine amount applicable to second degree crimes). Under the provisions of this bill, a person commits the crime of residential burglary if the person enters or remains surreptitiously in a residential dwelling without a license or permission to do so.  As a third degree crime, the term of imprisonment for a residential burglary is between three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. In addition, this bill provides for the waiver of a juvenile to adult criminal court if a home invasion burglary or residential burglary is committed while the juvenile is in possession of a firearm.  The bill also clarifies the definition of residential dwelling and the statutory definition of burglary. The provisions of this bill provide that a person who is at least 18 years old and has a prior conviction for a home invasion burglary in which the person used or possessed a firearm during the commission of the crime would be subject to an extended term of imprisonment. Additionally, under the provisions of this bill, a person convicted of a home invasion burglary or a residential burglary who, in the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, used or was in possession of a stolen vehicle, would be subject to an extended term of imprisonment. Finally, this bill would require a person applying for certain employment opportunities to file a disclosure statement stating whether or not the applicant has been convicted of home invasion burglary or residential burglary.

The court also shall review whether the State considered the factors set forth in paragraph (3) of subsection c. of this section. c.     Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the court shall waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case without the juvenile's consent and shall refer the case to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if: (1)   The juvenile was 15 years of age or older at the time of the alleged delinquent act; and (2)   There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act which if committed by an adult would constitute: (a)   criminal homicide, other than death by auto; (b)   strict liability for drug-induced deaths; (c)   first degree robbery; (d)   carjacking; (e)   aggravated sexual assault; (f)   sexual assault; (g)   second degree aggravated assault; (h)   kidnapping; (i)    aggravated arson; (j)    possession of a firearm with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person of another under subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:39-4, or possession of a firearm while committing or attempting to commit, including the immediate flight therefrom, aggravated assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, burglary, home invasion burglary, residential burglary, or escape; (k)   a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-3 (Leader of a Narcotics Trafficking Network); (l)    a violation of N.J.S.2C:35-4 (Maintaining and Operating a CDS Production Facility); (m)  a violation of section 1 of P.L.1998, c.26 (C.2C:39-4.1) (Weapons Possession while Committing certain CDS Offenses); (n)   an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the crimes enumerated in subparagraphs (a) through (m) of this paragraph; or (o)   a crime committed at a time when the juvenile previously had been sentenced and confined in an adult correctional facility. (3)   The court may deny a motion by the prosecutor to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case if it is clearly convinced that the prosecutor abused his discretion in considering the following factors in deciding whether to seek a waiver: (a)   The nature and circumstances of the offense charged; (b)   Whether the offense was against a person or property, allocating more weight for crimes against the person; (c)   Degree of the juvenile's culpability; (d)   Age and maturity of the juvenile; (e)   Any classification that the juvenile is eligible for special education to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; (f)   Degree of criminal sophistication exhibited by the juvenile; (g)   Nature and extent of any prior history of delinquency of the juvenile and dispositions imposed for those adjudications; (h)   If the juvenile previously served a custodial disposition in a State juvenile facility operated by the Juvenile Justice Commission, and the response of the juvenile to the programs provided at the facility to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the Juvenile Justice Commission; (i)    Current or prior involvement of the juvenile with child welfare agencies; (j)    Evidence of mental health concerns, substance use disorder, or emotional instability of the juvenile to the extent this information is provided to the prosecution by the juvenile or by the court; and (k)   If there is an identifiable victim, the input of the victim or victim's family.

(1) The Juvenile Justice Commission, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall establish a program to collect, record, and analyze data regarding waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case by the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority.  In furtherance of this program, the Juvenile Justice Commission shall, in cooperation with the Administrative Office of the Courts, Attorney General, and county prosecutors, collect data related to the decision to seek waiver of jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case, which shall include but not be limited to data concerning: (a)   youth demographics, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity; (b)   case characteristics, including the degree of the offense waived, the degree of the offense convicted, and the final court resolution; (c)   case processing times; and (d)   waiver rates by race and ethnicity. (2)   The commission shall prepare and publish on its Internet website biennial reports summarizing the data collected, recorded, and analyzed pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. (3)   The commission shall, pursuant to section 2 of P.L. 1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), biennially prepare and transmit to the Governor and the Legislature the reports required in paragraph (2) of this subsection, along with any recommendations the commission may have for legislation concerning waiver of jurisdiction of juvenile delinquency cases.

STATEMENT This bill creates This bill creates the second degree crime of home invasion burglary, subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA), and the third degree crime of residential burglary, which would not be subject to the NERA. Additionally, it allows for the waiver of juveniles to adult criminal court for crimes related to the burglary of residential dwellings and clarifies statutory definitions. Specifically, under the provisions of this bill, a person commits the crime of home invasion burglary if the person enters or remains surreptitiously in a residential dwelling without license or permission to do so and: 1) purposely, knowingly, or recklessly inflicts bodily injury on anyone; 2) attempts to inflict or threatens to inflict bodily injury on anyone; or 3) is armed with or displays what appear to be explosives or a deadly weapon. As a second degree crime, home invasion burglary would be penalized by a mandatory term of imprisonment between five to 10 years. Additionally, the convicted offender would be required to serve 85 percent of the sentence imposed, without the possibility of parole since the bill includes the crime of home invasion burglary under the NERA. A convicted offender could also be subject to a fine of up to $150,000 (the ordinary fine amount applicable to second degree crimes). Under the provisions of this bill, a person commits the crime of residential burglary if the person enters or remains surreptitiously in a residential dwelling without a license or permission to do so.  As a third degree crime, the term of imprisonment for a residential burglary is between three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both. In addition, this bill provides for the waiver of a juvenile to adult criminal court if a home invasion burglary or residential burglary is committed while the juvenile is in possession of a firearm.  The bill also clarifies the definition of residential dwelling and the statutory definition of burglary. The provisions of this bill provide that a person who is at least 18 years old and has a prior conviction for a home invasion burglary in which the person used or possessed a firearm during the commission of the crime would be subject to an extended term of imprisonment. Additionally, under the provisions of this bill, a person convicted of a home invasion burglary or a residential burglary who, in the course of committing or attempting to commit the crime, used or was in possession of a stolen vehicle, would be subject to an extended term of imprisonment. Finally, this bill would require a person applying for certain employment opportunities to file a disclosure statement stating whether or not the applicant has been convicted of home invasion burglary or residential burglary.
