Prior to taking any adverse action against a person, the director or the director's designee shall convene a hearing, upon due notice, affording the person an opportunity to be heard.  If the qualified purchasing agent certificate held by a person serving as a purchasing agent is revoked, the director shall order that person to no longer perform the duties of purchasing agent, and the person shall not be eligible to serve as a purchasing agent or to make application for recertification for a period of five years from the date of revocation. i.     The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of P.L.1971, c.198.  Notwithstanding any provision of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, any such regulations shall be effective immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law and shall be effective for a period not to exceed 365 days and may thereafter be amended, adopted or readopted by the director in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410. In order to better manage the workload of implementing the provisions of P.L.1971, c.198, the director may establish a transition process for administering an examination for individuals serving as purchasing agents on the effective date of P.L.1971, c.198, issuing and renewing qualified purchasing agent certificates to eligible individuals, prescribing a schedule by which such certificates will be issued and renewed, and such other matters as the director determines to be necessary to the implementation of P.L.1971, c.198. (cf: P.L.2015, c.95, s.45) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would allow a contracting unit under the Local Public Contracts Law, P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), to designate its municipal finance officer, county finance officer, or county purchasing official to serve as a purchasing agent only if the person is a certified municipal finance officer, a certified county finance officer, or a certified county purchasing official, and the person will perform the actual day to day work of a purchasing agent. The bill also provides that the work experience required for certification as a qualified purchasing agent must be performed under the direct supervision of a purchasing agent, or, in the case of a certified municipal finance officer, certified county finance officer, or certified county purchasing official, two years of full-time governmental experience performing duties relative to those of public procurement. Additionally, the bill would specify the content and length of the courses an individual must complete to earn a qualified purchasing agent certificate. Under the Local Public Contracts Law, a contracting unit that designates a holder of a qualified purchasing agent certificate as its purchasing agent may award contracts without public advertising at a higher threshold amount than a contracting unit that designates as its purchasing agent a person who does not hold a qualified purchasing agent certificate.
