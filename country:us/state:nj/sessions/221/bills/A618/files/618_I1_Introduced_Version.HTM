individual holding a qualified purchasing agent certificate allows the
certificate to lapse by failing to renew the certificate, the individual shall
be required to apply to take the qualifying examination required pursuant to

except that such application may be made in the same manner as a renewal within
12 months of the expiration of the certificate if the director determines that

heard.  If the qualified purchasing agent certificate held by a person serving
as a purchasing agent is revoked, the director shall order that person to no
longer perform the duties of purchasing agent, and the person shall not be
eligible to serve as a purchasing agent or to make application for
recertification for a period of five years from the date of revocation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The director may adopt
and promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of P.L.1971,

administering an examination for individuals serving as purchasing agents on
the effective date of P.L.1971, c.198, issuing and renewing qualified

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would allow a
contracting unit under the Local Public Contracts Law, P.L.1971, c.198
(C.40A:11-1 et seq.), to designate its municipal finance officer, county
finance officer, or county purchasing official to serve as a purchasing agent
only if the person is a certified municipal finance officer, a certified county
finance officer, or a certified county purchasing official, and the person will
perform the actual day to day work of a purchasing agent. The bill also
provides that the work experience required for certification as a qualified
purchasing agent must be performed under the direct supervision of a purchasing
agent, or, in the case of a certified municipal finance officer, certified
county finance officer, or certified county purchasing official, two years of
full-time governmental experience performing duties relative to those of public
procurement. Additionally, the bill would specify the content and length of the
courses an individual must complete to earn a qualified purchasing agent
certificate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the Local Public
Contracts Law, a contracting unit that designates a holder of a qualified
purchasing agent certificate as its purchasing agent may award contracts
without public advertising at a higher threshold amount than a contracting unit
that designates as its purchasing agent a person who does not hold a qualified
purchasing agent certificate.</p>
