prior to it being fully operative but a set time in which to promulgate the rules
and regulations is updated to align with the effective date of the substitute,
which is to be fully operative on the first day of the twenty-fifth month after
the date of enactment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Added as part of the boards
responsibilities is the requirement that if a license of a contractor at any
level  principal, limited, or regular home improvement or home elevation  is
not renewed or is suspended or revoked, the board is to notify the Division of
Consumer Affairs so that the division is aware and ensures that the individual
with the encumbered license does not impact the registration of the business
that employs the individual.  Moreover, the board is to establish standards for
the scopes of practice for each type of licensee it oversees and for the supervision
of licensees, except for those at the principal level.  Additionally, the board
is to develop curriculum for or to identify courses in which an applicant can
enroll to prepare for examinations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, licensure as
either a home improvement or home elevation contractor can be achieved through
completion of an apprenticeship or through experience.  If applying through the
experience option, an individual is to perform services subject to the direct
oversight of a contractor, include the name of the home improvement or home
elevations business for whom the individual worked on the application, and is
to attest, as part of the application, that, when performing contracting
services, industry best practices where adhered to and standard procedures were
followed in a safe and healthy manner.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill stipulates that
individuals, including limited specialty services licensees, are subject to
fines if it is determined that an individual made false statements in
connection with the process to obtain licensure.  It is also prohibited in the bill
to falsely advertise, including through electronic media, regarding
qualifications of an individual to provide contracting services.  Additionally,
the bill specifies individuals exempt from licensure.  The exemption includes
individuals who provide home improvement services but earn a maximum of $1,500
per contract and $25,000 annually.  An individual exempted under these maximum
amounts is to still subject to the requirement to maintain annual registration,
to be handled by the Division of Consumer Affairs rather than the board. 
However, a party exempted pursuant to these maximum dollar amounts will be
required to obtain licensure by the board if, at the time of annual
registration renewal, the earnings of the individual demonstrate that the
dollar amounts increased in the previous calendar year.  The bill  also
requires the board to establish the process by which a limited specialty
services licensee can obtain full licensure as a home improvement or home elevation
contractor.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill preserves and
updates most provisions in current law that govern the registration
requirements and process for contractors businesses.  It also stipulates that
a contractor business is to employ at least one licensed contractor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill updates language on
the oversight of home improvement and home elevation businesses by the Division
of Consumer Affairs.  Language is added throughout the current law to ensure
that its provisions apply to the contractors businesses.  This includes
incorporating the provisions requiring general liability insurance, workers
compensation insurance, and either a bond, letter of credit, or other type of
security.  Language is also added to require certain contracts for home
improvement services to include the name and license number of the contractor
providing the services and the registration number of the business for which
the contractor provides services.  Additionally, the division is to notify the
board when a contractor business has its registration suspended, revoked or not
renewed.   </p>
