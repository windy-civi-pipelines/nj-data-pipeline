(d)   Abatement authority. The director, on his own motion, may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment of income tax, or any liability in respect thereof, if the director determines under uniform rules prescribed by him that the administration and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due.  He may also abate, on his own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in respect thereof, which is excessive in amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed.  No claim for abatement under this subsection shall be filed by a taxpayer. (e)   The Department of the Treasury, Division of Taxation, may enter into an agreement with the taxing authorities of any state which imposes a tax on or is measured by income to provide that compensation paid in such state to residents of this State shall be exempt from such tax; in such case any compensation paid in this State to residents of such state shall be exempt from New Jersey personal income tax. The Division, in such agreements, may provide for reciprocal withholding, employer liability, exchange of information and all other matters relating to cooperation between the states.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, any agreement heretofore or hereinafter entered into, notwithstanding the terms thereof concerning termination of the agreement, shall not be terminated unless the termination thereof is by enactment of a law directing the director to terminate the agreement. (cf: N.J.S.54A:9-17) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and shall be retroactive to October 19, 1977. STATEMENT This bill requires that the authority of the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to enter into reciprocal personal income tax agreements with other states is to be limited by restricting the termination of any such agreement to the enactment by the Legislature and the Governor of a law directing the termination of an agreement. This bill is retroactive to October 19, 1977, the effective date of the Reciprocal Personal Income Tax Agreement between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of New Jersey.
