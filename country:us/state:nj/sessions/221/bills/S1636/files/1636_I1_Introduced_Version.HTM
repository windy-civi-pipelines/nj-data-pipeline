of the commissioner or the municipal clerk; or (3) by completing and submitting
a change of residence notice online as provided by the Secretary of State.  <u>Change
of residence information shall also be received from the Motor Vehicle
Commission and processed pursuant to subsection d. of section 24 of P.L.1994,
c.182 (C.39:2-3.2).</u>  The commissioner shall provide change of residence
notices in card form for the use of any registered voter moving to another
address within the same election district; to another election district within
the same county; or to another election district in another county for
processing as provided under subsection c. of this section.  Copies of these
notices shall also be available at the office of the municipal clerk in each
municipality.  Each municipal clerk shall transmit daily to the commissioner
all the filled out change of residence notices that may be in the municipal
clerk's office at the time.  These notices shall be printed upon cards, shall
contain a blank form showing where the applicant last resided and the address
and exact location to which the applicant has moved and shall have a line for
the applicant's signature, printed name and date of birth.  Upon receipt of
such change of residence notice the commissioner shall cause the signature to
be compared with the registration forms of the applicant and, if such signature
appears to be of and by one and the same legal voter, the commissioner shall
cause the entry of the change of residence to be made on those registration
forms and the registrant shall thereupon be qualified to vote in the election
district to which the registrant shall have so moved.  If the commissioner is
not satisfied as to the signature on the request for a change of residence, a
confirmation notice as prescribed by subsection d. of R.S.19:31-15 shall be
sent by mail with postage prepaid to the registrant at the new address.</p>

may be, on or before the 21st day preceding any election.</p>

having made application for change of residence, or who has not returned a
confirmation notice sent to the voter by the commissioner of registration of
the county, if such a notice has been sent to the voter, or who has not moved
since the previous election but whose registration information is missing or
otherwise deficient, or has otherwise failed to notify the commissioner of
registration of the voter's change of address within the county, shall be
permitted to vote in that election in the district to which the voter has
moved, upon making a written affirmation regarding the change of address at the
polling place of the district in which the voter resides on the day of the election. 
No identifying document shall be required from the voter for this affirmation. 
A district board member shall provide the voter with a provisional ballot, and
an envelope with an affirmation statement that conforms with the requirements
for such documents contained in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L.1999, c.232
(C.19:53C-1).  The voter shall complete the provisional ballot and affirmation
statement, place the ballot in the envelope, seal and return it to the district
board member.  The board member shall review the information in the affirmation
statement for completeness before forwarding it for inspection, tabulation and
notation by the county board of elections, as provided for by sections 7
through 26 of P.L.1999, c.232 (C.19:53C-1 through C.19:53C-20).  The
affirmation statement shall constitute a transfer to the registrant's new
residence for any subsequent election.  However, if the voter has moved from
one residence to another within the same election district at any time, the
voter shall be permitted to vote in such election district at any election in
the same manner as other voters at the polling place upon written affirmation
by the registrant to the district board member of the registrant's change of
address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A voter who moves from
an election district in one county to an election district in another county
prior to the close of registration preceding an election shall register in the
new county of residence, in accordance with the provisions of R.S.19:31-6, or
shall file a change of residence notice with the commissioner of either county
or complete and submit that notice online as provided by the Secretary of
State, <u>or have their registration updated pursuant to subsection d. of
section 24 of P.L.1994, c.182 (C.39:2-3.2),</u> in order to be permitted to
vote.  A change of residence notice filed by a voter pursuant to this
subsection shall cause the commissioners of the county of previous residence
and the county of new residence to update the voter registration record of that
voter.  The commissioner of the county of new residence shall notify the voter
by mail that the voter is now registered to vote in that county or, if the
notice submitted by the voter is incomplete, to request any additional
information or documentation necessary to finalize the change of residence
notice.  Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to waive the
requirement specified under R.S.19:31-5 that the voter shall have been a
resident of the county of new residence for at least 30 days prior to being eligible
to vote in any election in that county.</p>

Vehicle Commission voter registration procedures. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 1 of the bill changes
eligibility to be able to vote in an election to when the voter has registered
to vote with the MVC, not when they have simply completed the form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 2 of the bill allows
transfer of information on a newly registered voter received electronically by
the MVC into the Statewide voter registration system. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 3 of the bill directs
the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services and the Department of
Corrections to automatically transmit voter registration information to the
Secretary of State for each person who applies to the New Jersey Medical
Assistance and Health Services Program who is eligible to vote.  The
information received by the Secretary of State from the division and department
does not require a digitized image of the applicants signature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 4 of the bill changes
to residence information are permitted to be received, processed, and updated
by the MVC in addition to the commissioner, municipal clerk, or the Secretary
of State for voter registration purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 5 of the bill changes
to name information are permitted to be received and processed by the MVC for
voter registration purposes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6 of the bill directs
the MVC to automatically transfer information to the Secretary of State about
each person, except those in the Address Confidentiality Program, who
approaches the MVC for a motor vehicle drivers license or similar license who
is not registered to vote, is of age, and is a citizen.  If the person is
determined to be eligible to vote by the Secretary of State, the secretary will
transmit the information to the appropriate county commissioner of registration
who will register the person to vote and send a notice to the person by mail
confirming the registration.  The notice will include a form with prepaid
postage by which the person may declare a political party affiliation, request
mail-in ballots until indicated otherwise, or decline to be registered to vote.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6 also requires that the
notice will include the required information in English and Spanish, as well
any additional language which is the primary language of five percent or more
of the registered voters in the county where the notice is mailed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6 also removes the
requirement that voter registration information from an application received
online for the renewal of a motor vehicle driver's license or non-driver
identification card will be collected and transmitted electronically to the
Secretary of State upon the implementation by the Secretary of State of online
voter registration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Section 6 also directs the MVC
to transmit to the Secretary of State the applicants name and address for
every application for a motor vehicle drivers license, or similar license, and
each related update, renewal, or change of address, by an applicant who is
already registered to vote in the State of New Jersey for the purpose of
maintaining current information on the applicant.  If the Secretary of State finds
that the name or address provided by the MVC is different than the name or
address on the voters registration record, the secretary will transmit the
updated name or address to the appropriate county commissioner of registration. 
A notice of the change and a postage paid preaddressed return form by which the
person may verify or correct the information will be sent to the person.  If
the person returns the notice and indicates that the change to the persons
registration record was an error, the appropriate county commissioner of registration
will immediately correct the persons previously updated information in the
statewide voter registration system. </p>
