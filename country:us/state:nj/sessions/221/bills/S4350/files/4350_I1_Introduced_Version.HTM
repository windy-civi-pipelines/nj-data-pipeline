The bill would require the trust to designate areas of the State as urban areas based on population density, residential and commercial development, and non-residential land uses, among other factors, in a specific region, and to adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement the bills provisions. In addition, the bill would establish funding allocations for the constitutional dedication of Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenues for fiscal year 2026 and thereafter.  Under the bill, on July 1 next following the bills effective date, $25 million of the amount credited to the Preserve New Jersey Fund Account pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund, established pursuant to the bill.  In addition, in each State fiscal year commencing in State fiscal year 2026 and annually thereafter, of the amount credited by the State Treasurer to the Preserve New Jersey Fund Account pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.): (1) 62 percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund; (2) 26 percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund; (3) seven percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Historic Preservation Fund; and (4) five percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund. The bill would also require the trust to establish and administer the Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Stewardship Grant Program (grant program) for the purpose of providing grants to qualified applicants for stewardship activity projects, including, but not limited to, projects that improve soil health, climate resiliency, and erosion and sediment control, on land that has been acquired by the trust and preserved for agricultural and horticultural purposes pursuant to the bill.  Section 6 of the bill establishes certain eligibility criteria and application requirements for qualified applicants applying for a grant under the grant program.  The trust would be required to approve applications for the grant program on a rolling basis subject to the availability of funds in the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund.  Upon the approval of an application, the trust would be required to provide a grant, in an amount not to exceed ninety percent of the total estimated costs of the stewardship activity project, to the qualified applicant. The bill would authorize the trust to utilize moneys in the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund for: (1) the fee simple acquisition or lesser interests in land, including, but not limited to, a development easement, a conservation restriction or easement, or any other restriction or easement permanently restricting development, by purchase or installment purchase agreement of land in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes; (2) providing grants under the grant program; and (3) paying certain administrative costs.  Of the monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund, not more than fifteen percent can be utilized by the trust for organizational, administrative and other work and services, including salaries, equipment, and materials necessary to administer the bills provisions. Finally, the bill would allow counties and municipalities to utilize open space trust funds for the additional purpose of acquiring lands in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes.  Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds. This bill would expand this authorization to specifically include the acquisition and stewardship of lands in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes and would revise the names of these open space trust funds to include urban agriculture and horticulture.

(cf: P.L.2011, c.173, s.7) 16.  Section 8 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.8) is amended to read as follows: 8.    Any municipality whose voters, prior to the effective date of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.1 et seq.), approved pursuant to R.S.40:12-10 et seq. a proposition authorizing the establishment, maintenance, and improvement of a system of public recreation shall be deemed to have approved a proposition for any or all of the purposes specified in paragraph (1) of subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.7) at the amount or rate specified in the original proposition, which purposes shall be determined by adoption of an ordinance by the governing body of the municipality after conducting at least one public hearing thereon. Any fund created for the purposes of R.S.40:12-10 et seq. shall be dissolved and any monies remaining therein shall be deposited into the "Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, Urban Agriculture and Horticulture, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Fund" created pursuant to subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.7) to be utilized for the purposes determined by the governing body of the municipality as authorized pursuant to this section. (cf: P.L.2011, c.173, s.8) 17.  Section 9 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.9) is amended to read as follows: 9.    Lands acquired by a municipality using revenue raised pursuant to P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.1 et seq.) shall be held in trust and shall be used exclusively for the purposes authorized under P.L.1997, c.24. After conducting at least one public hearing thereon and upon a finding that the purposes of P.L.1997, c.24 might otherwise be better served or that any land acquired by a municipality pursuant thereto is required for another public use, which finding shall be set forth in an ordinance adopted by the governing body of the municipality, the governing body may convey, through sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition, title to, or a lesser interest in, that land, provided that the governing body shall replace any land conveyed under this section by land of at least equal fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness, size, quality, and location to the land conveyed, and any monies derived from the conveyance shall be deposited into the "Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, Urban Agriculture and Horticulture, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Fund" created pursuant to subsection c. of section 7 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.7) for use for the purposes authorized by P.L.1997, c.24 for monies in the municipal trust fund.  Any such conveyance shall be made in accordance with the "Local Lands and Buildings Law," P.L.1971, c.199 (C.40A:12-1 et seq.).  In the event of conveyance by exchange, the land or improvements thereon to be transferred to the trust shall be at least equal in fair market value and of reasonably equivalent usefulness, size, quality, and location to the land or improvements transferred from the trust. (cf: P.L.2011, c.173, s.9) 18.  Section 7 of P.L.1992, c.157 (C.40:12-16.1) is amended to read as follows: 7.    The county agriculture development board of a county in which the voters of the county have approved, in a general or special election, a proposition authorizing the acquisition of lands for farmland preservation purposes pursuant to P.L.1989, c.30 (C.40:12-16 et seq.) or P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.1 et seq. ) shall, pursuant to the provisions of section 24 of P.L.1983, c.32 (C.4:1C-31), adopt a prioritized list of farmland eligible for acquisition of development easements thereon by installment purchase agreements pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1992, c.157 (C.40:12-16.1 et al.) if the county intends to acquire development easements on farmland in that manner.  The governing body of the county shall annually appropriate from the "County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, Urban Agriculture and Horticulture, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Fund" created pursuant to subsection c. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.24 (C.40:12-15.2) such amounts as it may deem necessary to finance the acquisition of development easements on farmland within that county by installment purchase agreement. (cf: P.L.2011, c.173, s.10) 19.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would authorize the Garden State Preservation Trust (trust) to develop a program to acquire land for agricultural or horticultural purposes in urban areas of the State through the purchase of fee simple titles or lesser interests in land, including, but not limited to, a development easement, a conservation restriction or easement, or any other restriction or easement permanently restricting development, by purchase or installment purchase agreement using constitutionally dedicated moneys. The bill would require the trust to develop eligibility criteria for the acquisition of land in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes and an application process for landowners to apply to the trust to sell a fee simple title or a lesser interest in land.  The trust would be required to prioritize the purchase of small parcels of land in urban areas of the State that are suitable for agricultural or horticultural purposes. Under the bill, any land acquired in fee simple by the trust would be required to be held of record in the name of the State and may be offered for lease by the State using a competitive bidding process to interested parties, provided that the land is to be utilized for agricultural or horticultural purposes.  The trust would be required to establish an application process for the lease of land acquired by the trust, which would require applicants to provide information concerning the intended use of the land for agricultural or horticultural purposes.  The terms of the lease are to be established by the trust. The bill would require the trust to designate areas of the State as urban areas based on population density, residential and commercial development, and non-residential land uses, among other factors, in a specific region, and to adopt rules and regulations as necessary to implement the bills provisions. In addition, the bill would establish funding allocations for the constitutional dedication of Corporation Business Tax (CBT) revenues for fiscal year 2026 and thereafter.  Under the bill, on July 1 next following the bills effective date, $25 million of the amount credited to the Preserve New Jersey Fund Account pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.) would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund, established pursuant to the bill.  In addition, in each State fiscal year commencing in State fiscal year 2026 and annually thereafter, of the amount credited by the State Treasurer to the Preserve New Jersey Fund Account pursuant to the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.): (1) 62 percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Green Acres Fund; (2) 26 percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Farmland Preservation Fund; (3) seven percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Historic Preservation Fund; and (4) five percent would be required to be deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund. The bill would also require the trust to establish and administer the Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Stewardship Grant Program (grant program) for the purpose of providing grants to qualified applicants for stewardship activity projects, including, but not limited to, projects that improve soil health, climate resiliency, and erosion and sediment control, on land that has been acquired by the trust and preserved for agricultural and horticultural purposes pursuant to the bill.  Section 6 of the bill establishes certain eligibility criteria and application requirements for qualified applicants applying for a grant under the grant program.  The trust would be required to approve applications for the grant program on a rolling basis subject to the availability of funds in the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund.  Upon the approval of an application, the trust would be required to provide a grant, in an amount not to exceed ninety percent of the total estimated costs of the stewardship activity project, to the qualified applicant. The bill would authorize the trust to utilize moneys in the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund for: (1) the fee simple acquisition or lesser interests in land, including, but not limited to, a development easement, a conservation restriction or easement, or any other restriction or easement permanently restricting development, by purchase or installment purchase agreement of land in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes; (2) providing grants under the grant program; and (3) paying certain administrative costs.  Of the monies deposited into the Preserve New Jersey Urban Agriculture and Horticulture Fund, not more than fifteen percent can be utilized by the trust for organizational, administrative and other work and services, including salaries, equipment, and materials necessary to administer the bills provisions. Finally, the bill would allow counties and municipalities to utilize open space trust funds for the additional purpose of acquiring lands in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes.  Under current law, counties are authorized to establish County Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds and municipalities are authorized to establish Municipal Open Space, Recreation, Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Trust Funds. This bill would expand this authorization to specifically include the acquisition and stewardship of lands in urban areas of the State for agricultural or horticultural purposes and would revise the names of these open space trust funds to include urban agriculture and horticulture.
