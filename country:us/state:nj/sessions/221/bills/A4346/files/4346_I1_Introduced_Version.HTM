on himself, or who is the beneficiary of a person's annuity contract or life
insurance policy, is found to be a child support judgment debtor, a lien shall
be placed on the proceeds of the contract or policy at the time the proceeds
become available for the use of the person's estate or beneficiary.  The lien
would stay the distribution of the proceeds of the annuity contract or life
insurance policy to the estate or beneficiary until the child support judgment

contract or life settlement are also subject to the provisions of the bill.</p>

support judgment debtor.  The bill would provide that reasonable funeral
expenses are not included as net proceeds.  The $2,000 threshold would not
apply to the proceeds of an annuity contract or life insurance policy; the
child support lien would attach regardless of the amount of the proceeds.</p>

bill, prior to the distribution of any of the proceeds of the annuity contract

beneficiary would be required to provide the insurance company responsible for
issuing the contract or policy with a certification that includes the insured's
and his beneficiary's name, mailing address, date of birth and social security
number.  The insurance company would then initiate a child support judgment
search using a private judgment search company.  The search would be used to
determine whether the person or the person's beneficiary is a child support
judgment debtor.  This judgment search would not be required if a prevailing
party or a beneficiary is a minor child under the age of 16, except in the case
of the distribution of the proceeds of an annuity contract or life insurance
policy.  A fee of not more than $10 for each name of a child support judgment
debtor searched would be permitted.  This fee would be chargeable against the
proceeds of the annuity contract or life insurance policy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, pre-paid
funeral policies, credit life insurance policies and payment of reasonable
funeral expenses are exempt from the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The judgment search company
would provide a certification to the insurance company responsible for issuing
the annuity contract or life insurance policy identifying whether the insured
or his beneficiary is a child support judgment debtor.  If a child support
judgment is not found, the proceeds of the annuity contract or life insurance
policy may be distributed to the insured's estate or beneficiary immediately. 
If a child support judgment against the insured or his beneficiary is found, in
a case monitored by the Probation Division of the Superior Court, the insurance
company would be required to contact the Probation Division and arrange for the
satisfaction of the judgment prior to the disbursement of any funds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also limit the
liability of an insurance company when satisfying a judgment from the proceeds
of an annuity contract or a life insurance policy.  In addition, the bill
prohibits a private judgment search company from using any information provided
by an insurance company for purposes other than determining if the insured or
his beneficiary is the debtor of a child support judgment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also amend
N.J.S.17B:24-6, N.J.S.17B:24-7, and N.J.S.17B:24-9 to clarify that the proceeds
of an annuity contract and of individual and group life insurance are subject
to a child support lien.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Commissioner of Banking and
