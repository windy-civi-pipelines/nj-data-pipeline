<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill prohibits
incarcerated individuals from receiving public benefits from Medicaid, Work
First New Jersey, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In general, current law
prohibits incarcerated individuals from receiving benefits under these
programs, but due to a lack of information sharing between relevant government
agencies, inappropriate payments sometimes occur.  In order to reduce these
inappropriate payments, the bill requires the Department of Human Services
(which administers the three programs) to establish information sharing
procedures with the Department of Corrections, the Administrative Office of the
Courts, and individual counties, as necessary, to obtain complete, up-to-date
information, on at least a monthly basis, on individuals who are incarcerated
in the custody of the State or a county.  The bill also requires the department
to compare, on at least a monthly basis, this information to its enrollment
data the for Medicaid, Work First New Jersey, and SNAP programs, and
immediately suspend the eligibility of any individual who is incarcerated and
is ineligible to receive benefits in any of the programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends current
law to eliminate the authority of the Commissioner of Human Services to extend
eligibility for Medicaid to incarcerated individuals in the first month of
their incarceration, and to clarify that payments to Medicaid managed care
organizations for care or services for an incarcerated individual are
prohibited.  The bill also eliminates the commissioners authority to extend
Work First New Jersey eligibility to incarcerated individuals by regulation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill was inspired by the May
29, 2013 report by the Office of the State Comptroller, which identified
improper payments totaling more than $12.6 million in these three programs
between July 1, 2009 and April 30, 2011.</p>
