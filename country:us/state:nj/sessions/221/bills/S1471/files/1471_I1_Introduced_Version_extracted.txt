Such notice shall be provided as a rider to any written residential lease agreement and in writing at least annually.  A copy of this notice shall be maintained in a conspicuous location in the common area where notices are regularly provided to tenants. c.     An owner who leases any property subject to the requirements of subsection a. of this section in violation of the requirements of this section shall be subject to a fine [of not more than $500], which may be collected and enforced [by the enforcing agency by summary proceeding pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.)] pursuant to section 19 of P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-210). d.    A tenant, occupant, or other person on the premises who sustains an injury as a result of the failure of an owner to comply with the requirements of subsection a. of this section may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for any appropriate legal or equitable relief.
