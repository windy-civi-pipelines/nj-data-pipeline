The bill would also require local government units and qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations to prepare and implement forest stewardship plans when they acquire lands for recreation and conservation purposes that contain 25 acres or more of forested area.  Local government units and qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations would be required to submit their plans to the DEP for review and approval.  The DEP would be required to approve, approve with changes, or disapprove the plan within 30 days after receipt.  If the DEP disapproves a plan, the local government unit or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization would be required to work with the DEP to develop a mutually acceptable plan. A forest stewardship plan prepared and implemented pursuant to the bill would be required to conform with the DEPs rules and regulations adopted pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-36) designed to ensure the sustainability of forest lands. Lastly, the bill directs the DEP, when prioritizing applications submitted by local government units or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organizations for funding for the acquisition or development of lands for recreation and conservation purposes, to give a higher weight to any application submitted by a local government unit or qualifying tax exempt nonprofit organization, as applicable, that implements a forest stewardship plan on lands owned for recreation and conservation purposes by that entity for which a forest stewardship plan is not required pursuant to the bill.  This additional weight would be in addition to any other criteria and ranking procedures established by the DEP pursuant to law.
