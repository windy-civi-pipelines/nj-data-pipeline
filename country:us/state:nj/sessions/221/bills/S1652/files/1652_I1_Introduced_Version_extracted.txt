STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Speed Limit Sanity Act, requires the New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT), the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA), and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) to determine through traffic engineering speed surveys the speed at which vehicles are traveling on every eligible limited access highway under their jurisdiction.  An eligible limited access highway is defined to mean a public highway especially designed for through traffic, over which abutters have no easement or right of light, air, or direct access by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon that limited access highway, and which is under the jurisdiction of the DOT, the NJTA, or the SJTA. The posted speed limit for any segment of an eligible limited access highway is to be set at the 85th percentile speed of the highway, as determined by the traffic engineering survey, rounded to the next highest five miles per hour.  In addition to traffic engineering studies conducted pursuant to the bill, the DOT, NJTA, and SJTA are allowed to use traffic engineering studies that have been conducted within the two year period prior to the effective date of the bill.  The posted speed limit is to be reevaluated through a traffic engineering speed survey not less than once every 10 years and any time the limited access highway is substantially altered. Under the bill, the fine for a speeding violation on any highway where the speed limit has not been based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey is $20 for each offense, until the speed limit is set based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey for the highway. Motor vehicle penalty points or automobile insurance eligibility points are not to be assessed for a speeding violation on any highway where the speed limit has not been based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey until the speed limit is set based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey for the highway.  However, the fines and penalties for a violation of a driving under the influence, refusal of a breath alcohol test, operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol while under the legal age to consume alcohol, use of a wireless telephone while driving, or a motor vehicle offense in an area of highway construction, repair, or designated safe area, are to be assessed in addition to the fine of $20 when those violations are committed in combination with a speeding violation. Finally, this bill repeals the "Sixty-Five MPH Speed Limit Implementation Act."

STATEMENT This bill, designated as the Speed Limit Sanity Act, requires the New Jersey Department of Transportation (DOT), the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA), and the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA) to determine through traffic engineering speed surveys the speed at which vehicles are traveling on every eligible limited access highway under their jurisdiction.  An eligible limited access highway is defined to mean a public highway especially designed for through traffic, over which abutters have no easement or right of light, air, or direct access by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon that limited access highway, and which is under the jurisdiction of the DOT, the NJTA, or the SJTA. The posted speed limit for any segment of an eligible limited access highway is to be set at the 85th percentile speed of the highway, as determined by the traffic engineering survey, rounded to the next highest five miles per hour.  In addition to traffic engineering studies conducted pursuant to the bill, the DOT, NJTA, and SJTA are allowed to use traffic engineering studies that have been conducted within the two year period prior to the effective date of the bill.  The posted speed limit is to be reevaluated through a traffic engineering speed survey not less than once every 10 years and any time the limited access highway is substantially altered. Under the bill, the fine for a speeding violation on any highway where the speed limit has not been based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey is $20 for each offense, until the speed limit is set based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey for the highway. Motor vehicle penalty points or automobile insurance eligibility points are not to be assessed for a speeding violation on any highway where the speed limit has not been based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey until the speed limit is set based on a traffic engineering study and speed survey for the highway.  However, the fines and penalties for a violation of a driving under the influence, refusal of a breath alcohol test, operating a motor vehicle after consuming alcohol while under the legal age to consume alcohol, use of a wireless telephone while driving, or a motor vehicle offense in an area of highway construction, repair, or designated safe area, are to be assessed in addition to the fine of $20 when those violations are committed in combination with a speeding violation. Finally, this bill repeals the "Sixty-Five MPH Speed Limit Implementation Act."
