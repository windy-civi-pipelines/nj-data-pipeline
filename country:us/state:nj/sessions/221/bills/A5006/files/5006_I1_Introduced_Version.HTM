A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director.

Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.    Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

(cf: P.L. 2018, c.131, s.8) 2.    Section 13 of P.L.2023, c.96 (C.54A:5-19) is amended to read as follows: 13. a. For the purposes of the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2023, notwithstanding any provision in N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. or the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) to the contrary, a taxpayer that is subject to the provisions of N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. and engages in a trade or business, regardless of business form, or is a partner in a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation, which trade, business, partnership, or S corporation conducts business operations partly within and partly without this State and, as a result thereof or for other reasons that portion of the income from sources within the State cannot readily or accurately be ascertained, the income from the trade, business, partnership, or S corporation shall be sourced in a manner consistent with the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10). Income that is representative of the taxpayer's salary, wages, [tips,] fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration shall be sourced pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. b.    The director shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. (cf: P.L.2023, c.96, s.13) 3.  N.J.S.54A:6-5 is amended to read as follows: 54A:6-5.  a.  The value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance. b.  Income.  Subsection a. shall not exclude from gross income: 1.  The income from any property referred to in subsection a. 2.  Where the gift, bequest, devise or inheritance is of income from property, the amount of such income. c.  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection b. of this section to the contrary, tips received for services rendered, whether in cash or in property, shall be treated as property acquired by gift and shall be excluded from gross income. (cf: N.J.S.54A:6-5) 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after the January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill excludes income earned in the form of tips from the gross income tax. Under current law, the State defines gross income as, among other categories of income, salaries, wages, tips, fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services rendered.  Subject to minimum gross income thresholds identified under the law and specific deductions for which a tax filer is deemed eligible, all income from tips is treated as taxable income.  However, under current law, the value of property an individual acquires by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance is specifically excluded from gross income, except for the income received from property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance that has an income-generating capacity. Specifically, the bill eliminates tips as a category of income that is included in the calculation of gross income for State income tax purposes.  The bill also specifies that tips received for services rendered, whether in cash or in property, would be treated as property acquired by gift, and therefore specifically excluded from the calculation of gross income.

For the purposes of the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2023, notwithstanding any provision in N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. or the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-1 et seq.) to the contrary, a taxpayer that is subject to the provisions of N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. and engages in a trade or business, regardless of business form, or is a partner in a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation, which trade, business, partnership, or S corporation conducts business operations partly within and partly without this State and, as a result thereof or for other reasons that portion of the income from sources within the State cannot readily or accurately be ascertained, the income from the trade, business, partnership, or S corporation shall be sourced in a manner consistent with the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of the Corporation Business Tax Act (1945), P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-6 through C.54:10A-10).

(cf: P.L.2023, c.96, s.13) 3.  N.J.S.54A:6-5 is amended to read as follows: 54A:6-5.  a.  The value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance. b.  Income.  Subsection a. shall not exclude from gross income: 1.  The income from any property referred to in subsection a. 2.  Where the gift, bequest, devise or inheritance is of income from property, the amount of such income. c.  Notwithstanding any provision of subsection b. of this section to the contrary, tips received for services rendered, whether in cash or in property, shall be treated as property acquired by gift and shall be excluded from gross income. (cf: N.J.S.54A:6-5) 4. This act shall take effect immediately and shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after the January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill excludes income earned in the form of tips from the gross income tax. Under current law, the State defines gross income as, among other categories of income, salaries, wages, tips, fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services rendered.  Subject to minimum gross income thresholds identified under the law and specific deductions for which a tax filer is deemed eligible, all income from tips is treated as taxable income.  However, under current law, the value of property an individual acquires by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance is specifically excluded from gross income, except for the income received from property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance that has an income-generating capacity. Specifically, the bill eliminates tips as a category of income that is included in the calculation of gross income for State income tax purposes.  The bill also specifies that tips received for services rendered, whether in cash or in property, would be treated as property acquired by gift, and therefore specifically excluded from the calculation of gross income.
