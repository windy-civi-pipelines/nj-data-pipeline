All interest or other income or earnings derived from the investment or reinvestment of moneys in the subaccount shall be credited thereto and shall be determined on an aggregate basis for all participating employers. The State Treasurer shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act, P.L.2019, c.143 (C.52:14-17.30a et al.).
