Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge and remain undeveloped. This bill provides the necessary authorization for the DEP to convey the Lacey Township and Stafford Township parcels to the USFWS as of the land exchange.  The bill provides that the acreages involved in the exchange may be adjusted as necessary to equalize the real estate value of the exchange.
