(2)   The head of the ambulance, first aid, and rescue squad shall seek reimbursement from the emergency medical technician, if the emergency medical technician ceases to be a volunteer in good standing, for monies paid out of the fund in connection with that emergency medical technician's training, testing, certification, or recertification, as appropriate, in connection with the initial three-year certification period in which the emergency medical technician ceased to be a volunteer in good standing.  However, an emergency medical technician who ceases to be a volunteer in good standing in order to attend a public or private institution of higher education shall not be responsible for reimbursing the fund.  The Department of Health shall exercise oversight authority over the collection of funds pursuant to this paragraph. d.    As used in this section: "Public or private institution of higher education" means any public university or college, or any private college, university, or institute [incorporated and] located in [New Jersey] the United States, which by virtue of law or character or license is a nonprofit educational institution authorized to grant academic degrees, provides a level of education equivalent to the education provided by the State's public institutions of higher education [as attested by the receipt of and continuation of regional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and is eligible to receive State aid under the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of New Jersey].
