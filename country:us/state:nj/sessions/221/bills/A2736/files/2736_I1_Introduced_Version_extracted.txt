Under current State law, hunting is prohibited on Sundays, with certain limited exceptions.  Although federal agencies may permit hunting on their lands, these agencies are subject to both State and federal laws regarding hunting.  Thus, under current law, an individual may not hunt on Sundays on federal military installations in the State.
