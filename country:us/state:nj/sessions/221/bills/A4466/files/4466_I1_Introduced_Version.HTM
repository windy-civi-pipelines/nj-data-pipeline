If a county board of taxation completes the bulk mailing of notification of assessment, the tax administrator of the county board of taxation shall within 10 days of the completion of the bulk mailing prepare and keep on file a certification setting forth the date on which the bulk mailing was completed. A taxpayer shall have 45 days to file an appeal upon the issuance of a notification of a change in assessment. An appeal to the Tax Court by one party in a case in which the Tax Court has jurisdiction shall establish jurisdiction over the entire matter in the Tax Court, and the county board of taxation shall dismiss without prejudice any petition pending before it with respect to the same property.  All appeals to the Tax Court hereunder shall be in accordance with the provisions of the State Uniform Tax Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et seq. b.    No taxpayer or taxing district shall be entitled to appeal either an assessment or an exemption or both that is based on a financial agreement subject to the provisions of the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law" under the appeals process set forth in subsection a. of this section. c.     In the case of a municipality located in a county wherein the county board of taxation is participating in the demonstration program established in section 4 of the "Real Property Assessment Demonstration Program," P.L.2013, c.15 (C.54:1-104), absent good cause, a property owner shall not be entitled to appeal an assessment on a parcel of real property if the assessor's or the county board of taxation's request to internally inspect the property, made after the appeal is filed, has been refused by the property owner. (cf:  P.L.2021, c.136, s.2) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill concerns the appeal by a taxpayer, or a taxing district, of the assessed valuation of a parcel of real property having an assessed valuation of more than $1,000,000. R.S.54:3-21 currently provides that a taxpayer or a taxing district may file a complaint appealing the current assessment directly with the Tax Court, if the assessed valuation of the property subject to the appeal exceeds $1,000,000. The statute also provides that an appeal to the Tax Court by one party in a case in which the Tax Court has jurisdiction establishes jurisdiction over the entire matter in the Tax Court. This bill would require that in the case where appeals on a single property for a single tax year have been filed with both the Tax Court and the county board of taxation, the county board of taxation shall dismiss the appeal before it without prejudice.
