(2)   The video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera may be deactivated, consistent with directives or guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, under the following circumstances: (a)   when a civilian conversing with the officer requests that the device be deactivated where it reasonably appears that the person will not provide information or otherwise cooperate with the officer unless that request is respected; (b)   when a person, other than an arrestee, is seeking emergency medical services for themselves or another person and requests that the device be deactivated; (c)   while the officer is participating in a discussion pertaining to criminal investigation strategy and planning, provided that the discussion is not conducted in the immediate presence of a civilian and further provided that the officer is not actively engaged in the collection of physical evidence; or (d)   when specifically authorized to do so by an assistant prosecutor or an assistant or deputy attorney general for good and sufficient cause as determined by the assistant prosecutor or assistant or deputy attorney general.

(4)   The officer shall not activate the video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera, or shall deactivate a device that has been activated, if the officer knows or reasonably believes that the recording would risk revealing the identity of an individual as an undercover officer or confidential informant or otherwise would pose a risk to the safety of an undercover officer or confidential informant, unless such activation is expressly authorized by a supervisor, or unless the exigency of the situation and danger posed to an officer require that the encounter or incident be recorded, in which event the officer shall inform his or her supervisor that the recording risks revealing the identity of an individual as an undercover officer or confidential informant. (5)   An officer shall not activate a body worn camera while in a courtroom during court proceedings, unless the officer is responding to a call for service or is authorized to use constructive force or authority. (6)   If the body worn camera model selected by a law enforcement agency produces radio-frequency interference while activated or while in standby mode, the device shall be deactivated while in the area where an electronic alcohol breath testing device is being used, or, as necessary, shall be removed from the area where such device is being used.  Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the use of a body worn camera to record the behavior of a person arrested for driving while intoxicated other than while the person is in the breath-testing area while the electronic breath testing device is being operated.  If this provision requires deactivation of a body worn camera, the officer shall narrate the reasons for deactivation, and the device shall be re-activated when safe and practicable to do so following the completion of the breath testing operation. d.    A law enforcement officer who is wearing a body worn camera shall notify the subject of the recording that the subject is being recorded by the body worn camera unless it is unsafe or infeasible to provide such notification.  Such notification shall be made as close to the inception of the encounter as is reasonably possible. If the officer does not provide the required notification because it is unsafe or infeasible to do so, the officer shall document the reasons for that decision in a report or by narrating the reasons on the body worn camera recording, or both.  The failure to verbally notify a person pursuant to this section shall not affect the admissibility of any statement or evidence. e.     Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection c. of this section: (1)   prior to entering a private residence, a law enforcement officer shall notify the occupant that the occupant is being recorded by the body worn camera and, if the occupant requests the officer to discontinue use of the officer's body worn camera, the officer shall immediately discontinue use of the body worn camera unless the officer is actively engaged in investigating the commission of a criminal offense, or is responding to an emergency, or reasonably believes that the officer will be required to use constructive authority or force; (2)   when interacting with an apparent crime victim, a law enforcement officer shall, as soon as practicable, notify the apparent crime victim that he or she is being recorded by the body worn camera and, if the apparent crime victim requests the officer to discontinue use of the body worn camera, the officer shall immediately discontinue use of the body worn camera; and (3)   when interacting with a person seeking to anonymously report a crime or assist in an ongoing law enforcement investigation, a law enforcement officer, if the person requests that the officer discontinue use of the body worn camera, shall evaluate the circumstances and, if appropriate, discontinue use of the body worn camera. f.     A request to discontinue the use of a body worn camera made to a law enforcement officer pursuant to subsection e. of this section and the response to the request shall be recorded by the recording system prior to discontinuing use of the recording system. g.    A body worn camera shall not be used surreptitiously. h.    A body worn camera shall not be used to gather intelligence information based on First Amendment protected speech, associations, or religion, or to record activity that is unrelated to a response to a call for service or a law enforcement or investigative encounter between a law enforcement officer and a member of the public, provided that nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit activation of video and audio recording functions of a body worn camera as authorized under this law and in accordance with any applicable guidelines or directives promulgated by the Attorney General. i.     Every law enforcement agency shall promulgate and adhere to a policy, standing operating procedure, directive, or order which meets the requirements of subsection j. of this act and any applicable guideline or directive promulgated by the Attorney General that specifies the period of time during which a body worn camera recording shall be retained. j.     A body worn camera recording shall be retained by the law enforcement agency that employs the officer for a retention period consistent with the provisions of this section, after which time the recording shall be permanently deleted.  A body worn camera recording shall be retained for not less than 180 days from the date it was recorded, which minimum time frame for retention shall be applicable to all contracts for retention of body worn camera recordings executed by or on behalf of a law enforcement agency on or after the effective date of this act, and shall be subject to the following additional retention periods: (1)   a body worn camera recording shall automatically be retained for not less than three years if it captures images involving an encounter about which a complaint has been registered by a subject of the body worn camera recording;

(b)   a law enforcement officer who is a subject of the body worn camera recording, if that officer reasonably asserts the recording has evidentiary or exculpatory value; (c)   any immediate supervisor of a law enforcement officer whose body worn camera made the recording or who is a subject of the body worn camera recording, if that immediate supervisor reasonably asserts the recording has evidentiary or exculpatory value;

(f)   any parent or legal guardian of a minor who is a subject of the body worn camera recording; or (g)   a deceased subject's next of kin or legally authorized designee.

(3)   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a law enforcement officer to review a body worn camera recording prior to creating any required initial reports, statements, and interviews regarding the recorded event, nor to prevent a law enforcement officer from reviewing or receiving an accounting of such a body worn camera recording subsequent to the creation of any required initial report, statement, or interview regarding the recorded event. o.    Body worn camera recordings shall not be divulged or used by any law enforcement agency for any commercial or other non-law enforcement purpose. p.    If a law enforcement agency authorizes a third party to act as its agent in maintaining recordings from a body worn camera, the agent shall be prohibited from independently accessing, viewing, or altering any recordings, except to delete recordings as required by law or agency retention policies. q.    If a law enforcement officer, employee, or agent fails to adhere to the recording or retention requirements contained in this act, or intentionally interferes with a body worn camera's ability to accurately capture audio or video recordings: (1)   the officer, employee, or agent shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action; (2)   there shall be a rebuttable presumption that exculpatory evidence was destroyed or not captured in favor of a criminal defendant who reasonably asserts that exculpatory evidence was destroyed or not captured; and (3)   there shall be a rebuttable presumption that evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim was destroyed or not captured in favor of a civil plaintiff suing the government, a law enforcement agency, or a law enforcement officer for damages based on police misconduct if the plaintiff reasonably asserts that evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim was destroyed or not captured. r.     Any recordings from a body worn camera recorded in contravention of this or any other applicable law shall be immediately destroyed and shall not be admissible as evidence in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding. s.     Nothing in this act shall be deemed to contravene any laws governing the maintenance and destruction of evidence in a criminal investigation or prosecution. (cf: P.L.2021, c.472, s.1) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month next following enactment. STATEMENT Under current law, every uniformed State, county, and municipal patrol law enforcement officer, with certain exceptions, is required to wear a body worn camera that electronically records audio and video while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill specifically requires campus police officers to wear a body worn camera while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill also clarifies the definition of a law enforcement officer, as it relates to the regulations for using body worn cameras, to include campus police officers.

STATEMENT Under current law, every uniformed State, county, and municipal patrol law enforcement officer, with certain exceptions, is required to wear a body worn camera that electronically records audio and video while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill specifically requires campus police officers to wear a body worn camera while acting in the performance of the officers official duties. This bill also clarifies the definition of a law enforcement officer, as it relates to the regulations for using body worn cameras, to include campus police officers.
