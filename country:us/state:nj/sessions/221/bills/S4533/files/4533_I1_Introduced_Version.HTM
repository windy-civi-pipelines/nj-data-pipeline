Section 1 of P.L.2013, c.272 (C.2C:33-4.1) is amended to read as follows: 1. a. A person commits the crime of cyber-harassment if, while making one or more communications in an online capacity via any electronic device or through a social networking site, and with the purpose to harass another or with reckless disregard for the safety of another, the person: (1) threatens to inflict injury or physical harm to any person or the property of any person; (2) knowingly sends, posts, comments, requests, suggests, or proposes any lewd, indecent, or obscene material to or about a person recklessly or with the intent to emotionally harm a reasonable person or place a reasonable person in fear of physical or emotional harm to his person; or (3) threatens to commit any crime against the person or the persons property. b.    (1) Cyber-harassment committed purposely or intentionally is a crime of the fourth degree, unless the person is 21 years of age or older at the time of the offense and impersonates a minor for the purpose of cyber-harassing a minor, in which case it is a crime of the third degree. (2) Cyber-harassment committed with reckless disregard for the safety of another is a disorderly persons offense. c.     If a minor under the age of 16 is adjudicated delinquent for cyber-harassment, the court may order as a condition of the sentence that the minor, accompanied by a parent or guardian, complete, in a satisfactory manner, one or both of the following: (1) a class or training program intended to reduce the tendency toward cyber-harassment behavior; or (2) a class or training program intended to bring awareness to the dangers associated with cyber-harassment. d.    A parent or guardian who fails to comply with a condition imposed by the court pursuant to subsection c. of this section is a disorderly person and shall be fined not more than $100 for a first offense and not more than $500 for each subsequent offense. e.     The trier of fact may infer that a person acted with a purpose to harass another if the person knows or should have known that any of the persons actions constituting an offense under this section are knowingly directed to or are about a judicial officer, and there is a nexus between the offense and relates to the performance of the judges public duties.  For the purposes of this subsection, judicial officer has the same meaning as defined in section 1 of P.L.1995, c.23 (C.47:1A-1.1). f.     In addition to any other disposition or condition imposed pursuant to this section, a parent or guardian having legal custody of a minor who demonstrates willful or wanton disregard in the exercise of the supervision and control of the conduct of a minor adjudicated delinquent of cyber-harassment pursuant to this section may be liable in a civil action pursuant to section 4 of P.L.2021, c.338 (C.2A:53A-17.1).

If a person 21 years of age or older impersonates a minor for the purpose of cyber-harassing the minor, it is a crime of the third degree. Under the bill, a person commits the crime of cyber-harassment if the person makes a communication with reckless disregard for the safety of another and knowingly sends, posts, comments, requests, suggests, or proposes any lewd, indecent, or obscene material to or about a person recklessly.  Cyber-harassment committed recklessly is a disorderly persons offense. A crime of the fourth degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to 18 months, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.  A crime of the third degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of three to five years, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.  A disorderly persons offense is punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.
