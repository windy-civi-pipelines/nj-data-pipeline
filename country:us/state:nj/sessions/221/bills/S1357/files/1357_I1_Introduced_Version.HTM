<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  For privilege
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 but before January 1, 2024, a
taxpayer shall be allowed a credit for the privilege period against the tax
imposed pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5), in an amount
equal to 35 percent of the taxpayers insourcing expenses from outside the
United States and 25 percent of the taxpayers insourcing expenses from within
the United States but outside this State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The credit shall be allowed
for the privilege period during which the written plan to carry out the insourcing
has been completed and all insourcing expenses pursuant to the plan have been
paid or incurred, provided however, that no credit shall be allowed unless the
number of full-time employees of the taxpayer at locations in this State during
the privilege period for which the credit is claimed exceeds the number of
full-time employees of the taxpayer at locations in this State during the
privilege period for which the insourcing expenses were first paid or incurred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     An unused credit may be
carried forward, if necessary, for use in the four privilege periods following
the privilege period for which the credit is allowed, provided it is used
before January 1, 2025.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the taxpayer reduces the
number of full-time employees at locations in this State in any of the five
privilege periods following the privilege period for which the credit is
allowed, the director shall issue a tax assessment for the recapture of the credit
previously allowed pursuant to this section and shall deny any outstanding
credit allowed pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The order of priority of
the application of the credit allowed pursuant to this section and any other
credits allowed by law shall be as prescribed by the director.  The amount of
the credit applied under this section against the tax imposed pursuant to
section 5 of P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5) for a privilege period, together with
any other credits allowed by law, shall not exceed 50 percent of the tax
liability otherwise due and shall not reduce the tax liability to an amount
less than the statutory minimum provided in subsection (e) of section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).  No amount of expense claimed as a credit
pursuant to this section shall be allowed as an amount calculated or claimed
pursuant to any other credit against the tax imposed pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1945, c.162 (C.54:10A-5).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     As used in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Business unit means any
trade or business, any line of business, and any functional unit of any trade
or business or of any line of business.</p>

means a person employed by the taxpayer for consideration for at least 35 hours
a week, or who renders any other standard of service generally accepted by
custom or practice as full-time employment, or a person who is employed by a
professional employer organization pursuant to an employee leasing agreement
between the taxpayer and the professional employer organization, in accordance
with P.L.2001, c.260 (C.34:8-67&nbsp;et&nbsp;seq.)&nbsp;for&nbsp;at least 35
hours a week, or who renders any other standard of service generally accepted
by custom or practice as full-time employment, and whose wages are subject to
withholding as provided in the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,&quot;
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq. or an employee who is a resident of another State but
whose income is not subject to the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,&quot;
N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., or who renders any other standard of service generally
accepted by custom or practice as full-time employment, and whose distributive
share of income, gain, loss, or deduction, or whose guaranteed payments, or any
combination thereof, is subject to the payment of estimated taxes, as provided
in the &quot;New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act,&quot; N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq.
&quot;Full-time employee&quot; shall not include any person who works as an
independent contractor or on a consulting basis for the taxpayer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Insourcing expense means the
net of expenses paid or incurred and amounts realized, if any, on liquidation
associated with the elimination of a business unit of the taxpayer located
outside the United States or in the United States but outside this State, and expenses
paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the establishment of a
business unit of the taxpayer located within this State that replaces the
eliminated unit outside the United States or outside this State, and includes
expenses paid or incurred for moving employees, but does not include any
compensation or other remuneration paid or incurred in connection with
severance from employment; provided however, amounts shall be taken into
account only to the extent that those amounts are paid or incurred pursuant to
a written plan to carry out the elimination and replacement of the business
unit, and provided further, amounts shall be taken into account only to the
extent that those amounts do not include expenses paid or incurred by the
taxpayer in connection with relocating an existing business unit already
present in this State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    a.  For taxable years
commencing January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2023, a taxpayer shall be allowed
a credit for the taxable year against the tax otherwise due for the taxable

class=HangingAnActChar>For decades businesses have had incentives to outsource
business functions, pursuing lower tax rates or labor costs. The credit

relocate to New Jersey and take advantage of the States robust and diverse
labor pool. </span></p>

the credit outstanding will be denied and any amount previously allowed will be
subject to recapture by the State.</span></p>
