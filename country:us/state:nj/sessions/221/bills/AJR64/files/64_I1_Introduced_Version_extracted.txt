STATEMENT This joint resolution designates November 22 of each year as Kimchi Day in the State of New Jersey. Kimchi is a traditional dish in Korean cuisine consisting of salted and fermented vegetables made with a widely varying selection of seasonings.  Kimchi has a long rich history dating back thousands of years.  The preparation of kimchi allowed the Korean people a means of preserving food that served as a vital source of sustenance throughout history.  Kimchi can be found in the homes of millions of Koreans around the world and is often eaten with every meal. While kimchi has historically been a critical source of nutrients, it has become so ingrained in the culture of the Korean people that it is now a source of national pride and identity. Kimjang, the tradition of preparing kimchi, brings whole communities together to collectively prepare and share large quantities to kimchi to ensure that every household has enough to sustain it through the long, often harsh, Korean winters.  Kimjang is so culturally important to the Korean people that it has been recognized by the United Nations by being added in 2013 to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Kimchi has been widely acknowledged as a probiotic food with well-established positive health benefits, serving as an excellent source of beta-carotene, calcium, potassium, dietary fiber, and vitamins A, B, C, and K, which can potentially lower rates of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. National Kimchi Day is celebrated in South Korea on November 22 to promote the value of the kimchi. This date is in recognition of the 11 traditional ingredients of kimchi and the 22 health benefits its consumption promotes. New Jersey has a significant population of approximately 105,000 residents of Korean descent with 60 percent living in Bergen County.  By setting aside November 22 of each year as Kimchi Day, we can celebrate the culture and traditions of Koreans around the world and in the State of New Jersey.
