allowance for members of the Public Employees Retirement System and amending
P.L.1954, c.84.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 43 of P.L.1954,
c.84 (C.43:15A-43) is amended to read as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     43.  a.  A member who has not
attained age 65 shall, upon the application of the head of the department in
which he is employed or upon his own application or the application of one
acting in his behalf, be retired by the board of trustees, if said employee is
permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event
occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned
duties, on an accidental disability allowance.  A traumatic event occurring
during voluntary performance of regular or assigned duties at a place of
employment before or after required hours of employment which is not in
violation of any valid work rule of the employer or otherwise prohibited by the
employer shall be deemed as occurring during the performance of regular or
assigned duties. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The application to accomplish
such retirement must be filed within five years of the original traumatic event,
but the board of trustees may consider an application filed after the five-year
period if it can be factually demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of
trustees that the disability is due to the accident and the filing was not
accomplished within the five-year period due to a delayed manifestation of the
disability or to circumstances beyond the control of the member. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Permanent and total disability
resulting from a cardiovascular, pulmonary or musculo-skeletal condition which
was not a direct result of a traumatic event occurring in the performance of
duty shall be deemed an ordinary disability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Before consideration of the
application by the board of trustees, the physician or physicians designated by
the board shall have first made a medical examination of the member at his
residence or at any other place mutually agreed upon and shall have certified
to the board that he is physically or mentally incapacitated for the
performance of duty, and should be retired, and the appointing authority shall
have certified to the board that the member is permanently and totally disabled
as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the
performance of his regular or assigned duties, the time and place where the
duty causing the disability was performed, that the disability was not the
result of his willful negligence and that the member should be retired.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     No person who becomes a member
of the retirement system on or after the effective date of P.L.2010, c.3 shall
be eligible for retirement pursuant to this section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1) For purposes of this
subsection: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Qualifying condition or
impairment of health&quot; includes:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the upper
respiratory tract and mucosae, including conditions such as conjunctivitis,
rhinitis, sinusitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, vocal cord disease, upper airway
hyper-reactivity and tracheo-bronchitis, or a combination of such conditions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the lower
respiratory tract, including but not limited to bronchitis, asthma, reactive
airway dysfunction syndrome, and different types of pneumonitis, such as
hypersensitivity, granulomatous, or eosinophilic;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the
gastroesophageal tract, including esophagitis and reflux disease, either acute
or chronic, caused by exposure or aggravated by exposure;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the psychological
axis, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, or any
combination of such conditions;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     diseases of the skin such as
contact dermatitis or burns, either acute or chronic in nature, infectious,
irritant, allergic, idiopathic or non-specific reactive in nature, caused by
exposure or aggravated by exposure; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     new onset diseases resulting
from exposure as such diseases occurring in the future including cancer,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asbestos-related disease, heavy metal
poisoning, musculoskeletal disease and chronic psychological disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;World Trade Center
rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations&quot; means the rescue, recovery, or
cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between September 11, 2001
and October 11, 2001.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;World Trade Center
site&quot; means any location below a line starting from the Hudson River and
Canal Street, east on Canal Street to Pike Street, south on Pike Street to the
East River, and extending to the lower tip of Manhattan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding any
provision of subsection a. of this section or any other law to the contrary,
for a member who participated, whether or not under orders or instruction by an
employer to so participate, in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup
operations for a minimum of eight hours, permanent and total disability
resulting from a qualifying condition or impairment of health shall be presumed
to have occurred during and as a result of the performance of the member's regular
or assigned duties and not the result of the member's willful negligence,
unless the contrary can be proved by competent evidence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A member who did not
participate in such operations for a minimum of eight hours shall be eligible
for the presumption provided that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     the member participated in the
rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations at the World Trade Center site between
September 11, 2001 and September 12, 2001; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     the member sustained a
documented physical injury at the World Trade Center site between September 11,
2001 and September 12, 2001 that is a qualifying condition or impairment of
health resulting in a disability to the member that prevented the member from
continuing to participate in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A law recently enacted,
P.L.2019, 157, provided that a member or retiree of the Police and Firemens
Retirement System (PFRS), the State Police Retirement System (SPRS), and the
Public Employees Retirement System (PERS) is eligible to receive an accidental
disability retirement allowance for a permanent and total disability resulting
from participation in 9/11 World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup
operations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The law provides that
permanent and total disability resulting from a qualifying condition or
impairment of health will be presumed to have occurred during and as a result
of the performance of a members regular or assigned duties if the member
participated in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations for
a minimum of eight hours.  The law permits a member who did not participate in
those operations for a minimum of eight hours to be eligible for the
presumption under certain circumstances. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The law also provides for a
reclassification of a retirees retirement from a service retirement or an
ordinary disability retirement to an accidental disability retirement under
certain circumstances.  The law applies regardless of whether the PERS member
or retiree was enrolled in the PERS at the time of the participation in the
rescue, recovery and cleanup operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Currently, the PERS portion of
the bill applies only to: any member or retiree who is or was enrolled in the
PERS because the member or retiree did not meet the age or medical requirements
for enrollment in the Police and Firemens Retirement System on the basis of
the position held; and to any emergency medical technician who is a member or
retiree of the Public Employees Retirement System.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends the relevant
provisions of the PERS to provide this benefit to any member of the PERS.</p>
