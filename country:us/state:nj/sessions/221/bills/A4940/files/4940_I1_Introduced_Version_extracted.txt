The county college may charge a fee for the proposal documentation that shall not exceed $50 or the cost of reproducing the documentation, whichever is greater. b.    Each interested vendor shall submit a proposal which shall include all the information required by the request for proposals. Failure to meet the requirements of the request for proposals may result in the county college disqualifying the vendor from further consideration. The provisions of a proposal shall not be subject to negotiation by the county college. c.     If the county college, at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or perform the services, or both, that are being considered for competitive contracting, the county college shall, at any time prior to, but no later than the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected employees of the county colleges intention to solicit competitive contracting proposals. Employees or their representatives shall be permitted to submit recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment in a manner that meets the goals of the competitive contract. If employees are represented by an organization that has negotiated a contract with the county college, only the bargaining unit shall be authorized to submit the recommendations or proposals. When requested by the employees, the county college shall provide information regarding budgets and the costs of performing the services by the employees, as may be available. Nothing shall prevent the employees from making recommendations that may include modifications to existing labor agreements in order to reduce costs in lieu of the award of a competitive contract, and agreements implementing the recommendations may be considered as cause for rejecting all other proposals. d.    The contracting agent or counsel shall evaluate all proposals only in accordance with the methodology described in the request for proposals.  After proposals have been evaluated, the contracting agent or counsel shall prepare a report evaluating and recommending the award of a contract. The report shall: (1)  list the names of all potential vendors who submitted a proposal; (2)  summarize the proposals of each vendor who submitted a proposal; (3)  rank the vendors in order of evaluation; (4)  recommend the selection of a vendor or vendors, as appropriate, for a contract; (5)  be clear in the reasons why the vendor or vendors have been selected among others considered; (6)  detail the terms, conditions, scope of services, fees, and other matters to be incorporated into a contract; and (7) be made available to the public at least 48 hours prior to the awarding of the contract, or when made available to the board of trustees, whichever is sooner. The county college shall have the right to reject all proposals. e.  The report prepared pursuant to subsection d. of this section shall become part of the public record and shall reflect the final action of the county college. f.  Award of a contract by a county college utilizing competitive contracting shall be made, by resolution of the board of trustees, within 60 days of the receipt of the proposals, except that the proposals of any vendors who consent thereto, may, at the request of the county college, be held for consideration for a longer period as may be agreed. g.    All contracts awarded through competitive contracting pursuant to the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for the provision of goods or performance of services shall be in writing. The board of trustees may, subject to the requirements of law, prescribe the forms and manner that contracts shall be made and executed, and the form and manner of the execution and approval of all guarantee, indemnity, fidelity, and other bonds. h.    The county college shall publish a notice in the legal newspaper of the county college summarizing the award of a contract, which shall include but not be limited to: (1) the nature, duration, and amount of the contract; (2) the name of the vendor; and (3) a statement that the resolution and contract are on file and available for public inspection in the office of the county college. 11.  The Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs, after consultation with the Secretary of Higher Education, may adopt rules and regulations, in accordance with the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of sections 6 through 10 of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 12.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month next following the date of enactment.

The county college may charge a fee for the proposal documentation that shall not exceed $50 or the cost of reproducing the documentation, whichever is greater. b.    Each interested vendor shall submit a proposal which shall include all the information required by the request for proposals. Failure to meet the requirements of the request for proposals may result in the county college disqualifying the vendor from further consideration. The provisions of a proposal shall not be subject to negotiation by the county college. c.     If the county college, at the time of solicitation, utilizes its own employees to provide the goods or perform the services, or both, that are being considered for competitive contracting, the county college shall, at any time prior to, but no later than the time of solicitation for competitive contracting proposals, notify affected employees of the county colleges intention to solicit competitive contracting proposals. Employees or their representatives shall be permitted to submit recommendations and proposals affecting wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment in a manner that meets the goals of the competitive contract.
