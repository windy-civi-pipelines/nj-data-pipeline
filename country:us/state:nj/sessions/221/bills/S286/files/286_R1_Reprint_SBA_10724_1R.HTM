<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  a.  In
addition to being authorized to establish rates or schedules as provided for in
section 1 of P.L.1994, c.78 (C.40:14A-8.2), any county or municipal sewerage
authority, which bills individual retail customer accounts, may, to the extent
permitted by federal law, annually establish within its district rates or
schedules which provide for a reduction of the periodic rents, rates, fees, or
other charges for the use or services of the sewerage system which are charged
to or collected from a person residing in the district, provided that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the person is the owner
or tenant of a dwelling unit in the district and the person resides in the
dwelling unit;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the household income for
the person who resides in the dwelling unit is at or below a percentage of the
most recent federal poverty guidelines, which percentage shall be established
by the county or municipal sewerage authority, but shall be no greater than the
maximum threshold established by the Department of Community Affairs for the
Low Income Household Water Assistance Program or a similar program administered
by the department for assistance with water bills, sewer bills, or both, or in
the absence of such a program, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
administered by the department;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  non-household members do
not pay for the costs of sewer service on behalf of the person;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)  the household does not
consist entirely of students who are tax dependents of another household; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)  the person does not
receive a reduction or total abatement of the periodic rents, rates, fees, or
other charges under section 1 of P.L.1994, c.78 (C.40:14A-8.2) offered by the
county or municipal sewerage authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A county or municipal
sewerage authority that establishes a reduction pursuant to subsection a. of
this section shall adopt procedures for establishing eligibility and obtaining
a reduction, and shall advertise the availability of the reduction in the bills
submitted to residents in the district for periodic rents, rates, fees, or
other charges for the use or services of the sewerage system, or in special
periodic mailings to residents in the district.  For purposes of establishing
eligibility, a resident shall, at minimum, provide information and
documentation concerning identity, income,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'> household, and ownership or
tenancy.  The annual application deadline shall be established no later than 60
days prior to the close of the fiscal year unless the county or municipal
sewerage authority has obtained approval of an application made pursuant to
subsection d. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The provisions of this
section shall apply only if a county or municipal sewerage authority determines
that, with regard to its annual budget, there is a sufficient amount of unrestricted
net position available to be set aside and designated to offset the projected
loss in revenues that may be attributable to providing a reduction permitted
pursuant to subsection a. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Notwithstanding
subsection c. of this section to the contrary, a county or municipal sewerage
authority may request approval from the Director of the Division of Local
Government Services to fund a reduction established pursuant to subsection a.
of this section from its enterprise fund.  The director shall approve the
application if the authority can demonstrate that, based on a rate study
conducted pursuant to section 11 of P.L. 2021, c.184 (C.40A:5A-10.1), the
reduction will not result in: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  an unreasonable increase
in average residential rates, rents, fees, and charges; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the authority having

expenses of operation and maintenance of the sewerage system, including
reserves, insurance, extensions, and replacements, and to pay punctually the
principal of and interest on any bonds and to maintain such reserves or sinking

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When unpaid taxes or any
municipal lien, or part thereof, on real property remain in arrears at the
close of the fiscal year, the collector or other officer charged by law in the
municipality with that duty, shall enforce the lien by selling the property in
the manner set forth in this article by holding a standard tax sale in the
following fiscal year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     When unpaid taxes or any
municipal lien, or part thereof, on real property remains in arrears on the
11th day of the eleventh month in the fiscal year when the taxes or lien became
in arrears, the collector or other officer charged by law in the municipality
with that duty, shall enforce the lien by selling the property in the manner
set forth in this article by conducting an accelerated tax sale by selling the
property in the manner set forth in this article, provided that the sale is
conducted and completed no earlier than in the last month of the fiscal year. 
Whenever the due date for the fourth quarter property tax installment payment
has been extended for real property pursuant to the provisions of subsection a.
of R.S.54:4-67, a municipality shall not conduct an accelerated tax sale with
respect to that installment pursuant to this section.</p>

accelerated tax sale, the municipality may by resolution direct that when
unpaid taxes or other municipal liens or charges, or part thereof, are in
arrears as of the 11th day of the eleventh month of the fiscal year, such sale
shall include only such unpaid taxes or other municipal liens or charges as
were in arrears in the fiscal year designated in such resolution, and may by
resolution, either general or special, direct that there shall be omitted from
such sale any or all such unpaid taxes, and other municipal liens, or parts
thereof, on real property, upon which regular, equal monthly installment
payments are being made, in pursuance to such agreement as may be authorized by
said resolution between the collector and the owner or person interested in the
property upon which such delinquent taxes may be due; provided, that said
agreement shall require payment of such installment payments in amounts large
enough to pay in full all delinquent taxes, assessments and other municipal
liens held by the municipality, in not more than five years from the date of
such agreement; provided, that the extension of time for payment of such
arrearages herein authorized shall not apply to any parcel of property which
prior thereto has been included in any plan theretofore adopted by any
municipality of this State under and pursuant to the provisions of any public statute
of this State whereunder prior extensions for the payment of delinquent taxes
were authorized; provided further, that the right of any person interested in
such property to pay such arrears in such installments shall be conditioned on
the prompt payment of the installments of taxes for the current year in which
such agreement is made, and all subsequent taxes, assessments and other
municipal liens imposed or becoming a lien thereafter, including all
installments thereafter payable on assessments theretofore levied, and also the
prompt payment of all installments of arrears as hereinbefore authorized; and
provided further, that in case any such installment of arrears or any new
taxes, assessments or other liens are not promptly paid, that is to say, within
thirty days after the date when the same is due and payable, then such
agreement shall be void, and in any such case the collector, or other officer
charged by law with that duty, shall proceed to enforce such lien by selling in
the manner in this article provided.</p>

pursuant to P.L.1942, c.251 (C.App.A.9-33 et seq.), or both, in response to a

health emergency, the governing body of a local unit may by resolution, either
general or special, authorize one additional agreement for payment of water,
sewer, stormwater, or electric charges that became delinquent during a public
health emergency or state of emergency substantially impacting the
municipality.  A parcel of property with one such additional agreement shall
not be eligible for a third agreement for payment of subsequent service charges
becoming delinquent during a public health emergency or state of emergency. 
The agreement shall be conditioned upon timely payment of the specified
installments and of all current property taxes and other municipal assessments,
liens, and charges.  In case any such installment of arrears or any current
property taxes and other municipal assessments, liens, and charges are not paid
within 30 days after the date when the same is due and payable, then such

existing agreement to allow for an increase in the duration of the agreement, a
temporary reduction in the portion of monthly installments attributable to
delinquent water, sewer, stormwater, and electric charges, or both, if a
residential customer can demonstrate that their financial circumstances have
changed significantly because of factors beyond the residential customers
control.  A modified agreement shall require the total sum of delinquent payments,
plus any interest and penalties, to be satisfied in full.  When a modified
agreement allows a residential customer to temporarily reduce their monthly
installment obligation, no payment in any given month shall be more than 50
percent lower than the highest monthly installment amount set forth in the
modified agreement.  The duration of the agreement shall not be extended beyond
five years from the date on which the agreement was originally executed.  The
agreement shall be conditioned upon timely payment of the specified
installments and of all current property taxes and other municipal assessments,

property taxes and other municipal assessments, liens, and charges are not paid
