&quot;substantially curtail&quot; shall not mean the discontinuance or
abandonment of a portion of a route or line's service if alternate service is available

light rail line in a way that the headway on the peak service increases by more
than 50 percent, or that more than doubles the non-peak headway; (5) reduces
service on a rail line in a way that reduces the amount of total service on the
line by more than 25 percent or reduces service on a rail line during peak hours
in a way that reduces the total number of daily trips provided during peak
hours; (6) completely closes an existing bus terminal, rail station, or light
rail station; or (7) reduces service that would change the span of service on a
