death benefits for survivors of certain State Police Retirement System (SPRS)
retirees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
surviving spouse or child of a retired member of the SPRS who died on or before
July 8, 2019 and had been receiving an accidental disability retirement
allowance is permitted to apply to receive accidental death benefits if the
retired member had a qualifying condition or impairment of health due to World
Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill removes the
limitation that only a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS retiree
who died before July 8, 2019 is eligible, so that the provisions will apply
regardless of when the SPRS retiree died.  In addition, this bill establishes
eligibility for a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS member who had
been receiving an ordinary disability retirement, a special retirement, or a
service retirement.  This bill prohibits a written and sworn statement from
being required when applying for the accidental death benefits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a spouse or
child is only eligible for accidental death benefits if the member's or
retiree's death was the result of a qualifying condition or impairment of
health which the medical board determines to be caused by participation in
World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations.  This bill also
allows the World Trade Center Health Program to make this determination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the spouse
of a deceased retired member who is receiving a pension due to the death of that
member on or before July 8, 2019 is eligible to apply to the board of trustees
and, upon approval of the application by the board, will receive the accidental
death benefits if the surviving spouse submits sufficient documentation that
the deceased retiree would have qualified for a retirement.  This bill also allows
the spouse to apply if the member did qualify for retirement or if the member
previously filed the required written and sworn statement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires
notification to SPRS surviving spouses and children of the changes made by the
bill by certified mail within 60 days after the bills effective date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a surviving
spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child, or any legal guardian of
the surviving child, must submit an application not later than two years after
the effective date of the law.  This bill allows survivors to submit an
application not later than two years after the date of the member or retirees
death, or two years after the effective date of this bill, whichever is later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a surviving
spouse or former surviving spouse or surviving child, or any legal guardian of
the surviving child, is prohibited from being granted a retroactive payment
based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if
the benefit had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the
benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the effective
date of the law.  This bill also provides that these survivors are prohibited
from being granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the
benefit the person would have received if the benefit had been applicable on
the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received
from that date of death to the date of the application approval if the date of
approval is later than the effective date of the law.</p>
