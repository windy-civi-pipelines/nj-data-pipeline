(6)   The board of trustees shall require the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, to submit such information as the deceased member or retiree would have been required to submit in accordance with subsection e. of section 10 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-10) and such other information as the board of trustees may deem necessary to review the application and make a determination, except that the written and sworn statement specified in paragraph (4) of subsection e. of section 10 of P.L. 1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-10) shall not be required.  Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection shall apply only if the retiree's death was the result of a qualifying condition or impairment of health as defined in subsection e. of section 10 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-10) which the medical board or the World Trade Center Health Program determines to be caused by participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations [and if the deceased member or retiree died before July 8, 2019]. (7)   Upon approval of an application, the surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child or children, or any legal guardian of the surviving child or children, shall receive the annual payments of the accidental death benefit, and the lump sum death benefit payment, as set forth in section 14 of P.L.1965, c.89 (C.53:5A-14).  The annual benefit payments shall apply only for payments made after the effective date of [this act] P.L.2021, c.75.  No surviving spouse or former surviving spouse or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, shall be granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit pursuant to this subsection had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the effective date of [this act] P.L.2021, c.75, or the date of the application approval, whichever is later.  The lump sum benefit paid to a beneficiary shall be and shall not exceed 3 1/2 times the retiree's final compensation in total regardless of the provision of law under which the lump sum death benefit was paid.

(cf: P.L.2021, c.75, s.1) 2.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill extends accidental death benefits for survivors of certain State Police Retirement System (SPRS) retirees. Under current law, the surviving spouse or child of a retired member of the SPRS who died on or before July 8, 2019 and had been receiving an accidental disability retirement allowance is permitted to apply to receive accidental death benefits if the retired member had a qualifying condition or impairment of health due to World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations. This bill removes the limitation that only a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS retiree who died before July 8, 2019 is eligible, so that the provisions will apply regardless of when the SPRS retiree died.  In addition, this bill establishes eligibility for a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS member who had been receiving an ordinary disability retirement, a special retirement, or a service retirement.  This bill prohibits a written and sworn statement from being required when applying for the accidental death benefits. Under current law, a spouse or child is only eligible for accidental death benefits if the member's or retiree's death was the result of a qualifying condition or impairment of health which the medical board determines to be caused by participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations.  This bill also allows the World Trade Center Health Program to make this determination. Under current law, the spouse of a deceased retired member who is receiving a pension due to the death of that member on or before July 8, 2019 is eligible to apply to the board of trustees and, upon approval of the application by the board, will receive the accidental death benefits if the surviving spouse submits sufficient documentation that the deceased retiree would have qualified for a retirement.  This bill also allows the spouse to apply if the member did qualify for retirement or if the member previously filed the required written and sworn statement. This bill requires notification to SPRS surviving spouses and children of the changes made by the bill by certified mail within 60 days after the bills effective date. Under current law, a surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, must submit an application not later than two years after the effective date of the law.  This bill allows survivors to submit an application not later than two years after the date of the member or retirees death, or two years after the effective date of this bill, whichever is later. Under current law, a surviving spouse or former surviving spouse or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, is prohibited from being granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the effective date of the law.  This bill also provides that these survivors are prohibited from being granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the date of the application approval if the date of approval is later than the effective date of the law.

Under current law, the surviving spouse or child of a retired member of the SPRS who died on or before July 8, 2019 and had been receiving an accidental disability retirement allowance is permitted to apply to receive accidental death benefits if the retired member had a qualifying condition or impairment of health due to World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations. This bill removes the limitation that only a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS retiree who died before July 8, 2019 is eligible, so that the provisions will apply regardless of when the SPRS retiree died.  In addition, this bill establishes eligibility for a surviving spouse or child of a qualifying SPRS member who had been receiving an ordinary disability retirement, a special retirement, or a service retirement.  This bill prohibits a written and sworn statement from being required when applying for the accidental death benefits. Under current law, a spouse or child is only eligible for accidental death benefits if the member's or retiree's death was the result of a qualifying condition or impairment of health which the medical board determines to be caused by participation in World Trade Center rescue, recovery, or cleanup operations.  This bill also allows the World Trade Center Health Program to make this determination. Under current law, the spouse of a deceased retired member who is receiving a pension due to the death of that member on or before July 8, 2019 is eligible to apply to the board of trustees and, upon approval of the application by the board, will receive the accidental death benefits if the surviving spouse submits sufficient documentation that the deceased retiree would have qualified for a retirement.  This bill also allows the spouse to apply if the member did qualify for retirement or if the member previously filed the required written and sworn statement. This bill requires notification to SPRS surviving spouses and children of the changes made by the bill by certified mail within 60 days after the bills effective date. Under current law, a surviving spouse, former surviving spouse, or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, must submit an application not later than two years after the effective date of the law.  This bill allows survivors to submit an application not later than two years after the date of the member or retirees death, or two years after the effective date of this bill, whichever is later. Under current law, a surviving spouse or former surviving spouse or surviving child, or any legal guardian of the surviving child, is prohibited from being granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the effective date of the law.  This bill also provides that these survivors are prohibited from being granted a retroactive payment based upon the difference between the benefit the person would have received if the benefit had been applicable on the date of death of the retiree and the benefit that the person has received from that date of death to the date of the application approval if the date of approval is later than the effective date of the law.
