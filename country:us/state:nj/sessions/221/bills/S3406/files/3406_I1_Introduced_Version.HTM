(2) have not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possess a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.98, s.3) 3.    Section 58 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326) is amended to read as follows: 58.  a.  Prior to March 1, 2029, for redevelopment projects eligible pursuant to section 57 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-325) for which a developer is seeking an incentive award for the redevelopment project, the developer shall submit an application to the authority and, in the case of a residential project, shall submit an application to the authority and the agency, in a form and manner prescribed in regulations adopted by the authority pursuant to section 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-335).  The authority shall accept applications for incentive awards during the grant periods established pursuant to section 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-327). b.    The authority shall not consider an application for a commercial project unless the developer submits a letter evidencing support for the commercial project from the governing body of the municipality in which the commercial project is located with the application. c.     The authority shall review the project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, provided that the net benefit analysis shall not apply to capital investment for a food delivery source; a health care or health services center; or a residential project.  In determining whether a project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developer's State or local tax liability.  The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state.  The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant.  A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer's application for a tax credit that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary.  The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed redevelopment project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. d. (1) For a redevelopment project subject to the requirement of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State equaling an amount determined by the authority through regulation that exceeds the requested tax credit amount.  The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this subsection are true and accurate at the time of submission. (2) A redevelopment project located in a government-restricted municipality shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to [35] 50 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (3) A commercial project that contains 50,000 or more square feet of space devoted to research or technology focused incubator and conferencing facilities for one or more institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations, and which has a total project cost of not less than $50 million, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (4) A redevelopment project that is predominantly commercial and that receives a federal historic rehabilitation tax credit pursuant to section 47 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.47, or a tax credit pursuant to the "Historic Property Reinvestment Act," sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through 34:1B-276), shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (5) A commercial project that is located on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005 shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (6) A redevelopment project that is undertaken by a major cultural institution to renovate existing space or expand services into additional space, and in which the major cultural institution realizes all returns from the redevelopment project, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. e.     If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive award. f.     If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.98, s.4) 4.    Section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328) is amended to read as follows: 60.  a.  (1)  Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to sections 58 and 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326 and C.34:1B-327), the authority shall enter into an incentive award agreement with the developer.  The chief executive officer of the authority shall negotiate the terms and conditions of the incentive award agreement on behalf of the State. (2)   For a phased project, the incentive phase agreement shall set forth, for each phase of the project and for the total project, the capital investment requirements and the time periods in which each phase of the project shall be commenced and completed. The awarding of tax credits shall be conditioned on the developer's compliance with the requirements of the agreement.  A redevelopment project may be completed in phases in accordance with rules adopted by the authority if the redevelopment project has a total project cost in excess of $50,000,000. b.    An incentive award agreement shall specify the amount of the incentive award the authority shall award to the developer and the duration of the eligibility period.  The duration of the eligibility period shall not exceed 15 years for a commercial or mixed-use project and shall not exceed 10 years for a residential project, except that to reduce the total value of tax credits needed to reimburse a developer for all or part of the project financing gap of a redevelopment project, the authority may, in its discretion, approve a duration for the eligibility period that is shorter than the applicable maximum periods.  The incentive award agreement shall provide an estimated date of completion and include a requirement for periodic progress reports, including the submittal of executed financing commitments and documents that evidence site control.  If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive award.  If the authority rescinds an incentive award in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive award, then the authority may assign the incentive award to another applicant.  The incentive award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developer's projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. c.     [To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis.  If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive award.  At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developer's rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval.  If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment.  The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period.  Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developer's rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval.  If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds.  If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The incentive award agreement shall include a requirement that the authority confirm with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action for the developer, and the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the redevelopment project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The incentive award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive award in any year in which the developer is neither in substantial good standing with each department nor has entered into a practical corrective action.  The incentive award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. e.     (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the authority shall not enter into an incentive award agreement for a redevelopment project that includes at least one retail establishment which will have more than 10 employees, at least one distribution center which will have more than 20 employees, or at least one hospitality establishment which will have more than 10 employees, unless the incentive award agreement includes a precondition that any business that serves as the owner or operator of the retail establishment, distribution center, or hospitality establishment enters into a labor harmony agreement with a labor organization or cooperating labor organizations which represent retail establishment, hospitality establishment, or distribution center employees in the State. (2)   A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into an incentive award agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be able to go forward if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2023, c.98) f.     (1)  Except for a residential project that is located in a government-restricted municipality, and in which 100 percent of the residential units constructed in the residential project are reserved for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households, for a redevelopment project whose total project cost equals or exceeds $10 million, in addition to the incentive award agreement, a developer shall enter into a community benefits agreement with the authority and the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located.  The agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for training, employment, and youth development and free services to underserved communities in and around the community in which the redevelopment project is located. Prior to entering a community benefits agreement, the governing body of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located shall hold at least one public hearing at which the governing body shall hear testimony from residents, community groups, and other stakeholders on the needs of the community that the agreement should address. (2)   The community benefits agreement shall provide for the creation of a community advisory committee to oversee the implementation of the agreement, monitor successes, ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement, and produce an annual public report.  The community advisory committee created pursuant to this paragraph shall be comprised of representatives of diverse community groups and residents of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located. (3)   At the time the developer submits the annual report required pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330) to the authority, the developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that it is in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement.  If the developer fails to provide the certification required pursuant to this paragraph or the authority determines that the developer is not in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement based on the reports submitted by the community advisory committee pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the authority may rescind an award or recapture all or part of any tax credits awarded. (4)   Notwithstanding any requirement of this subsection to the contrary, a developer shall be considered to have met the requirements of a community benefits agreement pursuant to this subsection if the developer submits to the authority: (a)   a copy of either the developer's approval letter from the authority or a redevelopment agreement applicable to the qualified business facility, provided that the approval letter or redevelopment agreement is certified by the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, and includes provisions that meet or exceed the standards required for a community benefits agreement in this subsection, as determined by the chief executive officer pursuant to rules adopted by the authority; or       (b) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, which resolution shall be adopted after at least one public hearing at which the governing body provides an opportunity for residents, community groups, and other stakeholders to testify, and which resolution shall state that the governing body has determined that the redevelopment project will provide economic and social benefits to the community that fulfill the purposes of this subsection, which benefits render a separate community benefit agreement unnecessary, and explain the reasons supporting the governing body's determination. g.    A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive award agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or other event evidencing project completion that begins the eligibility period indicated in the incentive award agreement.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury.  Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. h.    The incentive award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. i.     The incentive award agreement shall include one or more provisions, as determined by the authority, concerning the terms and conditions for default and the remedies for the developer of a redevelopment project in the event of default.  The incentive award agreement shall not allow the authority to declare a cross-default when the developer of a redevelopment project, including any business affiliate of the developer or any other entity with common principals as the developer, is in default with any other assistance program administered by the authority. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.98, s.6) 5.    (New section)  a.  The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment project approved pursuant to the provisions of the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335), shall be exempt from taxation for a period of five years following the completion of the project.  During that time, the land upon which that project is situated shall remain subject to taxation.  The exemption shall be allowed after the New Jersey Economic Development Authority has certified to the municipal tax assessor of the municipality wherein the property is situated that a permanent certificate of occupancy has been issued to the developer of the redevelopment project. b.    (1)        Before the conclusion of the five-year exemption period set forth in subsection a. of this section, the developer shall enter into a written agreement with the governing body of the municipality wherein the property is situated for the exemption of real property taxation for an additional five-year period, subject to the requirement to provide payments in lieu of tax to the municipality.  The agreement shall provide for the developer to pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount annually to be computed in accordance with this subsection. (2)   During the term of the exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings, improvements, and land of the project, the developer shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit five percent of that revenue to the county.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the developer for the period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (3)   Tax phase-in basis:  the agreement shall provide for the applicant to pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount equal to a percentage of taxes otherwise due, according to the following schedule: (a)   in the first full year, no payment in lieu of taxes otherwise due; (b)   in the second full year, an amount not less than 20 percent of taxes otherwise due; (c)   in the third full year, an amount not less than 40 percent of taxes otherwise due; (d)   in the fourth full year, an amount not less than 60 percent of taxes otherwise due; (e)   in the fifth full year, an amount not less than 80 percent of taxes otherwise due. 6.    Section 5 of P.L.2005, c.29 (C.40:14B-22.3) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  A county, regional or municipal utilities authority shall establish within its rates or schedules a 50% reduction in the connection fee or tapping fee assessed pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-21) for new connections to the water system and a 50% reduction in the connection fee or tapping fee assessed pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-22) for new connections to the sewerage system which are to be charged to public housing authorities, [to] non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, [and to] any other affordable housing, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, and the developers of redevelopment projects approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335). b.    For units previously connected to the authority's system that were demolished or refurbished to allow for new affordable housing units and for which a connection fee was previously paid, a county, regional or municipal utilities authority shall establish within its rates or schedules a credit against the connection fee or tapping fee to be assessed for connection with the water system or the sewerage system to public housing authorities, non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, [and to] any other affordable housing, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, and redevelopment projects approved pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335).  The credit shall be the connection fee or tapping fee previously assessed and paid for connection with the water system or the sewerage system for units previously connected to the authority's system. c.     The connection fee or tapping fee assessable against a public housing authority, non-profit organization, [or] other affordable housing owner, or developer of a redevelopment project approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 and C.34:1B-335), for units previously connected to the authority's system that were demolished or refurbished to allow for new affordable housing units, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, shall be the lesser of the reduced rate provided for in subsection a. of this section, or the current non-reduced rate applicable to other types of housing developments minus the credit provided under subsection b. of this section for units for which a connection fee or tapping fee was previously paid, provided that said public housing authority, non-profit organization, [or] other affordable housing owner, or developer can establish the connection fee or tapping fee was previously assessed and paid for connection with the system.  If the same cannot be established, the reduced rate provided for in subsection a. of this section shall be assessed. (cf:  P.L.2018, c.74, s.6) 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides various changes to the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program), which is administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) and was enacted as part of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.). Under the Aspire Program, the EDA awards tax credits to the developers of certain redevelopment projects, which projects would not be economically feasible absent such subsidies, and which projects meet certain other requirements.  In turn, these developers are required to comply with certain additional requirements concerning the development of these projects, including, but not limited to, the dedication of affordable housing in new residential projects. Government-restricted municipalities The bill revises the definition of government-restricted municipality to expand municipal eligibility to the municipalities of Newark, East Orange, Union City, Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Camden, Vineland, Bridgeton, and Lakewood, in addition to Paterson, Trenton, and Atlantic City. Net benefits analysis and final award certification A developer of a redevelopment project applying for an award of tax credits from the EDA is required to demonstrate that providing public assistance to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  Currently, the EDA requires each applicant to demonstrate a net positive benefit to the State of 160 percent of the credit amount. Under current law, certain redevelopment projects, including those located within government-restricted municipalities, may be approved at the authoritys discretion while having a net positive economic benefit that is as much as 35 percent less than the standard applied to projects in other locations.  This bill would extent this allowance to provide that the EDA may approve projects located in government-restricted municipalities that demonstrate a net positive benefit to the State of up to 50 percentage points less than the standard requirement.  As a result, these projects could be eligible for approval by demonstrating a net positive benefit that is 110 percent of the credit amount. The bill also removes a provision of law that requires the EDA to reduce the overall award of tax credits to a redevelopment project if it is determined, at the time of project certification, that the actual project financing gap is less than the amount initially approved by the EDA. Option of prevailing wages or a project labor agreement Under current law, workers employed to perform construction work at redevelopment projects are required to be paid no less than the prevailing wage for the workers craft or trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.  The bill provides that a developer of a residential redevelopment project may be exempt from this requirement if the developer has negotiated and executed a project labor agreement to provide certain wage protections. Utility authorities and connection fees for redevelopment projects Under current law, county, regional, and municipal utility authorities are required to provide reductions in connection fees for new connections to the water system and sewerage system for certain projects, including public housing authorities, non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, and any other affordable housing projects.  The bill extends this provision of law to require county, regional, and municipal utility authorities to provide the same reductions in connection fees for the developers of redevelopment projects under the Aspire Program. Phased tax abatement for redevelopment projects The bill also provides for tax exemptions on the improvements from redevelopment projects.  Under the bill, for the first five years after a project receives a permanent certificate of occupancy, no tax would be imposed on the improvements on the property. However, the land on which the project is located would continue to be taxed during the first five years.  Following the initial five-year period, the developer would be required to enter into an agreement to pay annual payments in lieu of taxation to the municipality for an additional five-year period. Over the course of this five-year period, the payments by the developer of the project shall increase by 20 percent annually.

(1) For a redevelopment project subject to the requirement of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State equaling an amount determined by the authority through regulation that exceeds the requested tax credit amount.  The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this subsection are true and accurate at the time of submission. (2) A redevelopment project located in a government-restricted municipality shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to [35] 50 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (3) A commercial project that contains 50,000 or more square feet of space devoted to research or technology focused incubator and conferencing facilities for one or more institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations, and which has a total project cost of not less than $50 million, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (4) A redevelopment project that is predominantly commercial and that receives a federal historic rehabilitation tax credit pursuant to section 47 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.47, or a tax credit pursuant to the "Historic Property Reinvestment Act," sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through 34:1B-276), shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (5) A commercial project that is located on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005 shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (6) A redevelopment project that is undertaken by a major cultural institution to renovate existing space or expand services into additional space, and in which the major cultural institution realizes all returns from the redevelopment project, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. e.     If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive award. f.     If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.98, s.4) 4.    Section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328) is amended to read as follows: 60.  a.  (1)  Following approval and selection of an application pursuant to sections 58 and 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-326 and C.34:1B-327), the authority shall enter into an incentive award agreement with the developer.  The chief executive officer of the authority shall negotiate the terms and conditions of the incentive award agreement on behalf of the State. (2)   For a phased project, the incentive phase agreement shall set forth, for each phase of the project and for the total project, the capital investment requirements and the time periods in which each phase of the project shall be commenced and completed. The awarding of tax credits shall be conditioned on the developer's compliance with the requirements of the agreement.  A redevelopment project may be completed in phases in accordance with rules adopted by the authority if the redevelopment project has a total project cost in excess of $50,000,000. b.    An incentive award agreement shall specify the amount of the incentive award the authority shall award to the developer and the duration of the eligibility period.  The duration of the eligibility period shall not exceed 15 years for a commercial or mixed-use project and shall not exceed 10 years for a residential project, except that to reduce the total value of tax credits needed to reimburse a developer for all or part of the project financing gap of a redevelopment project, the authority may, in its discretion, approve a duration for the eligibility period that is shorter than the applicable maximum periods.  The incentive award agreement shall provide an estimated date of completion and include a requirement for periodic progress reports, including the submittal of executed financing commitments and documents that evidence site control.  If the authority does not receive periodic progress reports, or if the progress reports demonstrate unsatisfactory progress, then the authority may rescind the incentive award.  If the authority rescinds an incentive award in the same calendar year in which the authority approved the incentive award, then the authority may assign the incentive award to another applicant.  The incentive award agreement may also provide for a verification of the financing gap at the time the developer provides executed financing commitments to the authority and a verification of the developer's projected cash flow at the time of certification that the project is completed. c.     [To ensure the protection of taxpayer money, if the authority determines at project certification that the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project has resulted in a financing gap that is smaller than the financing gap determined at board approval, the authority shall reduce the amount of the tax credit or accept payment from the developer on a pro rata basis.  If there is no project financing gap due to the actual capital financing approach utilized by the project, then the developer shall forfeit the incentive award.  At the end of the seventh year of the eligibility period, the authority shall evaluate the developer's rate of return on investment and compare that rate of return on investment to the reasonable and appropriate rate of return at the time of board approval.  If the actual rate of return on investment exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment at the time of board approval by more than 15 percent, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount in excess of the reasonable and appropriate rate of return on investment.  The authority shall require an escrow account to be held by the authority until the end of the eligibility period.  Following the final year of the eligibility period, the authority shall determine if the developer's rate of return exceeded the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval.  If the final rate of return does not exceed the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall release to the developer the escrowed funds.  If the project final rate of return exceeds the reasonable and appropriate rate of return determined at board approval, the authority shall require the developer to pay up to 20 percent of the amount of the excess, which shall include the funds held in escrow, and such funds shall be deposited in the State General Fund.] (Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) d.    The incentive award agreement shall include a requirement that the authority confirm with the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action for the developer, and the developer shall confirm that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the redevelopment project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The incentive award agreement shall also include a provision that the developer shall forfeit the incentive award in any year in which the developer is neither in substantial good standing with each department nor has entered into a practical corrective action.  The incentive award agreement shall also require a developer to engage in on-site consultations with the Division of Workplace Safety and Health in the Department of Health. e.     (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the authority shall not enter into an incentive award agreement for a redevelopment project that includes at least one retail establishment which will have more than 10 employees, at least one distribution center which will have more than 20 employees, or at least one hospitality establishment which will have more than 10 employees, unless the incentive award agreement includes a precondition that any business that serves as the owner or operator of the retail establishment, distribution center, or hospitality establishment enters into a labor harmony agreement with a labor organization or cooperating labor organizations which represent retail establishment, hospitality establishment, or distribution center employees in the State. (2)   A labor harmony agreement shall be required only if the State has a proprietary interest in the redevelopment project and shall remain in effect for as long as the State acts as a market participant in the redevelopment project.  The authority may enter into an incentive award agreement with a developer without the labor harmony agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection if the authority determines that the redevelopment project would not be able to go forward if a labor harmony agreement is required.  The authority shall support the determination by a written finding, which provides the specific basis for the determination. (3)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2023, c.98) f.     (1)  Except for a residential project that is located in a government-restricted municipality, and in which 100 percent of the residential units constructed in the residential project are reserved for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households, for a redevelopment project whose total project cost equals or exceeds $10 million, in addition to the incentive award agreement, a developer shall enter into a community benefits agreement with the authority and the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located.  The agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements for training, employment, and youth development and free services to underserved communities in and around the community in which the redevelopment project is located. Prior to entering a community benefits agreement, the governing body of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located shall hold at least one public hearing at which the governing body shall hear testimony from residents, community groups, and other stakeholders on the needs of the community that the agreement should address. (2)   The community benefits agreement shall provide for the creation of a community advisory committee to oversee the implementation of the agreement, monitor successes, ensure compliance with the terms of the agreement, and produce an annual public report.  The community advisory committee created pursuant to this paragraph shall be comprised of representatives of diverse community groups and residents of the county or municipality in which the redevelopment project is located. (3)   At the time the developer submits the annual report required pursuant to section 62 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330) to the authority, the developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that it is in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement.  If the developer fails to provide the certification required pursuant to this paragraph or the authority determines that the developer is not in compliance with the terms of the community benefits agreement based on the reports submitted by the community advisory committee pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, then the authority may rescind an award or recapture all or part of any tax credits awarded. (4)   Notwithstanding any requirement of this subsection to the contrary, a developer shall be considered to have met the requirements of a community benefits agreement pursuant to this subsection if the developer submits to the authority: (a)   a copy of either the developer's approval letter from the authority or a redevelopment agreement applicable to the qualified business facility, provided that the approval letter or redevelopment agreement is certified by the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, and includes provisions that meet or exceed the standards required for a community benefits agreement in this subsection, as determined by the chief executive officer pursuant to rules adopted by the authority; or       (b) a resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality in which the redevelopment project is located, which resolution shall be adopted after at least one public hearing at which the governing body provides an opportunity for residents, community groups, and other stakeholders to testify, and which resolution shall state that the governing body has determined that the redevelopment project will provide economic and social benefits to the community that fulfill the purposes of this subsection, which benefits render a separate community benefit agreement unnecessary, and explain the reasons supporting the governing body's determination. g.    A developer shall submit, prior to the first disbursement of tax credits under the incentive award agreement, but no later than six months following project completion, satisfactory evidence of actual project costs, as certified by a certified public accountant, evidence of a temporary certificate of occupancy, or other event evidencing project completion that begins the eligibility period indicated in the incentive award agreement.  The developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify that the information provided pursuant to this subsection is true under the penalty of perjury.  Claims, records, or statements submitted by a developer to the authority in order to receive tax credits shall not be considered claims, records, or statements made in connection with State tax laws. h.    The incentive award agreement shall include a provision allowing the authority to extend, in individual cases, the deadline for any annual reporting or certification requirement. i.     The incentive award agreement shall include one or more provisions, as determined by the authority, concerning the terms and conditions for default and the remedies for the developer of a redevelopment project in the event of default.  The incentive award agreement shall not allow the authority to declare a cross-default when the developer of a redevelopment project, including any business affiliate of the developer or any other entity with common principals as the developer, is in default with any other assistance program administered by the authority. (cf:  P.L.2023, c.98, s.6) 5.    (New section)  a.  The rehabilitation or improvements made in the development or redevelopment of a redevelopment project approved pursuant to the provisions of the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335), shall be exempt from taxation for a period of five years following the completion of the project.  During that time, the land upon which that project is situated shall remain subject to taxation.  The exemption shall be allowed after the New Jersey Economic Development Authority has certified to the municipal tax assessor of the municipality wherein the property is situated that a permanent certificate of occupancy has been issued to the developer of the redevelopment project. b.    (1)        Before the conclusion of the five-year exemption period set forth in subsection a. of this section, the developer shall enter into a written agreement with the governing body of the municipality wherein the property is situated for the exemption of real property taxation for an additional five-year period, subject to the requirement to provide payments in lieu of tax to the municipality.  The agreement shall provide for the developer to pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount annually to be computed in accordance with this subsection. (2)   During the term of the exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings, improvements, and land of the project, the developer shall make payment to the municipality of an annual service charge, which shall remit five percent of that revenue to the county.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the project to be paid by the developer for the period of exemption, shall be determined as follows: (3)   Tax phase-in basis:  the agreement shall provide for the applicant to pay to the municipality in lieu of full property tax payments an amount equal to a percentage of taxes otherwise due, according to the following schedule: (a)   in the first full year, no payment in lieu of taxes otherwise due; (b)   in the second full year, an amount not less than 20 percent of taxes otherwise due; (c)   in the third full year, an amount not less than 40 percent of taxes otherwise due; (d)   in the fourth full year, an amount not less than 60 percent of taxes otherwise due; (e)   in the fifth full year, an amount not less than 80 percent of taxes otherwise due. 6.    Section 5 of P.L.2005, c.29 (C.40:14B-22.3) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  A county, regional or municipal utilities authority shall establish within its rates or schedules a 50% reduction in the connection fee or tapping fee assessed pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-21) for new connections to the water system and a 50% reduction in the connection fee or tapping fee assessed pursuant to section 22 of P.L.1957, c.183 (C.40:14B-22) for new connections to the sewerage system which are to be charged to public housing authorities, [to] non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, [and to] any other affordable housing, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, and the developers of redevelopment projects approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335). b.    For units previously connected to the authority's system that were demolished or refurbished to allow for new affordable housing units and for which a connection fee was previously paid, a county, regional or municipal utilities authority shall establish within its rates or schedules a credit against the connection fee or tapping fee to be assessed for connection with the water system or the sewerage system to public housing authorities, non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, [and to] any other affordable housing, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, and redevelopment projects approved pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 through C.34:1B-335).  The credit shall be the connection fee or tapping fee previously assessed and paid for connection with the water system or the sewerage system for units previously connected to the authority's system. c.     The connection fee or tapping fee assessable against a public housing authority, non-profit organization, [or] other affordable housing owner, or developer of a redevelopment project approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority pursuant to the New Jersey Aspire Program Act, sections 54 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-322 and C.34:1B-335), for units previously connected to the authority's system that were demolished or refurbished to allow for new affordable housing units, including affordable housing units in inclusionary projects, shall be the lesser of the reduced rate provided for in subsection a. of this section, or the current non-reduced rate applicable to other types of housing developments minus the credit provided under subsection b. of this section for units for which a connection fee or tapping fee was previously paid, provided that said public housing authority, non-profit organization, [or] other affordable housing owner, or developer can establish the connection fee or tapping fee was previously assessed and paid for connection with the system.  If the same cannot be established, the reduced rate provided for in subsection a. of this section shall be assessed. (cf:  P.L.2018, c.74, s.6) 7.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill provides various changes to the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program), which is administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) and was enacted as part of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.). Under the Aspire Program, the EDA awards tax credits to the developers of certain redevelopment projects, which projects would not be economically feasible absent such subsidies, and which projects meet certain other requirements.  In turn, these developers are required to comply with certain additional requirements concerning the development of these projects, including, but not limited to, the dedication of affordable housing in new residential projects. Government-restricted municipalities The bill revises the definition of government-restricted municipality to expand municipal eligibility to the municipalities of Newark, East Orange, Union City, Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Camden, Vineland, Bridgeton, and Lakewood, in addition to Paterson, Trenton, and Atlantic City. Net benefits analysis and final award certification A developer of a redevelopment project applying for an award of tax credits from the EDA is required to demonstrate that providing public assistance to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  Currently, the EDA requires each applicant to demonstrate a net positive benefit to the State of 160 percent of the credit amount. Under current law, certain redevelopment projects, including those located within government-restricted municipalities, may be approved at the authoritys discretion while having a net positive economic benefit that is as much as 35 percent less than the standard applied to projects in other locations.  This bill would extent this allowance to provide that the EDA may approve projects located in government-restricted municipalities that demonstrate a net positive benefit to the State of up to 50 percentage points less than the standard requirement.  As a result, these projects could be eligible for approval by demonstrating a net positive benefit that is 110 percent of the credit amount. The bill also removes a provision of law that requires the EDA to reduce the overall award of tax credits to a redevelopment project if it is determined, at the time of project certification, that the actual project financing gap is less than the amount initially approved by the EDA. Option of prevailing wages or a project labor agreement Under current law, workers employed to perform construction work at redevelopment projects are required to be paid no less than the prevailing wage for the workers craft or trade, as determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.  The bill provides that a developer of a residential redevelopment project may be exempt from this requirement if the developer has negotiated and executed a project labor agreement to provide certain wage protections. Utility authorities and connection fees for redevelopment projects Under current law, county, regional, and municipal utility authorities are required to provide reductions in connection fees for new connections to the water system and sewerage system for certain projects, including public housing authorities, non-profit organizations building affordable housing projects, and any other affordable housing projects.  The bill extends this provision of law to require county, regional, and municipal utility authorities to provide the same reductions in connection fees for the developers of redevelopment projects under the Aspire Program. Phased tax abatement for redevelopment projects The bill also provides for tax exemptions on the improvements from redevelopment projects.  Under the bill, for the first five years after a project receives a permanent certificate of occupancy, no tax would be imposed on the improvements on the property. However, the land on which the project is located would continue to be taxed during the first five years.  Following the initial five-year period, the developer would be required to enter into an agreement to pay annual payments in lieu of taxation to the municipality for an additional five-year period. Over the course of this five-year period, the payments by the developer of the project shall increase by 20 percent annually.
