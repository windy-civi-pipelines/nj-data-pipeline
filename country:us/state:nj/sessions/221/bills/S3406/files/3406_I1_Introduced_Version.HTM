developer shall include in all commercial leases or other commercial occupancy
agreements, and shall require that all subleases or other commercial occupancy
agreements applicable to the redevelopment project include, a provision setting
forth the requirements of this subparagraph, which provision shall be in a form
acceptable to the authority.  Notwithstanding any provisions of law to the
contrary, if a commercial tenant, commercial subtenant, or other commercial
occupant violates this provision due to the underpayment of the required
prevailing wage rate, then the issuance of tax credits to the developer and any
co-applicant shall be delayed until such time as documentation demonstrating
compliance has been provided to the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce
Development, subsequently reviewed and approved by the Commissioner of Labor

credits otherwise authorized for the tax period in which the notice of
violation was issued.  If the violation is not cured on or before the
conclusion of that tax period, the developer and any co-applicant shall forfeit
up to 100 percent of the tax credits otherwise authorized, as determined by the
authority, in each subsequent tax period until the first tax period for which
documentation demonstrating compliance has been provided to the Commissioner of
Labor and Workforce Development, subsequently reviewed and approved by the
Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, and verified by the authority,
which reviews and verifications shall be completed.  In this event, the
developer and any co-applicant shall be allowed the full tax credit amount beginning

following the completion of the project.  During that time, the land upon which
that project is situated shall remain subject to taxation.  The exemption shall
be allowed after the New Jersey Economic Development Authority has certified to
the municipal tax assessor of the municipality wherein the property is situated
that a permanent certificate of occupancy has been issued to the developer of
the redevelopment project.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    (1)        Before the
conclusion of the five-year exemption period set forth in subsection a. of this
section, the developer shall enter into a written agreement with the governing
body of the municipality wherein the property is situated for the exemption of
real property taxation for an additional five-year period, subject to the
requirement to provide payments in lieu of tax to the municipality.  The
agreement shall provide for the developer to pay to the municipality in lieu of
full property tax payments an amount annually to be computed in accordance with
this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   During the term of the
exemption, in lieu of any taxes to be paid on the buildings, improvements, and
land of the project, the developer shall make payment to the municipality of an
annual service charge, which shall remit five percent of that revenue to the
county.  In addition, the municipality may assess an administrative fee, not to
exceed two percent of the annual service charge, for the processing of the
application.  The annual service charge for municipal services supplied to the
project to be paid by the developer for the period of exemption, shall be
determined as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Tax phase-in basis:  the
agreement shall provide for the applicant to pay to the municipality in lieu of
full property tax payments an amount equal to a percentage of taxes otherwise
due, according to the following schedule:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   in the first full year,
no payment in lieu of taxes otherwise due;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   in the second full year,
an amount not less than 20 percent of taxes otherwise due;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   in the third full year,
an amount not less than 40 percent of taxes otherwise due;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   in the fourth full year,
an amount not less than 60 percent of taxes otherwise due;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   in the fifth full year,
an amount not less than 80 percent of taxes otherwise due.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    This act shall take
effect immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides various
changes to the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program), which is
administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) and was
enacted as part of the New Jersey Economic Recovery Act of 2020, P.L.2020,
c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the Aspire Program, the
EDA awards tax credits to the developers of certain redevelopment projects,
which projects would not be economically feasible absent such subsidies, and
which projects meet certain other requirements.  In turn, these developers are
required to comply with certain additional requirements concerning the
development of these projects, including, but not limited to, the dedication of
affordable housing in new residential projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Government-restricted municipalities</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the
definition of government-restricted municipality to expand municipal
eligibility to the municipalities of Newark, East Orange, Union City,
Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Camden, Vineland, Bridgeton, and Lakewood, in
addition to Paterson, Trenton, and Atlantic City.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Net benefits analysis and final
award certification</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A developer of a redevelopment
project applying for an award of tax credits from the EDA is required to
demonstrate that providing public assistance to the project will result in a
net positive benefit to the State.  Currently, the EDA requires each applicant
to demonstrate a net positive benefit to the State of 160 percent of the credit
amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, certain
redevelopment projects, including those located within government-restricted
municipalities, may be approved at the authoritys discretion while having a
net positive economic benefit that is as much as 35 percent less than the
standard applied to projects in other locations.  This bill would extent this
allowance to provide that the EDA may approve projects located in
government-restricted municipalities that demonstrate a net positive benefit to
the State of up to 50 percentage points less than the standard requirement.  As
a result, these projects could be eligible for approval by demonstrating a net
positive benefit that is 110 percent of the credit amount.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also removes a
provision of law that requires the EDA to reduce the overall award of tax
credits to a redevelopment project if it is determined, at the time of project
certification, that the actual project financing gap is less than the amount
initially approved by the EDA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Option of prevailing wages or a
project labor agreement</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, workers
employed to perform construction work at redevelopment projects are required to
be paid no less than the prevailing wage for the workers craft or trade, as
determined by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development.  The bill
provides that a developer of a residential redevelopment project may be exempt
from this requirement if the developer has negotiated and executed a project
labor agreement to provide certain wage protections. <br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Utility authorities and
connection fees for redevelopment projects</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, county,
regional, and municipal utility authorities are required to provide reductions
in connection fees for new connections to the water system and sewerage system
for certain projects, including public housing authorities, non-profit
organizations building affordable housing projects, and any other affordable
housing projects.  The bill extends this provision of law to require county,
regional, and municipal utility authorities to provide the same reductions in
connection fees for the developers of redevelopment projects under the Aspire
Program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Phased tax abatement for
redevelopment projects</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides for tax
exemptions on the improvements from redevelopment projects.  Under the bill,
for the first five years after a project receives a permanent certificate of
occupancy, no tax would be imposed on the improvements on the property. 
However, the land on which the project is located would continue to be taxed
during the first five years.  Following the initial five-year period, the
developer would be required to enter into an agreement to pay annual payments
in lieu of taxation to the municipality for an additional five-year period. 
Over the course of this five-year period, the payments by the developer of the
project shall increase by 20 percent annually.</p>
