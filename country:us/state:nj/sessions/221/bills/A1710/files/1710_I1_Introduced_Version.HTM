provided in section 16 of this act, or section 1 of P.L.2013, c.7 (C.9:2-12.1)
concerning a service member's absence due to a deployment or service-related
treatment as set forth in that section, a court of this State has jurisdiction
to make an initial child custody determination only if:</p>

proceeding and the child is absent from this State but a parent or person
acting as a parent continues to live in this State;</p>

does not have jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or a court
of the home state of the child has declined to exercise jurisdiction on the
ground that this State is the more appropriate forum under section 19 or 20 of
this act and:</p>

parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent
have a significant connection with this State other than mere physical
presence; and</p>

available in this State concerning the child's care, protection, training and
personal relationships;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   all courts having
jurisdiction under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection have declined to

a more appropriate forum.  The issue of inconvenient forum may be raised upon
the court's own motion, request of another court or motion of a party.</p>

it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this State shall consider whether it is
appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.  For this
purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall
consider all relevant factors, including:</p>

of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to
present the evidence; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8) the familiarity of the
court of each state with the facts and issues of the pending litigation.</p>

determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state

a child custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another designated state

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  A court of this State may
decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this act if a child custody

exercise its jurisdiction unless:</p>

under sections 13 through 15 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  If a court dismisses a

costs, communication expenses, attorney's fees, investigative fees, expenses
for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care during the course of the
proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the
award would be inappropriate.  The court may not assess fees, costs, or

act.   No fees, costs or expenses shall be assessed against a party who is
fleeing an incident or pattern of domestic violence or mistreatment or abuse of

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes certain
protections for persons who provide, receive, or allow a child to receive
gender-affirming health care.  As defined in the bill, gender-affirming care means
care that focuses on a transgender persons physical, mental, and social health
needs and well-being while confirming the persons gender identity, including

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill amends
P.L.2004, c.187 (C.2A:34-53 et seq.), the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction
and Enforcement Act to stipulate that: 1) the presence of the child in this
State for the purpose of receiving gender-affirming health care is sufficient for
a State court to have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody
determination for a child, if the child and the child's parents, or the child
and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a significant
connection with this State other than mere physical presence (section 13 of
P.L.2004, c.147 (C.2A:34-65)); 2) a court of this State has temporary emergency
jurisdiction if the child is present in this State and the child is unable to
receive gender-affirming health care in the childs home state (section 16 of
P.L.2004, c.147 (C. 2A:34-68)); 3) a court of this State is the appropriate
forum to exercise jurisdiction in a child custody case when the law or policy
of the other state that may take jurisdiction limits the ability of a parent to
obtain gender-affirming health care for a child (section 19 of P.L.2004, c.147
(C.2A:34-71)); and 4) in making a determination about whether a court in this
State can decline to exercise its jurisdiction over a child custody case, the
court cannot consider the taking or keeping of the child from the person who
has legal or physical custody or visitation rights as a factor weighing against
a petitioner in the case, if there is evidence that taking or keeping the child
was so that the child could receive gender-affirming health care (section 20 of
P.L.2004, c.147 (C.2A:34-72)).</p>

extradition with providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive
gender-affirming health care that is permitted under the laws of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bills provisions, an

providing, receiving, or allowing a child to receive gender-affirming health
care that is permitted under the laws of this State.</p>

or jurisdictions law against a person providing, receiving, or allowing a

health care cannot be enforced by a court of this State.</p>

(C.26:3H-2 et seq.) and a health care professional licensed pursuant to Title
45 or Title 52 of the Revised Statutes from providing the medical records of
any child seeking or receiving gender-affirming health care in furtherance of
any interstate investigation or proceeding, based on another states law,
seeking to impose civil or criminal liability upon a person or entity for: 1)
the provision, receipt, or seeking of, or inquiring or responding to an inquiry

any child seeking or receiving gender-affirming health care in the furtherance
of an investigation or proceeding if the conduct subject to potential liability
under the investigation or proceeding would be subject to liability under New
Jersey law if committed in New Jersey, or if the provision of such medical
records is necessary for a person to engage in conduct otherwise prohibited by
the bill in order to comply with a valid order issued by a court with
jurisdiction over the person, or to comply with applicable provisions of State
