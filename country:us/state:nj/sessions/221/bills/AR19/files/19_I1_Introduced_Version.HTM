AR19 ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION No. 19 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblyman  MICHAEL INGANAMORT District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) Assemblywoman  DAWN FANTASIA District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Constitutes special committee of General Assembly entitled Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution constituting a special committee of the General Assembly entitled the Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Whereas, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has developed into a global pandemic, with nearly 360 million cases and more than 5.7 million deaths reported worldwide as of January 2022; and Whereas, Efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in the implementation of sweeping emergency measures by the executive branch of the government of New Jersey, including issuing stay-at-home orders, limiting social contact, closing non-essential businesses, suspending elective surgeries, expanding the health care workforce, delaying tax collections and adoption of the FY 2021 budget, and directing the allocation and use of scarce resources such as personal protective equipment and ventilators; and Whereas, COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the lives of every resident of this State.  Many New Jersey families have experienced firsthand the effects of furloughs and layoffs, the stresses of prolonged social isolation, and the pain of preventable illnesses and deaths; and Whereas, It is anticipated that COVID-19 will have lasting deleterious effects on the State economy as both New Jersey and the nation struggle to address lost revenues, the costs of the COVID-19 response, widespread upticks in unemployment claims, and the lasting toll of the disease on first responders, health care workers, and the health care industry, as well as to other commercial and social sectors; and Whereas, It is incumbent on this House to examine the executive branchs response to the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the successes and deficiencies in that response and develop policies and strategies to ensure the State is fully prepared for future outbreaks of infectious disease, as well as other Statewide events that may result in a prolonged emergency response; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    There is constituted a special committee of the General Assembly entitled the Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, comprising six members of the General Assembly.  Three members shall be appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, and three members shall be appointed by the Minority Leader of the General Assembly, with no more than three members being from a single political party.  The Speaker of the General Assembly shall select a chairperson and vice-chairperson from among the members.  The chairperson and vice-chairperson shall not be from the same political party. 2.    The Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic shall evaluate the executive branchs response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and develop strategies to improve the States response to future outbreaks of infectious disease and other Statewide events that may result in a prolonged emergency response.  For the purposes of carrying out its charge under this resolution, the special committee shall have all the powers conferred under the laws and the Constitutions of the State of New Jersey and of the United States, including, but not limited to, the following powers, provided that no subpoena shall be issued by the special committee without the written consent of the chairperson, the vice-chairperson, and the Speaker of the General Assembly: a.     the powers conferred pursuant to chapter 13 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, including, but not limited to, the power to issue subpoenas to compel attendance and testimony of persons and the production of  books, papers, correspondence, other documents and materials, and electronic records and data;

The Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic shall be entitled to call to its assistance and avail itself of the services of the employees of the State of New Jersey, any political subdivision of the State, and any agency thereof, as may be required and as may be available for that purpose, and to employ any other services as may be deemed necessary, in order to perform the duties provided herein, and within the limits of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for that purpose. b.    The Assembly Select Committee on the Executive Branchs Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, upon the written approval of the Speaker of the General Assembly, shall be entitled to call to its assistance, employ, and avail itself of the services of one or more special counsel retained to assist the committee. 4.    This resolution shall take effect immediately.
