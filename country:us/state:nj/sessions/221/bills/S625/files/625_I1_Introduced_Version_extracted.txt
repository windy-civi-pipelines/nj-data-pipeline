Section 1:
S625 SENATE, No. 625 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  LATHAM TIVER District 8 (Atlantic and Burlington) SYNOPSIS Requires MVC to authorize use of third-party vendors in administration of commercial driver license testing. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning commercial driver licenses and amending P.L.1990, c.103. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 13 of P.L.1990, c.103 (C.39:3-10.21) is amended to read as follows: 13.  [Within one year of the effective date of P.L.2017, c.10 (C.39:3-10.21a et al.) the] To the extent permitted by federal law, the chief administrator shall, by contract, by appointment as a motor vehicle agent, or by licensing, authorize any necessary persons, including, but not limited to, an agency of this or another state, an employer, a private driver training facility or other private institution, or a department, agency or instrumentality of local government, to administer the knowledge or skills tests for a commercial driver license or endorsement.  [The appointments shall be based on the evaluation of the pilot program and recommendations submitted to the Governor pursuant to P.L.2017, c.10 (C.39:3-10.21a et al.).] The chief administrator shall adopt regulations necessary to establish, oversee, and regulate the administration of commercial motor vehicle driver testing by third parties including establishment of maximum fees that may be charged.  The maximum fee for a skills test administered by a third party shall be set at an amount equal to the cost to the State for administering the testing. The chief administrator [may limit the number of persons licensed to administer examinations and] may suspend or revoke an authorization on any reasonable ground.  A person authorized to administer examinations by appointment as a motor vehicle agent shall so act until this authority is revoked by the chief administrator. An examiner administering a skills test shall not be held accountable for any violation of Title 39 of the Revised Statutes committed by the person being tested. (cf: P.L.2017, c.10, s.2) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) to authorize third-party vendors to administer the knowledge or skills tests for commercial driver license applicants. In 2017, the State enacted legislation to establish the Commercial Driver License Testing Pilot Program. Under the pilot program, the MVC was required to appoint three private third-party vendors to administer the knowledge and skills tests for commercial driver license applicants.  Moreover, based on the chief administrators evaluation of the pilot program, the MVC was required to authorize other third-party vendors to administer these tests.  However, although the MVC issued a series of Requests for Quote to solicit participating vendors, the MVC does not appear to have implemented the pilot program. In response, this bill amends current law to clarify that the MVC is required to authorize the use of third-party vendors in the administration of commercial driver license testing. Notably, the appointment of third-party vendors would no longer be based on the evaluation of the Commercial Driver License Testing Pilot Program. Additionally, the bill removes a provision of existing law that allows the chief administrator to limit the number of third-party vendors that may administer tests throughout the State.
