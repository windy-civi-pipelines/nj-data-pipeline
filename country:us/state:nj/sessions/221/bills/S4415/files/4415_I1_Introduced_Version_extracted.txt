For the purposes of this section, "receiving" means acquiring possession, control or title, or lending on the security of the motor vehicle. d.    (1)  A violation of this section is a crime of the second degree if a person has been convicted of, or adjudicated delinquent for, such crime, regardless of the value of the vehicle, on two or more prior and separate occasions during the 15 year period preceding the most recent violation.  Any subsequent conviction of such crime shall also be a crime of the second degree. (2)   Except as provided in paragraph (3), and notwithstanding section 3 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.3), a person convicted of a violation of this section on two or more prior and separate occasions during the 15 year period preceding the most recent violation shall be sentenced by the court to a mandatory minimum period of parole ineligibility pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.117 (C.2C:43-7.2).

(cf: P.L.2023, c.101, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    Persistent stolen motor vehicle offender sentencing. a.     [Upon] Except as provided in subsection d. of section 2 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.2), upon request of the prosecutor, a person who has been convicted of a crime pursuant to section 1 or 2 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.1 or 2C:20-10.2) or carjacking pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.221 (C.2C:15-2) shall be sentenced to an extended term of imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:43-7 if the person has previously been convicted on two or more prior and separate occasions, regardless of the dates of the convictions, of a crime pursuant to section 1 or 2 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.1 or 2C:20-10.2), carjacking pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.221 (C.2C:15-2), theft or unlawful taking of a motor vehicle, receiving stolen property where the property involved is a motor vehicle, or a crime under any statute of the United States, this State, or any other state for a crime that is substantially equivalent to any of the crimes enumerated in this subsection. b.    The provisions of this section shall not apply unless the prior convictions are for crimes committed on a separate occasion and the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced was committed either: (1) within 10 years of the date of the defendant's last release from confinement for the commission of any crime; or (2) within 10 years of the date of the commission of the most recent of the crimes enumerated in subsection a. of this section for which the defendant has a prior conviction. c.     The court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment pursuant to this section, unless the ground therefor has been established at a hearing after the conviction of the defendant and on written notice to the defendant of the ground proposed.  The defendant shall have the right to hear and controvert the evidence against him and to offer evidence upon the issue.  Prior convictions shall be defined and proven in accordance with N.J.S.2C:44-4.

(cf: P.L.2024, c.83, s.8) 4.    (New section)  The Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part shall waive jurisdiction of a juvenile delinquency case to an appropriate court and prosecuting authority without consent of the juvenile if: a.     the juvenile is charged with an offense which, if committed by an adult, would constitute receiving a stolen motor vehicle pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2023, c.101 (C.2C:20-10.2); and b.    the juvenile has been adjudicated delinquent of such offense on two or more prior and separate occasions, regardless of the value of the motor vehicle. 5. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill establishes a second degree crime for certain individuals who are convicted or adjudicated delinquent of a third offense for receipt of a stolen motor vehicle, N.J.S.A.2C:20-10.2. Under the bill, a person who commits the crime of receiving a stolen motor vehicle on two or more prior and separate occasions during the 15-year-period preceding the most recent charge is guilty of a crime of the second degree.  The bill provides that a conviction for such crime is subject to the No Early Release Act, which requires that a defendant serve 85% of the sentence, during which time the defendant is not eligible for parole. A second degree crime is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both. Moreover, the bill establishes that a juvenile court is required to waive jurisdiction of a juvenile who commits a delinquent act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute receiving a stolen motor vehicle on two or more prior and separate occasions. The bill clarifies that on the third or subsequent violation committed by a juvenile, the court may sentence the juvenile to a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment.  However, if the individual is an adult when committing the third or subsequent violation, the individual shall be subject to the enhanced sentencing under the bill.
