Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Race is a social
construct with no biological basis that artificially divides people into
distinct groups based on characteristics such as physical appearance, ancestral
heritage, cultural affiliation, and the social, economic, and political needs
of a society at a given period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Racism is a social
system with multiple dimensions that include individual racism that is
internalized or interpersonal, systemic racism that is institutional or
structural, and a system of structuring opportunity and assigning value based
on the social interpretation of how one looks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Racism unfairly
disadvantages specific individuals and communities while giving unfair
advantages to other individuals and communities, which undermines society as a
whole through the waste of human resources necessary to promote prosperity and
development in New Jersey and elsewhere.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Racism is rooted in the
foundation of America, from the time chattel slavery began in the 1600s, to the
Jim Crow era, to the declaration of the war on drugs that eventually led to the
mass incarceration of Black people, and it has remained a presence in American
society that causes Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other peoples of
color to experience hardships and disadvantages in every aspect of life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     The American Public
Health Association, the National Association of County and City Health
Officials, and the American Academy of Pediatrics have each declared racism to
be a public health crisis, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and
prevention has declared racism to be a serious public health threat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Communities of color,
working class residents, and individuals with disabilities are more likely to
experience poor health outcomes as a consequence of their social determinants
of health.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    Racism causes permanent
discrimination and disparate outcomes in many areas of life, including housing,
education, employment, criminal justice and incarceration, family stability,
economic opportunity, access to health care, public safety, environmental
safety, nutrition, voting rights, access to recreational resources, and access
to health care resources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    More than 100 studies
have linked racism to worse health outcomes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     Racism exacerbates
health disparities among Black, Hispanic, and Native American residents,
including disparities in the risk of heart disease, stroke, infant mortality,
maternal mortality, low birth weight, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
cancer, respiratory disease, and autoimmune disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     Specific physical and
behavioral health conditions stemming from racism include depression, anxiety,
anger, fear, trauma, terror, and long-term physical and mental health
impairments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    The COVID-19 pandemic
and ongoing protests against police brutality have helped to highlight that
racism, not race, causes disparities in health and access to health care for
Americans of color.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     It is therefore
necessary and appropriate to establish a permanent New Jersey Commission on
Health Equity to develop strategies to counter and mitigate the effects of
institutional racism in New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Advisory committee means the
Health Equity Data Advisory Committee established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Carrier&quot; means an
insurance company, health service corporation, hospital service corporation, medical
service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to issue
health benefits plans in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commission means the New
Jersey Commission on Health Equity established pursuant to section 3 of P.L.

plan&quot; means a benefits plan which pays or provides hospital and medical
expense benefits for covered services, and is delivered or issued for delivery
in this State by or through a carrier.  Health benefits plan includes, but is
not limited to, Medicare supplement coverage and risk contracts to the extent
not otherwise prohibited by federal law.  For the purposes of P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
