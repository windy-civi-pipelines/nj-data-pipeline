(cf: P.L.2001, c.281, s.6) 12.  Section 28 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.28) is amended to read as follows: 28.

(cf: P.L.2009, c.90, s.45) 13.  (New section) a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a board of trustees of a county college may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board and subject to subsections b. and c. of this section, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder or the responsible bidder whose bid would otherwise be determined to be most advantageous to the county college, as applicable, if the board finds that a board of a public institution of higher education in the State has had prior negative experience with the bidder within the past 15 years. b.    As used in this section, "prior negative experience" means any of the following: (1) the bidder has been found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have: failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a prior contract with a public institution of higher education; (2) the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a public institution of higher education to utilize the services of another contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or complete the contract; (3) the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a public institution of higher education to look to the bidder's surety for completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; or (4) the bidder is debarred or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award, whether or not the action was based on experience with a public institution of higher education. c.     The following conditions shall apply if the county college is contemplating a disqualification based on prior negative experience: (1)   The existence of any of the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not require that a bidder be disqualified.  In each instance, the decision to disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the county college and shall be rendered in the best interests of the county college. (2)   All mitigating factors shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted. (3)   The bidder shall be furnished by the county college with a written notice (a) stating that a disqualification is being considered; (b) setting forth the reason for the disqualification; and (c) indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing before the county college if the bidder so requests within a stated period of time.  At the hearing, the bidder shall show good cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and testimony.  If the county college determines that good cause has not been shown by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and, thus, disqualified. (4)   Disqualification shall be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years. (5)   A disqualification, other than a disqualification pursuant to which a county college is prohibited by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period thereof may be reduced, at the discretion of the county college, upon the submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, including reversal of a judgment or actual change of ownership, management, or control of the bidder. (6) An opportunity for a hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey.  The term of [such a] the disqualification shall be concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or department. 14.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to the County College Contracts Law. The public bid threshold for county colleges is currently $41,600. Under current law, the threshold is adjusted every two years by the Governor, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, in direct proportion to the rise or fall of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers in New York and Northeastern New Jersey and the Philadelphia areas, as reported by the United States Department of Labor. This bill raises the threshold to $100,000 for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not paid in accordance to the "New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. The threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are paid in accordance with the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act remains unchanged. Both thresholds will continue to be adjusted by the Governor every two years in the same manner. This bill revises the law that enumerates numerous exemptions to the requirement for public advertising and bidding to also include: (1) the use of electronic data or media services for the publication of legal notices; (2) the production and reproduction of printed materials in electronic and digital formats; (3) information technology; (4) the rental of space and equipment used for graduation and other events and ceremonies; (5) management contracts for bookstores, performing arts centers, residence halls, parking facilities, and building operations; (6) certain consulting services; (7) construction management services; (8) certain technical equipment purchases or rentals; (9) banking and investment services; (10) energy supply from a third-party supplier; (11) hazardous waste collection and disposal services; (12) supplies and services for the administration of study abroad or remote programs; (13) transportation services; (14) vehicle maintenance; (15) vending services; and (16) medical testing. The bill also provides that a county college may purchase without public advertising for bids if the purchase or contract is to be awarded through a reverse auction for the purchase of utilities and other commodities. Additionally, the bill increases the length of time a county college may enter into certain contracts from 24 to 36 consecutive months and permits a county college to enter into certain contracts for a term of not more than five years. The bill also stipulates maximum contract lengths for the provision of: banking, financial services, and e-commerce services; services for maintenance and repair of building systems; and the purchase of alternative energy or the purchase or lease of alternative energy services or equipment for conservation or cost saving purposes. The bill modifies for county colleges the standard for the award of contracts for goods and services, as distinct from construction contracts. Under current law, these contracts are required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Pursuant to the bill, the board of trustees of a county college is required to award these contracts to the responsible bidder whose bid will be most advantageous to the county college, price and other factors considered. The bill provides that a board of trustees of a county college may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder or the responsible bidder whose bid would otherwise be determined to be most advantageous to the county college as applicable, if the board finds that a board of a public institution of higher education in the State has had a prior negative experience with the bidder within the past 15 years. The bill sets forth conditions that must be applied if a county college is contemplating a bidder disqualification based on prior negative experience including: giving the State college discretion to disqualify a bidder; requiring consideration of mitigating factors; requiring the provision of written notice to the bidder of a potential disqualification and an opportunity for a hearing; and limiting the period of time during which a bidder may be disqualified.

In addition to being published in a legal newspaper, advertisements may also be posted using electronic data or media services, including the Internet. The advertisement shall designate the manner of submitting and of receiving the bids , which may be submitted in electronic format or other format designated by the contracting agent, and the time and place at which the bids will be received.  If the published specifications provide for receipt of bids by mail, those bids which are mailed to the county college shall be sealed and shall be opened only at [such] the time and place as all bids received are unsealed and announced.  At [such] the time and place, the contracting agent of the county college shall publicly receive the bids and thereupon immediately proceed to unseal them and publicly announce the contents, which announcement shall be made in the presence of any parties bidding or their agents who are then and there present.  A proper record of the prices and terms shall be made.

Failure to advertise or provide proper notification of revisions or addenda to advertisements or bid documents related to bids as prescribed by this section shall prevent the acceptance of bids and require the readvertisement for bids.  Failure to obtain a receipt when good faith notice is sent or delivered to the address [or] , telephone facsimile number , or email address on file with the county college shall not be considered failure by the county college to provide notice. (cf: P.L.2005, c.191, s.3) 9.    Section 19 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.19) is amended to read as follows: 19.  All purchases, contracts or agreements , as distinct from contracts or agreements for the construction of buildings and other improvements, which require public advertisement for bids shall be awarded by the board of trustees to the [lowest] responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the county college, price and other factors considered, except that a bid may be disqualified due to a prior negative experience pursuant to the provisions of section 14 of P.L.  , c.  (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).

(cf: P.L.1984, c.241, s.6) 10.  Section 25 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.25) is amended to read as follows: 25. a. In the preparation of plans and specifications for the construction, alteration or repair of any building by a county college, when the entire cost of the work and materials will exceed [$25,000 or, commencing January 1, 2003,] the amount determined pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.3), [separate plans and specifications may be prepared for each of the following branches of work in the following categories, to include all work and materials related thereto or to be performed or furnished in connection therewith] the contracting agent shall advertise for and receive in the manner provided by law: (1) separate bids for branches of work in the following categories: (a)   The plumbing and gas fitting work; (b)   The refrigeration, heating and ventilating systems and equipment; (c)   The electrical work, including any electrical power plants, tele-data, fire alarm, or security systems; (d)   The structural steel and ornamental iron work; (e) General construction, which shall include all other work and materials required for the completion of the project; (2) single bids by general contractors for all work and materials required to complete the entire project, if awarded as a single contract; or (3) separate bids for branches of work in the categories listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection and single bids by general contractors for all work and materials required to complete the entire project, if awarded as a single contract. b.    [With regard to the branch work categories in subsection a. of this section, the contracting agent shall advertise for and receive in the manner provided by law (1) separate bids for each of the foregoing categories (a) through (e), or (2) single bids by general contractors for all work and materials required to complete the entire project, if awarded as a single contract, or (3) both.] (1) In the case of separate bids under paragraph (1) or (3) of [this] subsection a. of this section for [categories (a) through (d) of subsection a. of this section] work in the categories listed in paragraph (1) of subsection a. of this section, prime contractors shall not be required to name subcontractors in their bid.

In every case in which a contract is awarded under (2) above, all payments required to be made under the contract for work and materials supplied by a subcontractor shall, upon the certification of the contractor of the amount due to the subcontractor, be paid directly to the subcontractor.] (cf: P.L.2012, c.59, s.3) 11.  Section 27 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.27) is amended to read as follows: 27.  Any county college may, by resolution of its board of trustees, authorize the sale in the following manner of its personal property not needed for college purposes: a.     If the estimated fair value of the property to be sold exceeds [$25,000] $100,000 or[, commencing January 1, 2003,] the amount determined pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1982, c. 189 (C. 18A:64A-25.3) in any one sale and the property does not consist of perishable goods, it shall be sold at public sale to the highest bidder. b.    Notice of the date, time and place of the public sale, together with a description of the items to be sold and the conditions of sale shall be published once in a legal newspaper.  [Such] The sales shall be held not less than seven nor more than 14 days after the publication of the notice thereof. c.     Personal property may be sold to the United States, the State of New Jersey, another county college or to any body politic by private sale without advertising for bids. d.    If no bids are received, the property may then be sold at private sale without further publication or notice thereof but in no event at less than the estimated fair value; or the county college may, if it so elects, reoffer the property at public sale.  As used herein, "estimated fair value" means the market value of the property if sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer less the cost to the college of continuing to store or maintain [such] the property. e.     A county college may reject all bids if it determines [such] the rejection to be in the public interest.  In any case in which the college has rejected all bids, it may readvertise [such] the personal property for a subsequent public sale.  If it elects to reject all bids at a second public sale pursuant to this section, it may then sell [such] the personal property without further publication or notice thereof at private sale, provided that in no event shall the negotiated price at the private sale be less than the amount of the highest bid rejected  at the preceding two public sales, and provided further that in no event shall the terms or conditions of sale be changed or amended. f.     If the estimated fair value of the property to be sold does not exceed [$25,000] $100,000 or[, commencing January 1, 2003,] the amount determined pursuant to subsection b. of section 3 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.3) in any one sale or the property consists of perishable goods, it may be sold at private sale without advertising for bids. g.    Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, by resolution of the board of trustees, a purchasing agent may include a sale of personal property no longer needed for county college purposes as part of specifications to offset the price of a new purchase. (cf: P.L.2001, c.281, s.6) 12.  Section 28 of P.L.1982, c.189 (C.18A:64A-25.28) is amended to read as follows: 28.

(cf: P.L.2009, c.90, s.45) 13.  (New section) a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a board of trustees of a county college may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board and subject to subsections b. and c. of this section, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder or the responsible bidder whose bid would otherwise be determined to be most advantageous to the county college, as applicable, if the board finds that a board of a public institution of higher education in the State has had prior negative experience with the bidder within the past 15 years. b.    As used in this section, "prior negative experience" means any of the following: (1) the bidder has been found, through either court adjudication, arbitration, mediation, or other contractually stipulated alternate dispute resolution mechanism, to have: failed to provide or perform goods or services; or failed to complete the contract in a timely manner; or otherwise performed unsatisfactorily under a prior contract with a public institution of higher education; (2) the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a public institution of higher education to utilize the services of another contractor to provide the goods or perform the services or to correct or complete the contract; (3) the bidder defaulted on a contract, thereby requiring a public institution of higher education to look to the bidder's surety for completion of the contract or tender of the costs of completion; or (4) the bidder is debarred or suspended from contracting with any of the agencies or departments of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey at the time of the contract award, whether or not the action was based on experience with a public institution of higher education. c.     The following conditions shall apply if the county college is contemplating a disqualification based on prior negative experience: (1)   The existence of any of the indicators of prior negative experience set forth in this section shall not require that a bidder be disqualified.  In each instance, the decision to disqualify shall be made within the discretion of the county college and shall be rendered in the best interests of the county college. (2)   All mitigating factors shall be considered in determining the seriousness of the prior negative experience and in deciding whether disqualification is warranted. (3)   The bidder shall be furnished by the county college with a written notice (a) stating that a disqualification is being considered; (b) setting forth the reason for the disqualification; and (c) indicating that the bidder shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing before the county college if the bidder so requests within a stated period of time.  At the hearing, the bidder shall show good cause why the bidder should not be disqualified by presenting documents and testimony.  If the county college determines that good cause has not been shown by the bidder, it may vote to find the bidder lacking in responsibility and, thus, disqualified. (4)   Disqualification shall be for a reasonable, defined period of time which shall not exceed five years. (5)   A disqualification, other than a disqualification pursuant to which a county college is prohibited by law from entering into a contract with a bidder, may be voided or the period thereof may be reduced, at the discretion of the county college, upon the submission of a good faith application under oath, supported by documentary evidence, setting forth substantial and appropriate grounds for the granting of relief, including reversal of a judgment or actual change of ownership, management, or control of the bidder. (6) An opportunity for a hearing need not be offered to a bidder whose disqualification is based on its suspension or debarment by an agency or department of the executive branch of the State of New Jersey.  The term of [such a] the disqualification shall be concurrent with the term of the suspension or debarment by the State agency or department. 14.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill makes various changes to the County College Contracts Law. The public bid threshold for county colleges is currently $41,600. Under current law, the threshold is adjusted every two years by the Governor, in consultation with the Department of the Treasury, in direct proportion to the rise or fall of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers in New York and Northeastern New Jersey and the Philadelphia areas, as reported by the United States Department of Labor. This bill raises the threshold to $100,000 for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are not paid in accordance to the "New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. The threshold for contracts through which workers employed in the performance of the contract are paid in accordance with the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act remains unchanged. Both thresholds will continue to be adjusted by the Governor every two years in the same manner. This bill revises the law that enumerates numerous exemptions to the requirement for public advertising and bidding to also include: (1) the use of electronic data or media services for the publication of legal notices; (2) the production and reproduction of printed materials in electronic and digital formats; (3) information technology; (4) the rental of space and equipment used for graduation and other events and ceremonies; (5) management contracts for bookstores, performing arts centers, residence halls, parking facilities, and building operations; (6) certain consulting services; (7) construction management services; (8) certain technical equipment purchases or rentals; (9) banking and investment services; (10) energy supply from a third-party supplier; (11) hazardous waste collection and disposal services; (12) supplies and services for the administration of study abroad or remote programs; (13) transportation services; (14) vehicle maintenance; (15) vending services; and (16) medical testing. The bill also provides that a county college may purchase without public advertising for bids if the purchase or contract is to be awarded through a reverse auction for the purchase of utilities and other commodities. Additionally, the bill increases the length of time a county college may enter into certain contracts from 24 to 36 consecutive months and permits a county college to enter into certain contracts for a term of not more than five years. The bill also stipulates maximum contract lengths for the provision of: banking, financial services, and e-commerce services; services for maintenance and repair of building systems; and the purchase of alternative energy or the purchase or lease of alternative energy services or equipment for conservation or cost saving purposes. The bill modifies for county colleges the standard for the award of contracts for goods and services, as distinct from construction contracts. Under current law, these contracts are required to be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. Pursuant to the bill, the board of trustees of a county college is required to award these contracts to the responsible bidder whose bid will be most advantageous to the county college, price and other factors considered. The bill provides that a board of trustees of a county college may, by resolution approved by a majority of the board, disqualify a bidder who would otherwise be determined to be the lowest responsible bidder or the responsible bidder whose bid would otherwise be determined to be most advantageous to the county college as applicable, if the board finds that a board of a public institution of higher education in the State has had a prior negative experience with the bidder within the past 15 years. The bill sets forth conditions that must be applied if a county college is contemplating a bidder disqualification based on prior negative experience including: giving the State college discretion to disqualify a bidder; requiring consideration of mitigating factors; requiring the provision of written notice to the bidder of a potential disqualification and an opportunity for a hearing; and limiting the period of time during which a bidder may be disqualified.
