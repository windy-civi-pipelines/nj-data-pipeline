Under this bill, only public utilities would be required to submit this information. Because these reporting requirements would no longer apply to local utilities and local utility authorities, the bill also provides that the BPU would no longer be required to consult with the Department of Community Affairs when implementing the provisions of N.J.S.A.48:2-29.57 et seq.
