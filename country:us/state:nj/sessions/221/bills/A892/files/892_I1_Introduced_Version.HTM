STATEMENT This bill expands the liability of certain individuals associated with limited liability companies and other commercial entities in relation to residential properties that they lease. Specifically, the bill provides that, in addition to retaining the ability to hold a commercial entity itself liable for housing, building, and health code charges, and charges issued under the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," (HMDL) P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), a court may hold certain members of a member-managed limited liability company, the managers of a manager-managed limited liability company, and the directors and officers of a corporation, jointly and severally liable for such charges, so long as: (1)        there are at least three charges concerning the property leased by the entity for residential purposes; (2)        at least three charges remain unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month following the due date of the first charge; (3)        notice of the charge and impending enforcement has been issued to the address of the record owner, the registered agent, the managing agent, the members in the case of a limited liability company, the directors and officers in the case of a corporation, and each holder of a recorded mortgage and other existing lienholders, if provided within the landlords registration information.  If the landlord is not registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), then this notice requirement would not apply. The notice provided to an individual would be sufficient even if the commercial entity ceases to own the property, so long as the same individual has a role as a registered agent, managing agent, member, manager, director, or officer of the propertys new owner; (4)        the individual, if a member of a member-managed limited liability company, possesses at least a 10 percent interest in the business and (5)        the defendant does not successfully assert an affirmative defense showing a lack of ability to ensure payment of the charge. Additionally, landlord registration requirements, under section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), currently require submission of the name and address of a registered agent who may accept service of process if the landlord is a corporation.  This bill requires a landlord organized as any other legal or commercial entity, to also submit of the name and address of a registered agent, as well as the name and address of the members a member-managed limited liability company who possess at least a 10 percent interest in the business, and the officers and directors in the case of a corporation, when registering as a landlord.  Upon filing this information, the bill requires the municipal clerk to notify the construction official of the name and address of the record owner, and registered agent as applicable. Finally, this bill allows municipalities to amend their housing, building, and health codes to direct that any charge issued to a landlord for violating the code may, after serving notice, be enforced as a lien on the property.  However, enforcement as a lien would only be permitted if the charge remains unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month following the due date of the charge.

(cf: P.L.2001, c.264, s.2) 8.    (New section)  a.  A municipality may direct by ordinance of the governing body that any charge issued to a landlord pursuant to a housing code, building code, or health code, concerning residential property leased by the landlord, shall become a lien on the property, enforceable in the manner provided for real property tax liens in chapter 5 of Title 54 of the Revised Statutes, if the charge remains unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month next following the date when the charge becomes due and owing.  At least 90 days prior to filing an unpaid charge as a municipal lien against the property pursuant to this section, the municipality shall serve written notice to the property owner, and the other parties in interest, indicating that if the charge remains unpaid it shall be converted into a municipal lien, and shall provide the owner the opportunity to pay the fine or request a hearing before a court of competent jurisdiction.  If the landlord is not registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), then this additional notice requirement concerning the landlord shall not apply prior to conversion into a municipal lien.  In a municipality that has adopted an ordinance under this subsection, at the time when the charge becomes a lien, the municipal officer responsible for housing code enforcement shall file a copy of the lien and certification with the municipal tax collector.  This lien shall be added to and become and form part of the taxes next to be assessed and levied upon such dwelling or lands, the same to bear interest at the same rate as taxes, and shall be collected and enforced by the same officers and in the same manner as taxes. b.    As used in this section, charge means any fee, fine, penalty, or other charge issued to a landlord, concerning residential property leased by the landlord, pursuant to a housing, building, or health code. 9.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill expands the liability of certain individuals associated with limited liability companies and other commercial entities in relation to residential properties that they lease. Specifically, the bill provides that, in addition to retaining the ability to hold a commercial entity itself liable for housing, building, and health code charges, and charges issued under the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," (HMDL) P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), a court may hold certain members of a member-managed limited liability company, the managers of a manager-managed limited liability company, and the directors and officers of a corporation, jointly and severally liable for such charges, so long as: (1)        there are at least three charges concerning the property leased by the entity for residential purposes; (2)        at least three charges remain unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month following the due date of the first charge; (3)        notice of the charge and impending enforcement has been issued to the address of the record owner, the registered agent, the managing agent, the members in the case of a limited liability company, the directors and officers in the case of a corporation, and each holder of a recorded mortgage and other existing lienholders, if provided within the landlords registration information.  If the landlord is not registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), then this notice requirement would not apply. The notice provided to an individual would be sufficient even if the commercial entity ceases to own the property, so long as the same individual has a role as a registered agent, managing agent, member, manager, director, or officer of the propertys new owner; (4)        the individual, if a member of a member-managed limited liability company, possesses at least a 10 percent interest in the business and (5)        the defendant does not successfully assert an affirmative defense showing a lack of ability to ensure payment of the charge. Additionally, landlord registration requirements, under section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), currently require submission of the name and address of a registered agent who may accept service of process if the landlord is a corporation.  This bill requires a landlord organized as any other legal or commercial entity, to also submit of the name and address of a registered agent, as well as the name and address of the members a member-managed limited liability company who possess at least a 10 percent interest in the business, and the officers and directors in the case of a corporation, when registering as a landlord.  Upon filing this information, the bill requires the municipal clerk to notify the construction official of the name and address of the record owner, and registered agent as applicable. Finally, this bill allows municipalities to amend their housing, building, and health codes to direct that any charge issued to a landlord for violating the code may, after serving notice, be enforced as a lien on the property.  However, enforcement as a lien would only be permitted if the charge remains unpaid on the first day of the thirteenth month following the due date of the charge.
