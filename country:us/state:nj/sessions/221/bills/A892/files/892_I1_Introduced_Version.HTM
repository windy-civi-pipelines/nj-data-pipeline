landlord is not registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28),

the charge.</p>

within the landlords registration information.  If the landlord is not
registered, in violation of section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28), then this
notice requirement would not apply. The notice provided to an individual would
be sufficient even if the commercial entity ceases to own the property, so long
as the same individual has a role as a registered agent, managing agent,
member, manager, director, or officer of the propertys new owner;</p>

successfully assert an affirmative defense showing a lack of ability to ensure
payment of the charge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, landlord
registration requirements, under section 2 of P.L.1974, c.50 (C.46:8-28),
currently require submission of the name and address of a registered agent who
may accept service of process if the landlord is a corporation.  This bill
requires a landlord organized as any other legal or commercial entity, to also
submit of the name and address of a registered agent, as well as the name and
address of the members a member-managed limited liability company who possess
at least a 10 percent interest in the business, and the officers and directors
in the case of a corporation, when registering as a landlord.  Upon filing this
information, the bill requires the municipal clerk to notify the construction
official of the name and address of the record owner, and registered agent as
applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, this bill allows
municipalities to amend their housing, building, and health codes to direct
that any charge issued to a landlord for violating the code may, after serving
notice, be enforced as a lien on the property.  However, enforcement as a lien
would only be permitted if the charge remains unpaid on the first day of the
thirteenth month following the due date of the charge.</p>
