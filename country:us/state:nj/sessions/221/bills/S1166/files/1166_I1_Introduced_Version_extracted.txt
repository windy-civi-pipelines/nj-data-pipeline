(2)   A written designation pursuant to this section shall be signed by the designator in the presence of two witnesses who shall also sign the designation.  Another person may sign the written designation on the parent's or legal custodian's behalf if the parent or legal custodian is physically unable to do so, or the parent or legal guardian has been arrested, detained, incarcerated, or removed from the State as a result of an administrative separation, provided the designation is signed at the express request of the parent or legal custodian and in the presence of the parent or legal custodian and two witnesses. (3)   The designation shall state the triggering event by which the parent or legal custodian intends the designated standby guardianship of the minor child to be activated. (4)   A parent or legal custodian may designate an alternate standby guardian in the same document, and by the same manner, as the designation of a standby guardian. b.    A designation may, but need not, be in the following form: DESIGNATION OF STANDBY GUARDIAN I,     (name of parent or legal custodian) hereby name (name, home address and telephone number of standby guardian) as designated standby guardian of (name of child(ren)), my child(ren). By this consent and designation, I am providing that the designated standby guardian's authority shall take effect if and when the following event or events occur:  (choose as follows): (1)   my attending physician concludes that I am mentally incapacitated, and thus unable to care for my child(ren); or (2)   my attending physician concludes that I am physically debilitated, and thus unable to care for my child(ren), and I consent in writing before two witnesses to the designated standby guardian's authority taking effect; [or] (3)   upon my death; or (4)   upon my arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal from the State as a result of an administrative separation. In the event that the person designated above is unable or unwilling to act as guardian to my child(ren), I hereby name (name, address and telephone number of alternate designated standby guardian), as alternate designated standby guardian of my child(ren). I understand that this designation will expire six months from the date of this designation, and that the authority of the designated standby guardian, if any, will cease, unless by that date either I or the designated standby guardian petitions the court for appointment as standby guardian pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1995, c.76 (C.3B:12-72). I hereby authorize that the person designated standby guardian as set forth above shall be provided with a copy of the attending physician's statement. In the event that I am incapacitated [or], debilitated, or subject to an administrative separation and a designated standby guardianship is activated pursuant to this statement, I declare that it is my intention to retain full parental rights to the extent consistent with my condition and, further, that I retain the authority to revoke the designated standby guardianship consistent with my rights herein at any time. Designator's Signature: Witness' Signature: Address: Date: Witness' Signature: Address: Date: c.     Nothing in this section shall be construed to involuntarily deprive any parent of parental rights. (cf: P.L.1995, c.76, s.8) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows a parent or legal custodian who has been separated from their child as a result of a federal immigration matter to appoint a standby guardian. Specifically, the bill amends P.L.1995, c.76 (C.3B:12-64 et seq.) to allow the parent or legal custodian to petition the court for the appointment of a standby guardian of a child or to allow the other parent or legal guardian to designate in writing a standby guardian, under specific circumstances, if the parent or custodian is subject to an administrative separation. Currently, a parent or legal custodian can petition the court for the appointment of a standby guardian, and the court may appoint the standby guardian, or another parent or custodian may designate in writing a standby guardian, if the triggering event requiring the appointment is death, incapacity, or debilitation and there is significant risk that the parent or custodian will die, become incapacitated, or become debilitated as a result of a progressive chronic condition or a fatal illness. As used in the bill, administrative separation means the separation of a parent or legal custodian from the parents or legal custodians child as a result of a federal immigration matter, including, but not limited to, arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal, or receipt of official communication by federal, State, or local authorities responsible for immigration enforcement which gives reasonable notice that the care and supervision of the parents or legal custodians child will be interrupted or cannot be provided as the result of the parents or custodians impending arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal. Under the provisions of the bill, the petition would state that the triggering event, an impending administrative separation, occurred to require the appointment of a standby guardian and that there is significant risk that the parent or legal custodian will be the subject of such separation.  However, the parent or custodian would not be required to submit documentation of an impending administrative separation.  If the court finds that that there is a significant risk that the parent or legal guardian will be subject to an administrative separation, a standby guardian would be appointed. Current law does not recognize an administrative separation as a triggering event for the appointment of a standby guardian and does not allow a parent or legal custodian to petition the court for the appointment of a standby guardian, and the court to appoint such a guardian, if there is significant risk that the parent or legal custodian will be the subject to an administrative separation. As required under current law for standby guardians who are appointed due to  death, incapacity, or debilitation, the bill stipulates that: if the triggering event that causes the appointment of a standby guardian is an administrative separation, the parents or legal custodians attorney or legal representative would provide a copy of a determination of administrative separation to the appointed standby guardian, if the guardians identity is known to the parents or custodians attorney or legal representative; and the appointed standby guardian is required to petition the court, including a determination of administrative separation, within 60 days of assuming guardianship duties for confirmation of the appointment. As used in the bill, determination of administrative separation means a written determination by federal, state, or local authorities responsible for immigration enforcement regarding the nature, cause, and extent of the parents or legal guardians arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal. As mandated by the current law for standby guardians who are appointed due to death, incapacity, or debilitation, the bill also stipulates that if the consent of a childs parent or legal custodian for the execution of a power of attorney delegating another person to exercise the parent's or legal custodian's powers is not appropriate or is unavailable pursuant to N.J.S.3B:12-39, the other parent or legal custodian may execute a written statement to designate a standby guardian in the event of the designator's administrative separation. The written designation would identify the designator, the minor child, and the standby guardian.  If the parent or legal custodian has been arrested, detained, incarcerated, or removed from the State as a result of an administrative separation, another person may sign the written designation on the parent's or legal custodian's behalf.

As used in the bill, administrative separation means the separation of a parent or legal custodian from the parents or legal custodians child as a result of a federal immigration matter, including, but not limited to, arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal, or receipt of official communication by federal, State, or local authorities responsible for immigration enforcement which gives reasonable notice that the care and supervision of the parents or legal custodians child will be interrupted or cannot be provided as the result of the parents or custodians impending arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal. Under the provisions of the bill, the petition would state that the triggering event, an impending administrative separation, occurred to require the appointment of a standby guardian and that there is significant risk that the parent or legal custodian will be the subject of such separation.  However, the parent or custodian would not be required to submit documentation of an impending administrative separation.  If the court finds that that there is a significant risk that the parent or legal guardian will be subject to an administrative separation, a standby guardian would be appointed. Current law does not recognize an administrative separation as a triggering event for the appointment of a standby guardian and does not allow a parent or legal custodian to petition the court for the appointment of a standby guardian, and the court to appoint such a guardian, if there is significant risk that the parent or legal custodian will be the subject to an administrative separation. As required under current law for standby guardians who are appointed due to  death, incapacity, or debilitation, the bill stipulates that: if the triggering event that causes the appointment of a standby guardian is an administrative separation, the parents or legal custodians attorney or legal representative would provide a copy of a determination of administrative separation to the appointed standby guardian, if the guardians identity is known to the parents or custodians attorney or legal representative; and the appointed standby guardian is required to petition the court, including a determination of administrative separation, within 60 days of assuming guardianship duties for confirmation of the appointment. As used in the bill, determination of administrative separation means a written determination by federal, state, or local authorities responsible for immigration enforcement regarding the nature, cause, and extent of the parents or legal guardians arrest, detention, incarceration, or removal. As mandated by the current law for standby guardians who are appointed due to death, incapacity, or debilitation, the bill also stipulates that if the consent of a childs parent or legal custodian for the execution of a power of attorney delegating another person to exercise the parent's or legal custodian's powers is not appropriate or is unavailable pursuant to N.J.S.3B:12-39, the other parent or legal custodian may execute a written statement to designate a standby guardian in the event of the designator's administrative separation. The written designation would identify the designator, the minor child, and the standby guardian.  If the parent or legal custodian has been arrested, detained, incarcerated, or removed from the State as a result of an administrative separation, another person may sign the written designation on the parent's or legal custodian's behalf.
