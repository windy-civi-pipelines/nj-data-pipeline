c.72. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 1 of P.L.2020,
c.72 (C.19:63-16.1) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  a.  In addition to
delivering a voted mail-in ballot by mail or in person as provided under
&quot;The Vote By Mail Law,&quot; P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-1 et seq.), a mail-in
voter shall be entitled to deposit the voter's completed mail-in ballot in a
ballot drop box established by the county board of elections as provided under
this section.  Each mail-in ballot deposited in a ballot drop box by the time
designated under current law for the closing of the polls for that election
shall be considered valid and shall be canvassed.  If, at the closing of the
polls, a voter deposits a mail-in ballot at a ballot drop box in a county in
which the voter does not reside, the county board of elections, upon
discovering that fact, shall notify and timely deliver the ballot to the county
board of elections of the county in which the voter resides, who shall accept
the ballot for processing.  The limitations and prohibitions applicable to
mail-in ballot bearers under &quot;The Vote By Mail Law,&quot; P.L.2009, c.79
(C.19:63-1 et seq.) shall apply under this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  (1)  For any election, the
county board of elections in each county shall establish ballot drop boxes
where voters may deposit their voted mail-in ballots at least 45 days before
the election.  The ballot drop boxes shall be located throughout the county in
a manner specified under paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The county board of
elections may establish a pickup schedule to retrieve mail-in ballots deposited
in ballot drop boxes, consistent with the guidelines established by the
Secretary of State pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph (2) of this
subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  (a)  A ballot drop box
shall mean a secured drop box that is not required to be within view of a live
person for monitoring.  All ballot drop boxes shall be available for use by a
voter 24 hours a day and shall be placed at locations equipped with security
cameras that allow for surveillance of the ballot drop box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  Beginning with the 2021
general election, at least one ballot drop box shall be located: at any county
government building in which the main office of the county clerk is located; in
each municipality with a population larger than 5,000 residents; at the main
campus of each State college or university; and the main campus of each
independent four-year college or university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.
Notwithstanding the locational criteria established by this subparagraph,
whenever two or more ballot drop box locations are separated by a distance of
less than 2,000 feet, the board of elections in each county shall determine
secondary locations for those ballot drop boxes in compliance with the
requirements of this section. The secondary ballot drop box locations shall be
located within the municipality where those ballot drop boxes were originally
located and shall be approved by a majority vote of the members of the board of
elections.  However, in the event of a tie in the votes cast by the members of
the board of elections, the county clerk shall cast the deciding vote. 
Whenever possible, at least one ballot drop box shall be located in a municipality
with an average per capita income or a median family income at or below 250% of
the federal poverty guideline according to the most recent federal American
Community Survey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  The board of elections in
each county shall establish no fewer than 10 ballot drop boxes.  To the best of
their ability, the board of elections of every county shall place secure ballot
drop boxes based on geographic location and population density to best serve
the voters of each county in compliance with the guidelines adopted pursuant to
subsection c. of this section.  The Secretary of State shall establish
guidelines for the placement of the ballot drop boxes, the security of the
ballot drop boxes, and the schedule for ballot pickup from the ballot boxes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  All ballot drop box
locations shall be on sites that meet the accessibility requirements applicable
to polling places under R.S.19:8-2 and shall be subject to the same compliance
oversight applicable to polling places under section 3 of P.L.1991, c.429 (C.19:8-3.3). 
A ballot drop box site shall be considered accessible if it is in compliance
with the federal &quot;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990&quot; (42 U.S.C.
s.12101 et seq.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)  Except as otherwise
provided herein, no ballot drop box shall be located inside, or within 100 feet
of an entrance or exit, of a State, county, or municipal police station.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding the provisions
of this subparagraph, a ballot drop box that has already been installed and
permanently affixed prior to the effective date of this act, P.L.2021, c.459,
at any of the following locations may remain at that location notwithstanding
that the ballot drop box is within 100 feet of an entrance or exit of a State,
county, or municipal police station if the county commissioners approve the
continued presence at that location by a majority vote of the commissioners and
with the reasons therefor subject to public disclosure:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     any county government building
in which the main office of the county clerk is located; any municipal
government building in which the main office of the municipal clerk is located
in municipalities with populations larger than 5,000 residents; the main campus
of a county community college; the main campus of a State college or
university; and the main campus of an independent four-year college or
university with enrollments larger than 5,000 students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)  Except as otherwise
permitted herein, no State, county, or municipal police officer shall remain or
stand within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an

location of each ballot drop box, ensuring an equitable distribution of ballot

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Each county clerk shall
include the locations of the ballot drop boxes established in the county along
with the instructions furnished with the mail-in ballot package sent to each
mail-in voter pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2009, c.79 (C.19:63-7).  At least 45
days before each election, each county board of elections shall cause to be
published on their respective websites the location of the ballot drop boxes in
each county, and shall provide this information to the Secretary of State for
publishing the same on the Division of Elections website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill requires the county
board of elections in each county to establish at least one drive-up ballot
drop box in the county and to post certain information at ballot drop boxes and
locations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, each county
board of elections is required to establish at least 10 ballot drop boxes at
locations throughout the county following several criteria. Under this bill, at
least one of those locations would be required to be a drive-up ballot drop
box, defined as a ballot drop box and location designed and evaluated to
possess accessible features including, but not limited to, sufficient vehicle
turning radius adjacent to the driver side, curb cuts, availability of handicap
parking, and an unimpeded path to the ballot drop box from handicap parking.
The bill requires the drive-up ballot drop box to be easy to locate and readily
visible by voters with adequate lighting and a clear line of sight from the
street and parking area.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would also require
certain information to be posted at ballot drop boxes and drop box locations.
Under the bill, all ballot drop boxes would be marked as an Official Ballot
Drop Box. In addition, in a uniform manner prescribed by the Secretary of
State, the following information would be posted at drop boxes and drop box
locations in all languages required under the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965
and under current law for the county: the penalties for drop box tampering;
a-toll free voter hotline; a statement indicating that no postage is necessary
for depositing the ballot into the drop box; a statement indicating that the
drop box is for mail-in ballots only for that county; and a statement informing
the public of the applicable deadline for accepting ballots at the drop box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill directs the
Secretary of State and county boards of elections to include guidelines for
county boards of elections to follow to establish an electioneering boundary of
100 feet around each ballot drop box in compliance with current law. The bill
requires the posting of signs and information to notify the public of the
prohibited electioneering activities within the boundary of the ballot drop box.
