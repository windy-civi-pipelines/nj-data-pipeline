SAMPSON, IV District 31 (Hudson) SYNOPSIS Designates May 15 of each year as Water Safety Day in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating May 15 of each year as Water Safety Day in New Jersey. Whereas, Water safety involves proactive measures to prevent drowning, accidents, and injuries in proximity to bodies of water; and Whereas, The Red Cross specifies water competence as maintaining awareness of water conditions, knowing physical limitations, and never swimming alone; and Whereas, Safe water activity requires supervision, access to safety equipment, and awareness of lifesaving techniques; and Whereas, When practiced safely, water activities may encourage healthy development, improved confidence, and collective wellbeing; and Whereas, Drowning is a costly public health issue, often caused by risky water behavior; and Whereas, Drowning is the second leading cause of death for children ages one to 14, and a leading cause for ages one to 17; and Whereas, More children ages one through four die from drowning than from any other cause, except birth defects; and Whereas, Drowning results in over 4,000 unintentional fatalities each year, accounting for an estimated $53 billion in direct and indirect costs; and Whereas, Worldwide, drowning claims 236,000 lives annually; and Whereas, Over half of all fatal and nonfatal drownings among those 15 years and older occur in natural waters such as rivers, lakes, and oceans; and Whereas, Victims of drowning are disproportionately individuals of color, and 45 percent of Hispanic children and 64 percent of African-American children lack the ability to swim; and Whereas, African-American children ages five through 19 are 5.5 times more likely to drown in a swimming pool; and Whereas, Providing formal swim lessons for youth under four has been shown to reduce the risk of drowning by 88 percent; and Whereas, May 15 is National and International Water Safety Day, designed to raise public awareness of safe water practices; and Whereas, It is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest for this State to adopt measures to raise awareness for behaviors that prevent water-related harms; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    May 15 of each year is designated as Water Safety Day in New Jersey to raise awareness for safe water practices and accident prevention. 2.    The Governor is respectfully requested to issue a proclamation recognizing Water Safety Day in New Jersey, and to call upon public officials and citizens of this State to annually observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution declares May 15 of each year as Water Safety Day in the State of New Jersey to raise public awareness of best practices in accident and injury prevention around bodies of water.  The Red Cross specifies water competence as maintaining awareness of water conditions, knowing physical limitations, and never swimming alone. When practiced safely, water activities may encourage healthy development, improved confidence, and collective wellbeing. Drowning, a consequence of unsafe aquatic behavior, is the second leading cause of death for children ages five to 14, and a leading cause for ages one to 17. More children ages one through four die from drowning than from any other cause, except birth defects. Drowning results in over 4,000 unintentional fatalities each year and accounts for an estimated $53 billion in direct and indirect costs. For each child who dies from drowning, another eight receive emergency room care for non-fatal water related injuries. These nonfatal drownings can cause a number of long-term, significant cognitive and motor skill impairments. Victims of drowning are disproportionately individuals of color, and 45 percent of Hispanic children and 64 percent of African-American children lack the ability to swim. Forty-six percent of parents of children ages four through 17, 39 percent of African-Americans, 61 percent of men, and 42 percent of women say they can perform basic water skills. Seventy-nine percent of children in households with incomes under $50,000 have limited or no ability to swim. Other states have enacted legislation to recognize water injury prevention and the role that aquatic activities play in good physical health, mental health, and quality of life. Tennessee and Georgia have issued proclamations to respect Water Safety Month. Washington, too, has enacted Yoris Law, designating May 15 as Water Safety day in the State. May 15 is National and International water safety day, committed to raise awareness about water safety and the importance of public education regarding safe water practices. In keeping, it is in the best interest of this State  as a diverse and coastal environment  to acknowledge the importance of water competence with this commemorative day.
