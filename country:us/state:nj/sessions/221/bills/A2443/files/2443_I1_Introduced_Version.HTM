A2443 ASSEMBLY, No. 2443 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) Assemblyman  REGINALD W. ATKINS District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Concerns unlawful discrimination and harassment. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning unlawful discrimination and harassment and supplementing and amending P.L.1945, c.169 and amending P.L.2019, c.39. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)    Legislative findings and declarations concerning unlawful harassment. The Legislature finds and declares: a.     The purpose of this section is to affirm that the right to be free from discrimination in employment, housing, business relationships, and places of public accommodation includes the right to be free from unlawful harassment based on any characteristic protected by the Law Against Discrimination. b.    Among the goals of this act is to codify the standard for hostile environment harassment claims set forth in Lehmann v. Toys R Us, Inc., 132 N.J. 587 (1993); Taylor v. Metzger, 152 N.J. 490 (1998); L.W. v. Toms River Regional Schools Board of Education, 189 N.J. 381 (2007); and Justice Ginsburgs concurrence in Harris v. Forklift Systems, 510 U.S. 17, 26 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring). c.     It is the further intent of the Legislature to disavow interpretations of the standard for hostile environment harassment claims under the Law Against Discrimination found in decisions such as Clayton v. City of Atlantic City, 538 Fed. Appx. 124, 129 (3d Cir. 2013), in which the court held that an incident in which a supervisor intentionally grabbed an employees buttocks did not rise to the level of severe or pervasive conduct; Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, 196 N.J. 178, 198 (2008), in which the court held that incidents must be described in sterile terms, stripped of the overlay of (the plaintiffs) subjective reactions to these interactions, because, in the courts view, those reactions were not relevant to the determination of whether the conduct is severe or pervasive, and held that the alleged harassers repeated and unwelcome behavior was one of the socially uncomfortable situations that many women encounter in the course of their lives when someone in whom they are not interested persists in trying to persuade them otherwise.; id. at 201 (harassing conduct not directed at or witnessed by plaintiff cannot factor into analysis of a hostile work environment claim); and Anastasia v. Cushman Wakefield, 455 Fed. Appx. 236, 237-240 (3d Cir. 2011), where the court found that no reasonable jury could find severe or pervasive harassment where: the plaintiffs superior informed her that he was romantically attracted to her and had been for years, and then, over that day and the following day, followed her to the parking lot and gently grabbed her arm, asked her for a photograph of her and her new boyfriend, and concocted a pretext to have (the plaintiff) meet him alone in a break room; the plaintiff immediately took a temporary leave of absence, while her superior continued to call and send emails and text messages to her, despite her repeated statements that his further contact was unwanted; and the plaintiff refused to return to work when her employer refused to create an arrangement under which she would not ultimately have to report to the alleged harasser, and her employer terminated her while she was out on leave, but treated the action as a voluntary resignation. d.    It is not the intent of the Legislature, by enacting this law, to disavow, repudiate or supplant any other established doctrines regarding sexual harassment or unlawful harassment, including: (1) quid pro quo sexual harassment, which exists separately from hostile environment sexual harassment; or (2) business relationship liability, consistent with subsection l. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12) and J.T.s Tire Service, Inc. v. United Rentals North America, Inc., 411 N.J. Super. 236 (App. Div. 2010). 2.    (New section)   Unlawful harassment; standard; interpretation. a.     It shall be unlawful discrimination in violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for a person or entity to subject an individual, because of sex or any other characteristic of the individual protected under section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), to unlawful harassment. b.    In order to state a claim for unlawful harassment based on a hostile work environment under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), a complainant shall show conduct that occurred because of sex or any other characteristic of the individual protected under section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), which a reasonable person in the complainants protected class would find to be sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. When a violation of this subsection occurs in a workplace, it shall also be an unlawful employment practice. (1)   The following standards shall guide the determination of whether a violation of this subsection has occurred: (a)   A determination of whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall be based upon the totality of the circumstances. In evaluating the severity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassing conduct, the cumulative effect of all incidents of harassing conduct shall be considered as a whole rather than considering individual incidents in isolation, provided, however, that a single incident of harassing conduct may be sufficiently severe to create a triable issue of fact regarding the existence of an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. De minimis incidents such as petty slights or trivial inconveniences shall not by themselves be actionable under this act, provided however that a court shall consider all evidence, including de minimis or isolated incidents, when evaluating the totality of the circumstances. (b)   A determination of whether harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall include a consideration of whether a reasonable person in complainants protected class would consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment, provided that a complainants subjective responses to the harassing conduct shall be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances that are relevant to whether a reasonable person belonging to the same protected class would consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment. In addition, the complainants knowledge of harassment directed to others may be relevant to evaluating whether a hostile work environment exists, whether or not the complainant witnessed the harassing conduct. (c)   For purposes of this section, harassing conduct may include but not be limited to physical contact or gestures, threats, abusive or offensive language, damage to or interference with personal property, or offensive written or verbal communications or comments, whether such conduct is of a sexual nature or otherwise. Harassing conduct shall not be construed to require physical contact to qualify as severe or pervasive. (d)   It shall not be necessary to demonstrate loss of tangible job benefits to establish a violation of this subsection, nor shall it be necessary for the complainant to prove that the complainants tangible productivity declined because of the harassing conduct. (2)   The following standards shall be applicable for assessing employer liability for hostile work environment harassment pursuant to a negligence theory under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.): (a)   An employer shall be liable for the unlawful harassment if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knew or should have known of the harassing conduct and failed to take appropriate preventive or corrective action. (b)   An employer may be held responsible for the harassing conduct of non-employees if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take appropriate preventive or corrective action. However, in reviewing cases involving the acts of non-employees, consideration shall be given to the extent of the entitys control and any other responsibility that the entity may have with respect to the conduct of those non-employees. (c)   Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to in any way alter the standard for imposing direct or vicarious liability on the employer for the harassing acts of supervisors or superiors. (3)   For purposes of claims brought under this subsection alleging that an employer committed a violation of this section, the definition of employer shall include: any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. For purposes of such claims brought by an employee who performs domestic work, it shall also be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to allow any family member or member of their household, regardless of age, to engage in unlawful harassment based on any other category protected by this subsection, or for an employer to keep or request to keep permanent or continuing possession of the employees passport or other identifying documents. c.     (1)  The standard for assessing an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing or a place of public accommodation, including a school, shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, but shall include consideration of whether the harassment created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing, school, or other place of public accommodation. (2)   The standard for assessing liability of an entity for an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing or a place of public accommodation, including a school, shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, but shall include consideration of whether the entity took appropriate preventive or corrective action in the applicable setting of housing, a school, or other place of public accommodation. (3)   The standard for assessing liability of an entity for an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment in the context of a business relationship brought pursuant to subsection l. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section. 3.    (New section)   Mandatory workplace policies on unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment of an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Within one year of the date of enactment of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall adopt a written nondiscrimination policy that establishes policies and procedures concerning unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace which is applicable to all employees in their interactions with each other and with vendors, suppliers, customers, clients, and patrons, and which shall include, at a minimum, the following: (1)   a statement that unlawful discrimination or harassment in the workplace will not be tolerated and are considered a form of employee misconduct, and that sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in unlawful discrimination or harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue; (2)   a definition of unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment in employment; (3)   examples of discriminatory and harassing behaviors prohibited by the policy; (4)   a description of the process for filing internal complaints about such discrimination or harassment and the complete contact information of the person or persons to whom complaints should be made; (5)   directions as to how to contact the division if a person believes their rights were violated; (6)   the statute of limitations periods applicable to filing a claim of unlawful discrimination and harassment under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); (7)   a prohibition on retaliation against those who disclose, report, participate in an investigation of, or otherwise challenge such discrimination or harassment; (8)   examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the policy; (9)   a description of potential consequences for violating the policy; and (10)  a statement of the employers commitment to conducting prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations of complaints of such discrimination or harassment. c.     All employers shall disseminate the policy required in subsection b. of this section at least once annually to all employees, and to each employee: (1)   at the beginning of their employment; (2)   who complains internally about a violation of the policy, at the time such complaint is made; (3)   who is interviewed by the employer or the employers designee in connection with any investigation of any complaint about a violation of the policy, prior to or at the time of such interview; and (4)   whenever any updates to the policy are made. d.    All employers shall review the policy at least annually to ensure that it complies with this section and other applicable laws and regulations. e.     All employers shall make the policy available in English, Spanish and any language spoken by an employee who does not speak English as their primary language and who has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English, if the division has made the model policy described in paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section available in that language. f.     The division shall, within six months of the date of enactment of this act, at a minimum: (1)   create one model nondiscrimination policy that satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section and that can be adopted by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; (2)   create one model domestic work anti-harassment policy designed for use by any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work. That model policy shall include, but not be limited to, a definition of unlawful harassment, examples of harassing behaviors prohibited by the policy, the identity and role of the division, directions for how to contact the division, a description of unlawful retaliation, examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the policy, and the applicable statute of limitations periods for bringing a claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); and (3)   make the model policies required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection available at no cost on the divisions website in English, Spanish, and any other language deemed appropriate by the director, based on the size of the New Jersey state population that speaks each language and any other factor that the director shall deem relevant. g.    Employers with fewer than 50 employees may comply with: (1)   subsection b. of this section by adopting the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section and adding the complete contact information of the person or persons to whom complaints should be made; (2)   subsection c. of this section by distributing the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section to each employee: (a)   at the beginning of their employment; (b)   at least once annually; (c)   who complains internally about a violation of the policy, at the time such complaint is made; (d)   who is interviewed by the employer or the employers designee in connection with any investigation of any complaint about a violation of the policy, prior to or at the time of such interview; and (e)   whenever any updates to the policy are made; (3)   subsection d. of this section by ensuring that they adopt the version of the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section in force at the time those employers conduct their annual review; and (4)   subsection e. of this section by providing a printed copy of the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section: (a)   in English; or (b)   in the language that an employee identifies as their primary language, if such employee has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English and if the division has made the model policy available in that employees primary language. (5)   Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring an employer with fewer than 50 employees to adopt the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section rather than adopting its own policy that meets the requirements outlined in subsections b., c., d., and e. of this section. h.    In addition to the requirements in subsections b., c., d., and e. of this section, employers with 50 or more employees shall: (1)   in addition to the content requirements outlined in subsection b. of this section, customize their policy to their specific workplace and industry by, at a minimum, including: (a)   multiple channels through which an employee may report unlawful discrimination or harassment; and (b)   a general description of the process by which the employer will conduct prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations and respond to complaints regarding such discrimination or harassment. (2)   In addition to the dissemination requirements outlined in subsection c. of this section: (a)   post the policy in a prominent location on the employers website, provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall require an employer to create or maintain a website for the sole purpose of posting the policy thereon; and (b)   disseminate the policy to any employee upon that employees promotion. (3)   In addition to the translation requirements outlined in subsection e. of this section, translate the nondiscrimination policy required by subsection b. of this section into any language identified by an employee as their primary language, if such employee does not speak English as their primary language and has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. i.     Any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence or in the private residence of a family member is encouraged, at the time of any such hire and at least once annually, to provide to such individual a printed copy of the model domestic work anti-harassment policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section. j.     For purposes of this section, an employer has 50 or more employees if such employer employs 50 or more employees, whether employed in New Jersey or not, for each work day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the then current or immediately preceding calendar year. k.    Notwithstanding any other provision of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a private person to file a complaint with the division or initiate an action in superior court alleging a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) because of any failure to comply with the provisions of this section. However, the Attorney General or the director may enforce violations of this section and may pursue any penalty or remedy available under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) in doing so. An employers compliance with this section, or use of materials provided for herein, shall not, in and of itself, protect the employer from liability under this act. 4.    (New section)    Mandatory workplace training on unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment against an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Beginning one year from the effective date of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall provide interactive training to all employees other than those employees covered by subsection c. of this section on the nondiscrimination policy required by section 3 of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace. The training shall be provided to all new employees within 90 days of initial hire, and to all employees at least once every two years. Such training shall include, at minimum: (1)   A statement that unlawful discrimination or harassment in the workplace will not be tolerated and are considered a form of employee misconduct, and that sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in discrimination or harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue; (2)   A definition of unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment in employment; (3)   Examples of discriminatory and harassing behaviors prohibited by the nondiscrimination policy adopted by the employer pursuant to section 3 of P.L.     , c.         (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (4)   A description of the process for filing internal complaints about such discrimination or harassment; (5)   Directions as to how to contact the division if a person believes their rights were violated; (6)   A description of the prohibition on retaliation against those who disclose, report, participate in an investigation of, or otherwise challenge such discrimination or harassment; (7)   Examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the nondiscrimination policy adopted by the employer pursuant to section 3 of P.L.     , c.         (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (8)   Information concerning bystander intervention. c.     Beginning one year from the effective date of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall provide interactive training to all supervisory employees regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace at least once every two years and shall provide such training to all new supervisory employees within 90 days of initial hire or promotion. Such training shall include, at minimum: (1)   the topics required by paragraphs (1) through (8) of subsection b. of this section; (2)   the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prevention of discrimination and harassment; (3)   the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prohibitions against retaliation; and (4)   measures and corrective actions supervisors may take to appropriately address complaints and instances of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. d.    All employers shall keep a record of their employees completion of all trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section. Such records may be electronic. Employers shall maintain such records for at least three years and such records must be made available for division inspection upon request. e.     All employers shall review the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section at least annually to ensure that they comply with this section and with other applicable laws and regulations. f.     All employers shall make the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section available: (1)   in English; and (2)   in any language spoken by an employee who does not speak English as their primary language and who has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English, if the division has made the training described in subsection g. of this section available in that language. g.    In addition to any other actions the division may undertake, it shall, within six months of enactment of P.L.     , c.         (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): (1)   develop an online, one-hour training module that satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section and that can be used by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; (2)   develop an online, two-hour training module that satisfies the requirements of subsection c. of this section and that can be used by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; and (3)   make the training modules required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection available at no cost on the divisions website in English, Spanish, and any other language deemed appropriate by the director, based on the size of the New Jersey state population that speaks each language and any other factor that the director shall deem relevant. h.    Employers with fewer than 50 employees may comply with the requirements of subsections b. and c. of this section by requiring their employees to view the model nondiscrimination trainings promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section. For any employer that chooses to utilize the model trainings promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section, they may also comply with the requirements of: (1)   subsection e. of this section by ensuring that they utilize the version of the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section in force at the time such training is given; and (2)   subsection f. of this section by directing each employee to the model nondiscrimination trainings made available on the divisions website pursuant to subsection g. of this section in English, Spanish, and any other languages deemed appropriate by the director. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an employer with fewer than 50 employees to utilize the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section rather than adopting their own nondiscrimination training that meets the minimum requirements outlined in subsections b. and c. of this section. i.     Employers with 50 or more employees shall provide the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section in a live, in-person setting where participants can ask questions. They may not comply with the requirements of this section by using the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division. Such employers shall also provide interpretation at the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section for any employee who does not speak English as their primary language and has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. j.     For purposes of this section, an employer has 50 or more employees if such employer employs 50 or more employees, whether employed in New Jersey or not, for each work day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the then current or immediately preceding calendar year. k.    For purposes of this section, interactive training means that the training must be participatory. However, except where explicitly required herein, such interactive training is not required to be live or facilitated by an in-person instructor in order to satisfy the provisions of this section. l.     The training required by this section is intended to establish a minimum threshold and should not discourage any employer from providing for longer, more frequent, or more elaborate training regarding workplace harassment or other forms of unlawful discrimination. m.   Notwithstanding any other provision of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a private person to file a complaint with the division or initiate an action in superior court alleging a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), because of any failure to comply with the provisions of this section. However, the Attorney General or the director may enforce violations of this section and may pursue any penalty or remedy available under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), in doing so. An employers compliance with this section, or use of materials provided for herein, shall not, in and of itself, protect the employer from liability for unlawful discrimination or harassment under this act. 5.    (New section)    Mandatory reporting on unlawful employment discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment against an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Beginning one year after the date of enactment of this act, employers with 50 or more employees shall be required to collect and annually report to the division the following data on complaints received regarding unlawful workplace discrimination or harassment, including sexual harassment, using the form created and made available on the divisions website pursuant to subsection e. of this section for that purpose: the total number of complaints filed; the number of complaints filed that were found by the employer to be substantiated; the number of complaints filed that were found by the employer to be unsubstantiated; the number of complaints filed whose resolution is still pending. c.     The data submitted for each of the categories in subsection b. of this section shall be broken down by how many such complaints involved allegations of unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, as well as by the protected class or classes that the complainant alleged. d.    Employers shall be required to maintain any records related to the complaints reported to the division pursuant to subsections b. and c. of this section for at least three years and such records must be made available for division inspection upon request. e.     The division shall, within six months of the date of enactment of this act, create a form to be used by employers when submitting the data required to be reported under subsections b. and c. of this section.

(2)   Refuse to grant or accept any letter of credit or other document which evidences the transfer of funds or credit, or refuse to enter into any contract for the exchange of goods or services, on the ground that it does not contain such a discriminatory provision or certification. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any letter of credit, contract, or other document which contains any provision pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, a labor dispute or an unfair labor practice, or made in connection with the protest of unlawful discrimination or an unlawful employment practice, if the other provisions of such letter of credit, contract, or other document do not otherwise violate the provisions of this subsection. n.    For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, coerce, or induce the doing of any act forbidden by subsections l. and m. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or to attempt, or to conspire to do so.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to [his] the employees religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employees sincerely held religious observance or practice. Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at [his] the persons place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of [his] the persons religion, [he] the person observes as [his] the persons Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between [his] the persons place of employment and [his] the persons home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)   (a)   For purposes of this subsection q., undue hardship means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii)  For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which [he or she] the employee is employed. (d)   (i)    The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer. The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from , discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to , or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. For purposes of this subsection, the definition of employer includes any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work. In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of an employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer. The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work. This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employees rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section pregnancy or breastfeeding means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employers business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employers business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employers operations, including the composition and structure of the employers workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility. An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection. An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity. A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employers operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, member of a protected class means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to preclude employers from engaging interns in unpaid positions or paying interns at a different rate than other staff, provided, however, that if an employer provides compensation to interns, it may not provide such compensation to interns who are members of a protected class at a rate less than interns who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility. (cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.3) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  A provision in any employment contract, including any contract for the performance of domestic work, that waives any substantive or procedural right or remedy relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment shall be deemed against public policy and unenforceable. b.    No right or remedy under the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute or case law shall be prospectively waived. c.     This section shall not apply to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement between an employer and the collective bargaining representative of the employees.

If the employee publicly reveals sufficient details of the claim so that the employer is reasonably identifiable, then the non-disclosure provision shall also be unenforceable against the employer. b.    Every settlement agreement resolving a discrimination, retaliation, or harassment claim by an employee against an employer shall include a bold, prominently placed notice that although the parties may have agreed to keep the settlement and underlying facts confidential, such a provision in an agreement is unenforceable against the employer if the employee publicly reveals sufficient details of the claim so that the employer is reasonably identifiable. c.     Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, this section shall not be construed to prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to sign an agreement: (1)   in which the employee agrees not to enter into competition with the employer during or after employment; or (2)   in which the employee agrees not to disclose proprietary information, which includes only non-public trade secrets, business plan and customer information. d.    For purposes of claims brought this section, the definition of employer includes any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. (cf: P.L.2019, c.39, s.2) 10.  Section 5 of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.11) is amended to read as follows: 5.    Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7 et seq.) may initiate suit in Superior Court.

All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs. These remedies are in addition to any provided by P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7 et seq.) or any other statute. A prevailing plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable [attorney] attorneys fees and costs. (cf: P.L.2019, c.39, s.5) 11.  Section 12 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-13) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  (1)  Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make, sign, and file with the division a verified complaint in writing which shall state the name and address of the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or agent alleged to have committed the unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination complained of and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and shall contain such other information as may be required by the division.  Such complaint shall be filed with the division or in any municipal office pursuant to P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) within one year after the alleged unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination based on any other category protected by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.).  Upon receipt of the complaint, the division shall notify the complainant on a form promulgated by the director of the division and approved by the Attorney General of the complainant's rights under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), including the right to file a complaint in the Superior Court to be heard before a jury; of the jurisdictional limitations of the division; and any other provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), without interpretation, that may apply to the complaint. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Attorney General, the director, or the Commissioner of Education may, in like manner, make, sign, and file such complaint. Any employer whose employees, or some of them, refuse, or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), may file with the division a verified complaint asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action. (2)   Any complainant, including any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination, the Attorney General, the director, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Commissioner of Education, may initiate suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) without first filing a complaint with the division or any municipal office.  Any such action, other than an action by the Attorney General or the director, shall be commenced within three years after the cause of that action shall have accrued.  In such proceedings: (a)   Upon the application of any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) specified in the suit. (b)   All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs, and if the Attorney General or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, those remedies shall be available on behalf of named or unnamed victims. If the suit seeks relief for one or more unnamed members of a protected class, the Attorney General or the director shall have the discretion to settle the suit on such terms as the Attorney General or the director deems appropriate. The injunctive relief set forth in section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) shall also be available to prevailing plaintiffs. These remedies are in addition to any other provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute.

In the alternative, in lieu of these penalties, the Attorney General or director may seek and obtain punitive damages payable to the State upon a finding that the provisions of P.L.1995, c.142 (C.2A:15-5.9 et al.) are satisfied. Prosecution of such suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall bar the filing of a complaint with the division or any municipal office during the pendency of any such suit. (d)   If a jury or court determines that an employer has committed an unlawful employment practice prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), the judge shall award three times any monetary damages to the person or persons aggrieved by the violation. (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of P.L.1979, c.404 (C.10:5-27.1), if the Attorney General or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, the court shall award reasonable attorneys fees and litigation and investigation costs. b.    At any time after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the division, a complainant may file a request with the division to present the action personally or through counsel to the Office of Administrative Law. Upon such request, the director of the division shall file the action with the Office of Administrative Law, provided that no action may be filed with the Office of Administrative Law where the director of the division has found that no probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the complaint or has otherwise dismissed the complaint. c.     A party to an action based upon a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall mail a copy of the initial pleadings or claims, amended pleadings or claims, counterclaims, briefs, and legal memoranda to the division at the same time as filing such documents with the Office of Administrative Law or the court. Upon application to the Office of Administrative Law or to the court wherein the matter is pending, the division shall be permitted to intervene. (P.L.2019, c.436, s.5) 12.  Section 17 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-18) is amended to read as follows: The Attorney General shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite and effectuate the foregoing procedure and [his] the Attorney Generals own actions thereunder. Any complaint filed in the division or in any municipal office pursuant to this act must be so filed within [180 days] one year after the alleged act of discrimination or from the discovery of the alleged act of discrimination. (cf: P.L.1979, c.404, s.4) 13.  This act shall take effect of the first day of the third month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill makes it unlawful discrimination in violation of the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) to subject an individual to unlawful harassment, because of the individuals sex or other characteristic protected under that law. The bill sets standards and procedures for determining when unlawful harassment occurs, both for cases of unlawful employment practices and for cases of unlawful discrimination. For a claim that harassment is an unlawful employment practice based on a hostile work environment, determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred is based on factors which include whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, based on the totality of the circumstances, including the cumulative effect of all incidents of harassing conduct affecting all workers in a workplace, regardless of whether or not the conduct involved direct physical contact or threats or loss of job benefits. For a claim that harassment is an unlawful discrimination based on a hostile environment in housing, a school, or other place of public accommodation, determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred is based on the same factors as they would apply to such discrimination. The bill requires employers to establish written nondiscrimination workplace policies to prevent unlawful discrimination and harassment, which explain the policies, and stipulate procedures and remedies for violations.  The Division on Civil Rights is directed to create a model nondiscrimination policy that complies with the requirements of the bill and can be adopted by an employer with fewer than 50 employees, and another model policy specifically for employers of domestic workers. The bill requires an employer to provide interactive training to all supervisory employees and all other employees regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace, and sets standards for the training and the responsibilities of supervisors under the bill. The bill also sets requirements for each employer with 50 or more employees regarding the collection and reporting to the division by an employer of data regarding complaints of violations of the provisions of the bill. The bill extends the protections of the Law Against Discrimination to cover domestic workers. The bill sets or extends the periods of time in which certain actions regarding unlawful discrimination may be taken.

A2443 ASSEMBLY, No. 2443 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  ANNETTE QUIJANO District 20 (Union) Assemblyman  REGINALD W. ATKINS District 20 (Union) SYNOPSIS Concerns unlawful discrimination and harassment. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning unlawful discrimination and harassment and supplementing and amending P.L.1945, c.169 and amending P.L.2019, c.39. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)    Legislative findings and declarations concerning unlawful harassment. The Legislature finds and declares: a.     The purpose of this section is to affirm that the right to be free from discrimination in employment, housing, business relationships, and places of public accommodation includes the right to be free from unlawful harassment based on any characteristic protected by the Law Against Discrimination. b.    Among the goals of this act is to codify the standard for hostile environment harassment claims set forth in Lehmann v. Toys R Us, Inc., 132 N.J. 587 (1993); Taylor v. Metzger, 152 N.J. 490 (1998); L.W. v. Toms River Regional Schools Board of Education, 189 N.J. 381 (2007); and Justice Ginsburgs concurrence in Harris v. Forklift Systems, 510 U.S. 17, 26 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring). c.     It is the further intent of the Legislature to disavow interpretations of the standard for hostile environment harassment claims under the Law Against Discrimination found in decisions such as Clayton v. City of Atlantic City, 538 Fed. Appx. 124, 129 (3d Cir. 2013), in which the court held that an incident in which a supervisor intentionally grabbed an employees buttocks did not rise to the level of severe or pervasive conduct; Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, 196 N.J. 178, 198 (2008), in which the court held that incidents must be described in sterile terms, stripped of the overlay of (the plaintiffs) subjective reactions to these interactions, because, in the courts view, those reactions were not relevant to the determination of whether the conduct is severe or pervasive, and held that the alleged harassers repeated and unwelcome behavior was one of the socially uncomfortable situations that many women encounter in the course of their lives when someone in whom they are not interested persists in trying to persuade them otherwise.; id. at 201 (harassing conduct not directed at or witnessed by plaintiff cannot factor into analysis of a hostile work environment claim); and Anastasia v. Cushman Wakefield, 455 Fed. Appx. 236, 237-240 (3d Cir. 2011), where the court found that no reasonable jury could find severe or pervasive harassment where: the plaintiffs superior informed her that he was romantically attracted to her and had been for years, and then, over that day and the following day, followed her to the parking lot and gently grabbed her arm, asked her for a photograph of her and her new boyfriend, and concocted a pretext to have (the plaintiff) meet him alone in a break room; the plaintiff immediately took a temporary leave of absence, while her superior continued to call and send emails and text messages to her, despite her repeated statements that his further contact was unwanted; and the plaintiff refused to return to work when her employer refused to create an arrangement under which she would not ultimately have to report to the alleged harasser, and her employer terminated her while she was out on leave, but treated the action as a voluntary resignation. d.    It is not the intent of the Legislature, by enacting this law, to disavow, repudiate or supplant any other established doctrines regarding sexual harassment or unlawful harassment, including: (1) quid pro quo sexual harassment, which exists separately from hostile environment sexual harassment; or (2) business relationship liability, consistent with subsection l. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12) and J.T.s Tire Service, Inc. v. United Rentals North America, Inc., 411 N.J. Super. 236 (App. Div. 2010). 2.    (New section)   Unlawful harassment; standard; interpretation. a.     It shall be unlawful discrimination in violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for a person or entity to subject an individual, because of sex or any other characteristic of the individual protected under section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), to unlawful harassment. b.    In order to state a claim for unlawful harassment based on a hostile work environment under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), a complainant shall show conduct that occurred because of sex or any other characteristic of the individual protected under section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), which a reasonable person in the complainants protected class would find to be sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. When a violation of this subsection occurs in a workplace, it shall also be an unlawful employment practice. (1)   The following standards shall guide the determination of whether a violation of this subsection has occurred: (a)   A determination of whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall be based upon the totality of the circumstances. In evaluating the severity or pervasiveness of the alleged harassing conduct, the cumulative effect of all incidents of harassing conduct shall be considered as a whole rather than considering individual incidents in isolation, provided, however, that a single incident of harassing conduct may be sufficiently severe to create a triable issue of fact regarding the existence of an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. De minimis incidents such as petty slights or trivial inconveniences shall not by themselves be actionable under this act, provided however that a court shall consider all evidence, including de minimis or isolated incidents, when evaluating the totality of the circumstances. (b)   A determination of whether harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive so as to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall include a consideration of whether a reasonable person in complainants protected class would consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment, provided that a complainants subjective responses to the harassing conduct shall be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances that are relevant to whether a reasonable person belonging to the same protected class would consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment. In addition, the complainants knowledge of harassment directed to others may be relevant to evaluating whether a hostile work environment exists, whether or not the complainant witnessed the harassing conduct. (c)   For purposes of this section, harassing conduct may include but not be limited to physical contact or gestures, threats, abusive or offensive language, damage to or interference with personal property, or offensive written or verbal communications or comments, whether such conduct is of a sexual nature or otherwise. Harassing conduct shall not be construed to require physical contact to qualify as severe or pervasive. (d)   It shall not be necessary to demonstrate loss of tangible job benefits to establish a violation of this subsection, nor shall it be necessary for the complainant to prove that the complainants tangible productivity declined because of the harassing conduct. (2)   The following standards shall be applicable for assessing employer liability for hostile work environment harassment pursuant to a negligence theory under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.): (a)   An employer shall be liable for the unlawful harassment if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knew or should have known of the harassing conduct and failed to take appropriate preventive or corrective action. (b)   An employer may be held responsible for the harassing conduct of non-employees if the entity, or its agents or supervisors, knew or should have known of the conduct and failed to take appropriate preventive or corrective action. However, in reviewing cases involving the acts of non-employees, consideration shall be given to the extent of the entitys control and any other responsibility that the entity may have with respect to the conduct of those non-employees. (c)   Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to in any way alter the standard for imposing direct or vicarious liability on the employer for the harassing acts of supervisors or superiors. (3)   For purposes of claims brought under this subsection alleging that an employer committed a violation of this section, the definition of employer shall include: any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. For purposes of such claims brought by an employee who performs domestic work, it shall also be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to allow any family member or member of their household, regardless of age, to engage in unlawful harassment based on any other category protected by this subsection, or for an employer to keep or request to keep permanent or continuing possession of the employees passport or other identifying documents. c.     (1)  The standard for assessing an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing or a place of public accommodation, including a school, shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, but shall include consideration of whether the harassment created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing, school, or other place of public accommodation. (2)   The standard for assessing liability of an entity for an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment in housing or a place of public accommodation, including a school, shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section, but shall include consideration of whether the entity took appropriate preventive or corrective action in the applicable setting of housing, a school, or other place of public accommodation. (3)   The standard for assessing liability of an entity for an unlawful harassment claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) alleging an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment in the context of a business relationship brought pursuant to subsection l. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), shall be equivalent to the standard set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection b. of this section. 3.    (New section)   Mandatory workplace policies on unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment of an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Within one year of the date of enactment of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall adopt a written nondiscrimination policy that establishes policies and procedures concerning unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace which is applicable to all employees in their interactions with each other and with vendors, suppliers, customers, clients, and patrons, and which shall include, at a minimum, the following: (1)   a statement that unlawful discrimination or harassment in the workplace will not be tolerated and are considered a form of employee misconduct, and that sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in unlawful discrimination or harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue; (2)   a definition of unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment in employment; (3)   examples of discriminatory and harassing behaviors prohibited by the policy; (4)   a description of the process for filing internal complaints about such discrimination or harassment and the complete contact information of the person or persons to whom complaints should be made; (5)   directions as to how to contact the division if a person believes their rights were violated; (6)   the statute of limitations periods applicable to filing a claim of unlawful discrimination and harassment under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); (7)   a prohibition on retaliation against those who disclose, report, participate in an investigation of, or otherwise challenge such discrimination or harassment; (8)   examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the policy; (9)   a description of potential consequences for violating the policy; and (10)  a statement of the employers commitment to conducting prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations of complaints of such discrimination or harassment. c.     All employers shall disseminate the policy required in subsection b. of this section at least once annually to all employees, and to each employee: (1)   at the beginning of their employment; (2)   who complains internally about a violation of the policy, at the time such complaint is made; (3)   who is interviewed by the employer or the employers designee in connection with any investigation of any complaint about a violation of the policy, prior to or at the time of such interview; and (4)   whenever any updates to the policy are made. d.    All employers shall review the policy at least annually to ensure that it complies with this section and other applicable laws and regulations. e.     All employers shall make the policy available in English, Spanish and any language spoken by an employee who does not speak English as their primary language and who has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English, if the division has made the model policy described in paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section available in that language. f.     The division shall, within six months of the date of enactment of this act, at a minimum: (1)   create one model nondiscrimination policy that satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section and that can be adopted by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; (2)   create one model domestic work anti-harassment policy designed for use by any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work. That model policy shall include, but not be limited to, a definition of unlawful harassment, examples of harassing behaviors prohibited by the policy, the identity and role of the division, directions for how to contact the division, a description of unlawful retaliation, examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the policy, and the applicable statute of limitations periods for bringing a claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.); and (3)   make the model policies required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection available at no cost on the divisions website in English, Spanish, and any other language deemed appropriate by the director, based on the size of the New Jersey state population that speaks each language and any other factor that the director shall deem relevant. g.    Employers with fewer than 50 employees may comply with: (1)   subsection b. of this section by adopting the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section and adding the complete contact information of the person or persons to whom complaints should be made; (2)   subsection c. of this section by distributing the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section to each employee: (a)   at the beginning of their employment; (b)   at least once annually; (c)   who complains internally about a violation of the policy, at the time such complaint is made; (d)   who is interviewed by the employer or the employers designee in connection with any investigation of any complaint about a violation of the policy, prior to or at the time of such interview; and (e)   whenever any updates to the policy are made; (3)   subsection d. of this section by ensuring that they adopt the version of the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section in force at the time those employers conduct their annual review; and (4)   subsection e. of this section by providing a printed copy of the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section: (a)   in English; or (b)   in the language that an employee identifies as their primary language, if such employee has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English and if the division has made the model policy available in that employees primary language. (5)   Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted as requiring an employer with fewer than 50 employees to adopt the model nondiscrimination policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection f. of this section rather than adopting its own policy that meets the requirements outlined in subsections b., c., d., and e. of this section. h.    In addition to the requirements in subsections b., c., d., and e. of this section, employers with 50 or more employees shall: (1)   in addition to the content requirements outlined in subsection b. of this section, customize their policy to their specific workplace and industry by, at a minimum, including: (a)   multiple channels through which an employee may report unlawful discrimination or harassment; and (b)   a general description of the process by which the employer will conduct prompt, thorough, and impartial investigations and respond to complaints regarding such discrimination or harassment. (2)   In addition to the dissemination requirements outlined in subsection c. of this section: (a)   post the policy in a prominent location on the employers website, provided, however, that nothing in this subsection shall require an employer to create or maintain a website for the sole purpose of posting the policy thereon; and (b)   disseminate the policy to any employee upon that employees promotion. (3)   In addition to the translation requirements outlined in subsection e. of this section, translate the nondiscrimination policy required by subsection b. of this section into any language identified by an employee as their primary language, if such employee does not speak English as their primary language and has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. i.     Any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence or in the private residence of a family member is encouraged, at the time of any such hire and at least once annually, to provide to such individual a printed copy of the model domestic work anti-harassment policy promulgated by the division pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection f. of this section. j.     For purposes of this section, an employer has 50 or more employees if such employer employs 50 or more employees, whether employed in New Jersey or not, for each work day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the then current or immediately preceding calendar year. k.    Notwithstanding any other provision of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a private person to file a complaint with the division or initiate an action in superior court alleging a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) because of any failure to comply with the provisions of this section. However, the Attorney General or the director may enforce violations of this section and may pursue any penalty or remedy available under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) in doing so. An employers compliance with this section, or use of materials provided for herein, shall not, in and of itself, protect the employer from liability under this act. 4.    (New section)    Mandatory workplace training on unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment against an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Beginning one year from the effective date of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall provide interactive training to all employees other than those employees covered by subsection c. of this section on the nondiscrimination policy required by section 3 of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment, in the workplace. The training shall be provided to all new employees within 90 days of initial hire, and to all employees at least once every two years. Such training shall include, at minimum: (1)   A statement that unlawful discrimination or harassment in the workplace will not be tolerated and are considered a form of employee misconduct, and that sanctions will be enforced against individuals engaging in discrimination or harassment and against supervisory and managerial personnel who knowingly allow such behavior to continue; (2)   A definition of unlawful discrimination and unlawful harassment in employment; (3)   Examples of discriminatory and harassing behaviors prohibited by the nondiscrimination policy adopted by the employer pursuant to section 3 of P.L.     , c.         (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); (4)   A description of the process for filing internal complaints about such discrimination or harassment; (5)   Directions as to how to contact the division if a person believes their rights were violated; (6)   A description of the prohibition on retaliation against those who disclose, report, participate in an investigation of, or otherwise challenge such discrimination or harassment; (7)   Examples of retaliatory behaviors prohibited by the nondiscrimination policy adopted by the employer pursuant to section 3 of P.L.     , c.         (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and (8)   Information concerning bystander intervention. c.     Beginning one year from the effective date of P.L.     , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), all employers shall provide interactive training to all supervisory employees regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace at least once every two years and shall provide such training to all new supervisory employees within 90 days of initial hire or promotion. Such training shall include, at minimum: (1)   the topics required by paragraphs (1) through (8) of subsection b. of this section; (2)   the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prevention of discrimination and harassment; (3)   the specific responsibilities of a supervisor regarding the prohibitions against retaliation; and (4)   measures and corrective actions supervisors may take to appropriately address complaints and instances of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. d.    All employers shall keep a record of their employees completion of all trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section. Such records may be electronic. Employers shall maintain such records for at least three years and such records must be made available for division inspection upon request. e.     All employers shall review the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section at least annually to ensure that they comply with this section and with other applicable laws and regulations. f.     All employers shall make the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section available: (1)   in English; and (2)   in any language spoken by an employee who does not speak English as their primary language and who has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English, if the division has made the training described in subsection g. of this section available in that language. g.    In addition to any other actions the division may undertake, it shall, within six months of enactment of P.L.     , c.         (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): (1)   develop an online, one-hour training module that satisfies the requirements of subsection b. of this section and that can be used by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; (2)   develop an online, two-hour training module that satisfies the requirements of subsection c. of this section and that can be used by employers with fewer than 50 employees if they choose; and (3)   make the training modules required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection available at no cost on the divisions website in English, Spanish, and any other language deemed appropriate by the director, based on the size of the New Jersey state population that speaks each language and any other factor that the director shall deem relevant. h.    Employers with fewer than 50 employees may comply with the requirements of subsections b. and c. of this section by requiring their employees to view the model nondiscrimination trainings promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section. For any employer that chooses to utilize the model trainings promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section, they may also comply with the requirements of: (1)   subsection e. of this section by ensuring that they utilize the version of the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section in force at the time such training is given; and (2)   subsection f. of this section by directing each employee to the model nondiscrimination trainings made available on the divisions website pursuant to subsection g. of this section in English, Spanish, and any other languages deemed appropriate by the director. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring an employer with fewer than 50 employees to utilize the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division pursuant to subsection g. of this section rather than adopting their own nondiscrimination training that meets the minimum requirements outlined in subsections b. and c. of this section. i.     Employers with 50 or more employees shall provide the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section in a live, in-person setting where participants can ask questions. They may not comply with the requirements of this section by using the model nondiscrimination training promulgated by the division. Such employers shall also provide interpretation at the trainings required by subsections b. and c. of this section for any employee who does not speak English as their primary language and has a limited ability or no ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. j.     For purposes of this section, an employer has 50 or more employees if such employer employs 50 or more employees, whether employed in New Jersey or not, for each work day during each of 20 or more calendar workweeks in the then current or immediately preceding calendar year. k.    For purposes of this section, interactive training means that the training must be participatory. However, except where explicitly required herein, such interactive training is not required to be live or facilitated by an in-person instructor in order to satisfy the provisions of this section. l.     The training required by this section is intended to establish a minimum threshold and should not discourage any employer from providing for longer, more frequent, or more elaborate training regarding workplace harassment or other forms of unlawful discrimination. m.   Notwithstanding any other provision of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), nothing in this section shall be construed to permit a private person to file a complaint with the division or initiate an action in superior court alleging a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), because of any failure to comply with the provisions of this section. However, the Attorney General or the director may enforce violations of this section and may pursue any penalty or remedy available under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), in doing so. An employers compliance with this section, or use of materials provided for herein, shall not, in and of itself, protect the employer from liability for unlawful discrimination or harassment under this act. 5.    (New section)    Mandatory reporting on unlawful employment discrimination and harassment, including sexual harassment. a.     For purposes of this section, the terms discrimination and harassment refer to unlawful discrimination or harassment against an individual because of any characteristic of the individual protected by subsection a. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). b.    Beginning one year after the date of enactment of this act, employers with 50 or more employees shall be required to collect and annually report to the division the following data on complaints received regarding unlawful workplace discrimination or harassment, including sexual harassment, using the form created and made available on the divisions website pursuant to subsection e. of this section for that purpose: the total number of complaints filed; the number of complaints filed that were found by the employer to be substantiated; the number of complaints filed that were found by the employer to be unsubstantiated; the number of complaints filed whose resolution is still pending. c.     The data submitted for each of the categories in subsection b. of this section shall be broken down by how many such complaints involved allegations of unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation, as well as by the protected class or classes that the complainant alleged. d.    Employers shall be required to maintain any records related to the complaints reported to the division pursuant to subsections b. and c. of this section for at least three years and such records must be made available for division inspection upon request. e.     The division shall, within six months of the date of enactment of this act, create a form to be used by employers when submitting the data required to be reported under subsections b. and c. of this section.

(2)   Refuse to grant or accept any letter of credit or other document which evidences the transfer of funds or credit, or refuse to enter into any contract for the exchange of goods or services, on the ground that it does not contain such a discriminatory provision or certification. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any letter of credit, contract, or other document which contains any provision pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, a labor dispute or an unfair labor practice, or made in connection with the protest of unlawful discrimination or an unlawful employment practice, if the other provisions of such letter of credit, contract, or other document do not otherwise violate the provisions of this subsection. n.    For any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, coerce, or induce the doing of any act forbidden by subsections l. and m. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or to attempt, or to conspire to do so.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to [his] the employees religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employees sincerely held religious observance or practice. Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at [his] the persons place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of [his] the persons religion, [he] the person observes as [his] the persons Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between [his] the persons place of employment and [his] the persons home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)   (a)   For purposes of this subsection q., undue hardship means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii)  For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which [he or she] the employee is employed. (d)   (i)    The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer. The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from , discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to , or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. For purposes of this subsection, the definition of employer includes any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work. In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of an employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer. The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work. This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employees rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section pregnancy or breastfeeding means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employers business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employers business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employers operations, including the composition and structure of the employers workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility. An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection. An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity. A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employers operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, member of a protected class means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to preclude employers from engaging interns in unpaid positions or paying interns at a different rate than other staff, provided, however, that if an employer provides compensation to interns, it may not provide such compensation to interns who are members of a protected class at a rate less than interns who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility. (cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.3) 8.    Section 1 of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7) is amended to read as follows: 1.    a.  A provision in any employment contract, including any contract for the performance of domestic work, that waives any substantive or procedural right or remedy relating to a claim of discrimination, retaliation, or harassment shall be deemed against public policy and unenforceable. b.    No right or remedy under the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute or case law shall be prospectively waived. c.     This section shall not apply to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement between an employer and the collective bargaining representative of the employees.

If the employee publicly reveals sufficient details of the claim so that the employer is reasonably identifiable, then the non-disclosure provision shall also be unenforceable against the employer. b.    Every settlement agreement resolving a discrimination, retaliation, or harassment claim by an employee against an employer shall include a bold, prominently placed notice that although the parties may have agreed to keep the settlement and underlying facts confidential, such a provision in an agreement is unenforceable against the employer if the employee publicly reveals sufficient details of the claim so that the employer is reasonably identifiable. c.     Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, this section shall not be construed to prohibit an employer from requiring an employee to sign an agreement: (1)   in which the employee agrees not to enter into competition with the employer during or after employment; or (2)   in which the employee agrees not to disclose proprietary information, which includes only non-public trade secrets, business plan and customer information. d.    For purposes of claims brought this section, the definition of employer includes any person who employs an individual to perform domestic work in their private residence; who employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private residence in which an individual performs domestic work. (cf: P.L.2019, c.39, s.2) 10.  Section 5 of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.11) is amended to read as follows: 5.    Any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7 et seq.) may initiate suit in Superior Court.

All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs. These remedies are in addition to any provided by P.L.2019, c.39 (C.10:5-12.7 et seq.) or any other statute. A prevailing plaintiff shall be awarded reasonable [attorney] attorneys fees and costs. (cf: P.L.2019, c.39, s.5) 11.  Section 12 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-13) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  (1)  Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make, sign, and file with the division a verified complaint in writing which shall state the name and address of the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or agent alleged to have committed the unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination complained of and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and shall contain such other information as may be required by the division.  Such complaint shall be filed with the division or in any municipal office pursuant to P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) within one year after the alleged unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination based on any other category protected by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.).  Upon receipt of the complaint, the division shall notify the complainant on a form promulgated by the director of the division and approved by the Attorney General of the complainant's rights under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), including the right to file a complaint in the Superior Court to be heard before a jury; of the jurisdictional limitations of the division; and any other provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), without interpretation, that may apply to the complaint. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Attorney General, the director, or the Commissioner of Education may, in like manner, make, sign, and file such complaint. Any employer whose employees, or some of them, refuse, or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), may file with the division a verified complaint asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action. (2)   Any complainant, including any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination, the Attorney General, the director, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Commissioner of Education, may initiate suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) without first filing a complaint with the division or any municipal office.  Any such action, other than an action by the Attorney General or the director, shall be commenced within three years after the cause of that action shall have accrued.  In such proceedings: (a)   Upon the application of any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) specified in the suit. (b)   All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs, and if the Attorney General or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, those remedies shall be available on behalf of named or unnamed victims. If the suit seeks relief for one or more unnamed members of a protected class, the Attorney General or the director shall have the discretion to settle the suit on such terms as the Attorney General or the director deems appropriate. The injunctive relief set forth in section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) shall also be available to prevailing plaintiffs. These remedies are in addition to any other provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute.

In the alternative, in lieu of these penalties, the Attorney General or director may seek and obtain punitive damages payable to the State upon a finding that the provisions of P.L.1995, c.142 (C.2A:15-5.9 et al.) are satisfied.

(P.L.2019, c.436, s.5) 12.  Section 17 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-18) is amended to read as follows: The Attorney General shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite and effectuate the foregoing procedure and [his] the Attorney Generals own actions thereunder. Any complaint filed in the division or in any municipal office pursuant to this act must be so filed within [180 days] one year after the alleged act of discrimination or from the discovery of the alleged act of discrimination. (cf: P.L.1979, c.404, s.4) 13.  This act shall take effect of the first day of the third month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill makes it unlawful discrimination in violation of the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) to subject an individual to unlawful harassment, because of the individuals sex or other characteristic protected under that law. The bill sets standards and procedures for determining when unlawful harassment occurs, both for cases of unlawful employment practices and for cases of unlawful discrimination. For a claim that harassment is an unlawful employment practice based on a hostile work environment, determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred is based on factors which include whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, based on the totality of the circumstances, including the cumulative effect of all incidents of harassing conduct affecting all workers in a workplace, regardless of whether or not the conduct involved direct physical contact or threats or loss of job benefits. For a claim that harassment is an unlawful discrimination based on a hostile environment in housing, a school, or other place of public accommodation, determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred is based on the same factors as they would apply to such discrimination. The bill requires employers to establish written nondiscrimination workplace policies to prevent unlawful discrimination and harassment, which explain the policies, and stipulate procedures and remedies for violations.  The Division on Civil Rights is directed to create a model nondiscrimination policy that complies with the requirements of the bill and can be adopted by an employer with fewer than 50 employees, and another model policy specifically for employers of domestic workers. The bill requires an employer to provide interactive training to all supervisory employees and all other employees regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment in the workplace, and sets standards for the training and the responsibilities of supervisors under the bill. The bill also sets requirements for each employer with 50 or more employees regarding the collection and reporting to the division by an employer of data regarding complaints of violations of the provisions of the bill. The bill extends the protections of the Law Against Discrimination to cover domestic workers. The bill sets or extends the periods of time in which certain actions regarding unlawful discrimination may be taken.
