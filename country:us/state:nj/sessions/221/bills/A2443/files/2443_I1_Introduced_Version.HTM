<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)    Legislative
findings and declarations concerning unlawful harassment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Legislature finds and
declares: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The purpose of this
section is to affirm that the right to be free from discrimination in
employment, housing, business relationships, and places of public accommodation
includes the right to be free from unlawful harassment based on any
characteristic protected by the Law Against Discrimination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Among the goals of this
act is to codify the standard for hostile environment harassment claims set
forth in <u>Lehmann</u> v. <u>Toys R Us, Inc.</u>, 132 <u>N.J.</u> 587 (1993); <u>Taylor</u>
v. <u>Metzger</u>, 152 <u>N.J.</u> 490 (1998); <u>L.W.</u> v. <u>Toms River
Regional Schools Board of Education</u>, 189 <u>N.J.</u> 381 (2007); and
Justice Ginsburgs concurrence in <u>Harris</u> v. <u>Forklift Systems</u>, 510
<u>U.S.</u> 17, 26 (1993) (Ginsburg, J., concurring). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     It is the further
intent of the Legislature to disavow interpretations of the standard for
hostile environment harassment claims under the Law Against Discrimination
found in decisions such as <u>Clayton</u> v. <u>City of Atlantic City</u>, 538
Fed. <u>Appx.</u> 124, 129 (3d Cir. 2013), in which the court held that an
incident in which a supervisor intentionally grabbed an employees buttocks did
not rise to the level of severe or pervasive conduct; <u>Godfrey</u> v. <u>Princeton

held that incidents must be described in sterile terms, stripped of the
overlay of (the plaintiffs) subjective reactions to these interactions,
because, in the courts view, those reactions were not relevant to the
determination of whether the conduct is severe or pervasive, and held that the
alleged harassers repeated and unwelcome behavior was one of the socially
uncomfortable situations that many women encounter in the course of their lives
when someone in whom they are not interested persists in trying to persuade
them otherwise.; <u>id.</u> at 201 (harassing conduct not directed at or

environment claim); and <u>Anastasia</u> v. <u>Cushman Wakefield</u>, 455 <u>Fed.

jury could find severe or pervasive harassment where: the plaintiffs superior
informed her that he was romantically attracted to her and had been for
years, and then, over that day and the following day, followed her to the
parking lot and gently grabbed her arm, asked her for a photograph of her and
her new boyfriend, and concocted a pretext to have (the plaintiff) meet him alone
in a break room; the plaintiff immediately took a temporary leave of absence,
while her superior continued to call and send emails and text messages to her,
despite her repeated statements that his further contact was unwanted; and the
plaintiff refused to return to work when her employer refused to create an
arrangement under which she would not ultimately have to report to the alleged
harasser, and her employer terminated her while she was out on leave, but
treated the action as a voluntary resignation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   A determination of
whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall be based upon the
totality of the circumstances. In evaluating the severity or pervasiveness of
the alleged harassing conduct, the cumulative effect of all incidents of
harassing conduct shall be considered as a whole rather than considering
individual incidents in isolation, provided, however, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>that a single incident of harassing

consider all evidence, including de minimis or isolated incidents, when

an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment shall include a
consideration of whether a reasonable person in complainants protected class

conditions of employment, provided that a complainants subjective responses to
the harassing conduct shall be considered as part of the totality of the
circumstances that are relevant to whether a reasonable person belonging to the
same protected class would consider the conduct to be sufficiently severe or
pervasive to alter the conditions of employment. In addition, the complainants
knowledge of harassment directed to others may be relevant to evaluating
whether a hostile work environment exists, whether or not the complainant
witnessed the harassing conduct. </p>

section, harassing conduct may include but not be limited to physical contact
or gestures, threats, abusive or offensive language, damage to or interference
with personal property, or offensive written or verbal communications or
comments, whether such conduct is of a sexual nature or otherwise. Harassing
conduct shall not be construed to require physical contact to qualify as severe
or pervasive. </p>

knew or should have known of the harassing conduct and failed to take
appropriate preventive or corrective action.</p>

take appropriate preventive or corrective action. However, in reviewing cases
involving the acts of non-employees, consideration shall be given to the extent
of the entitys control and any other responsibility that the entity may have
with respect to the conduct of those non-employees. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   Nothing in this

employs an individual to perform domestic work in the private residence of a
family member; or who is 18 years of age or older and resides in a private
residence in which an individual performs domestic work. For purposes of such claims
brought by an employee who performs domestic work, it shall also be an unlawful
employment practice for an employer to allow any family member or member of
their household, regardless of age, to engage in unlawful harassment based on
any other category protected by this subsection, or for an employer to keep or

the employers operations, including the composition and structure of the
employers workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into

P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), without interpretation, that may apply to
the complaint. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the
Attorney General, the director, or the Commissioner of Education may, in like
manner, make, sign, and file such complaint. Any employer whose employees, or
some of them, refuse, or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of

Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Commissioner of
Education, may initiate suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1
et seq.) without first filing a complaint with the division or any municipal
office.  <u>Any such action, other than an action by the Attorney General or
the director, shall be commenced within three years after the cause of that action
shall have accrued.</u>  In such proceedings: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   Upon the application of
any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim
under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) specified in the suit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   All remedies available
in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs, and if
the Attorney General or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, those remedies
shall be available on behalf of named or unnamed victims. If the suit seeks
relief for one or more unnamed members of a protected class, the Attorney
General or the director shall have the discretion to settle the suit on such
terms as the Attorney General or the director deems appropriate. The injunctive
relief set forth in section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) shall also be
available to prevailing plaintiffs. These remedies are in addition to any other
provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute. </p>

these penalties, the Attorney General or director may seek and obtain punitive
damages payable to the State upon a finding that the provisions of P.L.1995,
c.142 (C.2A:15-5.9 et al.) are satisfied. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prosecution of such suit in
Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall bar the filing of
a complaint with the division or any municipal office during the pendency of
any such suit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   If a jury or court
determines that an employer has committed an unlawful employment practice
prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12),
the judge shall award three times any monetary damages to the person or persons
aggrieved by the violation. </p>

General or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, the court shall award
reasonable attorneys fees and litigation and investigation costs. </p>

days from the filing of a complaint with the division, a complainant may file a
request with the division to present the action personally or through counsel
to the Office of Administrative Law. Upon such request, the director of the
division shall file the action with the Office of Administrative Law, provided
that no action may be filed with the Office of Administrative Law where the
director of the division has found that no probable cause exists to credit the
allegations of the complaint or has otherwise dismissed the complaint. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill makes it unlawful
discrimination in violation of the Law Against Discrimination, P.L.1945,
c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) to subject an individual to unlawful harassment,
because of the individuals sex or other characteristic protected under that
law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets standards and
procedures for determining when unlawful harassment occurs, both for cases of
unlawful employment practices and for cases of unlawful discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For a claim that harassment is
an unlawful employment practice based on a hostile work environment,
determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred is based on factors which
include whether the harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to
create an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment, based on the
totality of the circumstances, including the cumulative effect of all incidents
of harassing conduct affecting all workers in a workplace, regardless of
whether or not the conduct involved direct physical contact or threats or loss
of job benefits. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For a claim that harassment is
an unlawful discrimination based on a hostile environment in housing, a school,
or other place of public accommodation, determining whether unlawful harassment
has occurred is based on the same factors as they would apply to such
discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires employers to
establish written nondiscrimination workplace policies to prevent unlawful
discrimination and harassment, which explain the policies, and stipulate
procedures and remedies for violations.  The Division on Civil Rights is
directed to create a model nondiscrimination policy that complies with the
requirements of the bill and can be adopted by an employer with fewer than 50
employees, and another model policy specifically for employers of domestic
workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires an employer
to provide interactive training to all supervisory employees and all other
employees regarding the prevention of unlawful discrimination and harassment in
the workplace, and sets standards for the training and the responsibilities of
supervisors under the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also sets
requirements for each employer with 50 or more employees regarding the
collection and reporting to the division by an employer of data regarding
complaints of violations of the provisions of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill extends the
protections of the Law Against Discrimination to cover domestic workers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill sets or extends the
periods of time in which certain actions regarding unlawful discrimination may
be taken.</p>
