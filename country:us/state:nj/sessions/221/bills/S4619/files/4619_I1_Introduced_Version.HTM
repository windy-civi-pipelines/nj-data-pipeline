<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends the definition
of the term principal business operations, which term is used, in part, to
determine eligibility for qualified businesses under the program.  Under
current law, for the purposes of the program, principal business operations means
any of the following: (1) at least 50 percent of the business's employees not
primarily engaged in retail sales reside in the State; (2) at least 50 percent
of the business's payroll for employees not primarily engaged in retail sales
is paid to individuals living in the State; (3) at least 50 percent of the
business's full-time employees not primarily engaged in retail sales are filling
a position in the State; or (4) at least 50 percent of the business's payroll
for employees not primarily engaged in retail sales is paid to full-time
employees filling a position in the State.  The bill expands the scope of this
definition to also include any instance in which: the businesss headquarters
is located in the State; and of all states, the largest percentage of the
businesss full-time employees, who based in the United States and are not
primarily engaged in retail sales, are located in New Jersey.<br clear=all

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Determination of Qualified
Investments</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the program, the New
Jersey Economic Development Authority is authorized to allocate monies,
generated from the proceeds of tax credit auctions, to one or more qualified
venture firms based on the amount of qualified investments made by each firm to
qualified businesses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the term
qualified investment means the direct investment of money by the fund in a
qualified business for the purchase of shares of stock, with an option to make
an additional investment in an option or warrant or a follow-on investment, in
the discretion of the authority, all of which is matched by an investment by a
qualified venture firm.  Current law also provides that the amount of each
qualified investment may not exceed $5 million in initial investment, exclusive
of follow-on investments, provided certain exceptions. Namely, a maximum
qualified investment of $6.25 million may be earned for initial investments
made to any qualified business that meets one of the following criteria: (1)
utilizes intellectual property that is core to its business model and was
developed at a New Jersey-based college or university; (2) is considered a
university spin-off business as determined by the authority; or (c) is
certified by the State as a minority business or a womens business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends current law
to require that a qualified investment either:  (1) match a qualified venture
firms initial investment in a qualified business for the purchase of shares of
stock; or (2) in instances where the venture firm has a prior investment in the
qualified business, occur at a higher valuation compared to the venture firms
prior investments into the qualified business, as established by an independent
third-party valuation or through participation by a third-party investor at the
same valuation as the qualified venture firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill increases the maximum
amount of the qualified investment that may be earned for initial investments
in qualified businesses.  Under the bill, the maximum qualified investment that
may be earned for an initial investment is $10 million, provided certain
exceptions.  Additionally, the bill increases to $12.5 million the maximum
qualified investment that may be earned for initial investments in any
qualified business that: (1) utilizes intellectual property that is core to its
business model and was developed at a New Jersey-based college or university;
(2) is considered a university spin-off business as determined by the
authority; or (3) is certified by the State as a minority business or a womens
business.</p>

authority from undertaking a tax credit auction if, exclusive of reserves, more
than $15 million is available to the authority from monies received from any
prior auction of tax credits pursuant to the program.  The bill amends this
provision to prohibit the authority from undertaking an auction if more than
$50 million is available from these monies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><i>Reporting Requirements</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A qualified venture firm is
required to annually report certain information to the authority under the
program.  Current law requires that the report include a statement prepared by
a certified public accountant, certifying that the accountant has reviewed the
report and that the information and representations contained in the report are
accurate. Specifically, a qualified venture firm is required to include such
statements for the following: (1) the amount of the qualified investment, if
any, uninvested at the end of the preceding calendar year; (2) all qualified
investments made during the preceding calendar year, including the number and
wages of employees of each qualified business at the time the venture firm made
the qualified investment and as of December 31 of that year; (3) for any
qualified investment in which the qualified venture firm no longer has a
position as of the end of the calendar year, the number of employees of the
business as of the date the investment was terminated; and (4) financials,
audited by a certified public accountant, of the qualified venture firm and the
special purpose vehicle, which include a consolidated summary of the
performance of the qualified venture firm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends current law to
provide that a qualified venture firm is only required to include a certified public
accountants statement to review and accuracy for financials, audited by a
certified public accountant, of the qualified venture firm and the special
purpose vehicle that include a consolidated summary of the performance of the
qualified venture firm.</p>
