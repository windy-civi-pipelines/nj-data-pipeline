The bill requires the commissioner to approve or conditionally approve each program plan within 30 calendar days of receipt.  If the commissioner conditionally approves a program plan, the plan would be deemed approved when the board of education adopts all revisions contained in the conditional approval.  Thereafter, an impact district may modify its after school community learning program by submitting a revised program plan to the commissioner for approval. Under the bill, the department would be required to annually distribute such funding as is necessary to each impact district to defray the full costs of implementing the after school community learning program.  The bill requires all State funds received by an impact district to be accounted for in a special revenue fund and used exclusively to implement the after school community learning program.  The bill provides that an impact district would not be required to implement an after school community learning program during any year in which State funding is not provided pursuant to this bill. The bill also establishes the New Jersey Community Learning Assistance Fund, which would be used to distribute program funding to impact districts.  Beginning in State Fiscal Year 2022, the bill requires the State to annually deposit into the assistance fund an amount determined by the Cannabis Regulatory Commission from the State revenue collected from the tax imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.) on the retail sale of recreational cannabis products.  However, if in any year, these amounts are insufficient to support the full distribution of funding to impact districts, the State would be required to appropriate such additional amounts as are necessary from the Property Tax Relief Fund to the assistance fund. This bill would take effect on the date of enactment, or on the effective date of an amendment to the State Constitution to legalize cannabis for personal, non-medical use by adults who are 21 years of age or older, whichever occurs later.
