STATEMENT This bill requires the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services in the Department of Human Services to provide social adult day care services for Medicaid beneficiaries, regardless of whether the beneficiaries are enrolled in the States Medicaid Managed Long Term Services and Supports (MLTSS) program.  This benefit, however, would be limited to those Medicaid beneficiaries who are aged 60 years or older and who also meet the clinical, income, and asset requirements established for the MLTSS program by the Commissioner of Human Services. The bill defines social adult day care services as a community-based group program designed to meet the non-medical needs of senior citizens with functional impairments through an individualized plan of care.  Social adult day care services are provided in a protective setting when participants caregivers are at work or are otherwise unavailable. Pursuant to the bill, the Commissioner of Human Services is to apply for any federal Medicaid waivers or State plan amendments necessary to secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program.  The bill additionally stipulates that the provisions therein are to remain inoperable until the Commissioner of Human Services receives federal approval of the requisite federal Medicaid waivers or State plan amendments. Under current law, only Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in the MLTSS program are eligible for social adult day care or medical day care services.  Beneficiaries enrolled in a medical day care program receive preventive, diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitative services under medical and nursing supervision in order to support their ability to live in the community.  To qualify for the MLTSS program, individuals must be enrolled in the State Medicaid program, reside in the community, require a nursing home level of care, and meet the programs income and asset limits.
