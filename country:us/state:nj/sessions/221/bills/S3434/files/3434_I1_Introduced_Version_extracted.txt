STATEMENT This bill clarifies certain current law regarding coverage for over-the-counter contraceptive drugs by insurers authorized to provide health benefits in the State.  Specifically, the bill clarifies that various insurers are required to provide coverage for either the requested prescriptive contraceptive drugs, devices, and products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the therapeutic equivalents.  Medical necessity for over-the-counter contraceptive drugs is also deemed to be present under the coverage of the various health insurers in the State.  Additionally, point-of-sale coverage for over-the-counter female contraceptives is to be provided without cost-sharing or medical management restrictions.  Lastly, the bill further delineates the type of family planning programs that provide benefits for contraceptives and establishes that Medicaid and the other family planning programs are to provide coverage for over-the-counter contraceptives and pharmacy-furnished self-administered hormonal contraceptives with no requirement for a prescription or provider order.
