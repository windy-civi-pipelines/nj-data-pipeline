A4247 ASSEMBLY, No. 4247 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 2, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  DAWN FANTASIA District 24 (Morris, Sussex and Warren) SYNOPSIS Designates month of November as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Awareness Month in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act designating the month of November as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Awareness Month in New Jersey and amending P.L.2007, c.255. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Section 2 of P.L.2007, c.255 (C.26:2AA-2) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), also known as complex regional pain syndrome, is a debilitating and progressively chronic condition characterized by severe burning pain, pathological changes in bone and skin, excessive sweating, tissue swelling and extreme sensitivity to touch [;] . b.    More specifically, RSDS is thought to be a nerve disorder that generally occurs at the site of a minor or major trauma injury, but may also occur without an apparent injury to the afflicted person [;] . c.     While the causes of RSDS are unknown, the syndrome is thought to be the result of damaged nerves of the sympathetic nervous system[;] . d.    The disorder is unique in that it simultaneously affects the nerves, skin, muscles, blood vessels and bones, and if untreated, can result in permanent deformity and chronic pain [;] . e.     RSDS is often misdiagnosed because this condition is either unknown or is poorly understood; the prognosis for patients suffering from RSDS is generally much better when the condition is identified and treated as early as possible, ideally within three months of identifying the first symptoms[;] .  Treatments aimed at relieving pain include, but are not limited to: physical therapy, medications, nerve blocks, surgical sympathectomy, spinal cord stimulation, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. f.     If treatment is delayed, the disorder can quickly spread to the entire limb, and changes in bone and muscle may become irreversible, resulting in limited mobility, atrophy of the muscles and eventual permanent disability of patients[; and] . g.    Since a delay in diagnosis or treatment for this syndrome can result in severe physical and physiological problems, and early recognition and prompt treatment of RSDS provides the greatest opportunity for recovery, it is in the best interest of the public to establish a program to educate both individuals and medical professionals regarding this debilitative condition and to promote research to accurately identify, diagnose and treat RSDS. h.    It is appropriate to designate a month to increase public awareness and to better inform the citizens of this State about the importance of research and funding for RSDS. i.     It is imperative for New Jersey to commit itself to actively support public awareness and education efforts throughout the State in order to better meet the needs of its citizens who are suffering from RSDS. (cf: P.L.2007, c.255, s.2). 2.    Section 4 of P.L.2007, c.255 (C.26:2AA-4) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.   The commissioner shall establish a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome education and research program in the Department of Health.  The purpose of the program is to promote public awareness of the causes of RSDS, the value of early detection and the diagnosis of and possible treatments for the syndrome, and to promote research, through public and private sources, to accurately identify, diagnose, and treat RSDS. b.    The month of November each year is designated as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Month and the Governor is requested to annually issue a proclamation calling upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs to increase public awareness and highlight the importance of research and funding for RSDS. (cf: P.L.2012, c.17, s.145) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill designates the month of November as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome Awareness Month in New Jersey, and requests that the Governor issue an annual proclamation calling on public officials and citizens of the State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS), also known as complex regional pain syndrome, is a debilitating and progressively chronic condition characterized by severe burning pain, pathological changes in bone and skin, excessive sweating, tissue swelling, and extreme sensitivity to touch.  In 2007, New Jersey established a reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome education and research program in the Department of Health in order to increase public awareness of the causes of RSDS, promote the value of early detection and the diagnosis of and possible treatments for the syndrome, and support research, through public and private sources, to accurately identify, diagnose, and treat RSDS.
