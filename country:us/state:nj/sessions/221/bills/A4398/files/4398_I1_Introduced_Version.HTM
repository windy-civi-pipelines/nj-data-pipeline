<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 2 of P.L.2018,
c.33 (C.5:12A-11) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  The division shall
issue all sports wagering licenses and renewals thereof to casinos.  The racing
commission shall issue all initial sports wagering licenses to racetracks but
the division shall have responsibility for the renewal thereof.  In addition to
casino games permitted pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-1
et seq.), a casino which holds a sports wagering license issued by the division
may operate a sports pool in accordance with the provisions of this act and
applicable regulations promulgated pursuant to this act.  A racetrack which
holds an initial sports wagering license issued by the racing commission or a
sports wagering license that has been renewed by the division may operate a
sports pool in accordance with the provisions of this act and applicable
regulations promulgated pursuant to this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division may issue a
transactional waiver to allow the continued operation of an established sports
wagering lounge and authorization to conduct up to three online sports wagering
operations when a racetrack that holds a license issued by the racing
commission pursuant to P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-22, et seq.) undergoes a material
change in ownership to a degree such that it would be required to file a new
application with the racing commission in order to continue to operate pursuant
to P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-22 et seq.).  A transactional waiver issued pursuant
to this section shall be for an initial period of up to six months and may be
renewed during the pendency of the racing commission's consideration of a new
application for up to three one-year periods, but the division shall have the
right to reexamine and rescind the grant of the waiver at any time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A racetrack at which a permit
holder has scheduled a standardbred horse race meeting within one year
preceding the effective date of P.L.2018, c.33 (C.5:12A-10 et al.) and that met
the definition of a racetrack under P.L.2018, c.33 (C.5:12A-10 et al.) on the
effective date thereof:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     shall not be permitted to hold
a sports wagering license as a former racetrack on or after the effective date
of P.L.2021, c.350, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     shall, as a condition of
holding a sports wagering license after the effective date of P.L.2021, c.350,
schedule annually no fewer than 151 standardbred race dates, except that the
annual number of scheduled standardbred race dates may be decreased to no fewer
than 75 standardbred race dates upon written consent from the Standardbred
Breeders' and Owners' Association of New Jersey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A casino which holds a sports
wagering license and a racetrack which holds a sports wagering license may
enter into an agreement to jointly operate a sports pool at the racetrack, in
accordance with the provisions of this act and applicable regulations
promulgated pursuant to this act.  A casino or racetrack that holds a sports
wagering license may conduct an online sports pool or may authorize an internet
sports pool operator licensed as a casino service industry enterprise pursuant
to section 92 of P.L.1977, c.110 (C.5:12-92), or an applicant for such license,
to operate an online sports pool on its behalf provided the terms of the agreement
are approved by the division; provided, however, that each sports wagering
licensee may provide no more than three individually branded websites, each of
which may have an accompanying mobile application bearing the same brand as the
website for an online sports pool, those websites and mobile applications, in
the case of a casino being in addition to or, in the discretion of the casino,
in conjunction with, any websites and mobile applications that also offer other
types of Internet gaming pursuant to P.L.2013, c.27 (C.5:12-95.17 et seq.).  No
online sports pool shall be opened to the public, and no sports wagering,
except for test purposes, may be conducted therein, until an Internet sports
pool operator receives approval from the division to conduct an online sports
pool on behalf of a casino or racetrack that holds a sports wagering license. 
Sports wagering licensees and operators may provide promotional credits,
incentives, bonuses, complimentaries, or similar benefits designed to induce
sports betters to wager.  The division, in consultation with the commission,
shall establish by rule standards governing the provision of these measures. 
The server or other equipment used by a racetrack to accept wagers at a sports
pool or online sports pool shall be located in that racetrack or in any
location in Atlantic City which conforms to the requirements of section 20 of
P.L.2013, c.27 (C.5:12-95.22) and any additional requirements which the
division may impose by regulation.  The server or other equipment used by a
casino to accept wagers at a sports pool or online sports pool shall conform to
