The division may issue a transactional waiver to allow the continued operation of an established sports wagering lounge and authorization to conduct up to three online sports wagering operations when a racetrack that holds a license issued by the racing commission pursuant to P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-22, et seq.) undergoes a material change in ownership to a degree such that it would be required to file a new application with the racing commission in order to continue to operate pursuant to P.L.1940, c.17 (C.5:5-22 et seq.).  A transactional waiver issued pursuant to this section shall be for an initial period of up to six months and may be renewed during the pendency of the racing commission's consideration of a new application for up to three one-year periods, but the division shall have the right to reexamine and rescind the grant of the waiver at any time.

In the event such rules are not complied with within such time period, the non-complying racetrack or casino will not thereafter be eligible to conduct sports wagering until such compliance is achieved. Notice of any emergency rulemaking action taken by the division or the racing commission pursuant to this subsection shall be published in the New Jersey Register, and provided to the newspapers designated by the division and racing commission pursuant to subsection d. of section 3 of P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-8), not later than 30 days subsequent to the implementation of the emergency rules.

The bill directs the division to investigate such reports and authorizes them to take remedial action as deemed necessary.  The division may exclude individuals who have credibly been found to have engaged in harassment or coercive behavior related to sports wagering from engaging in sports wagering activities in this state.  The division may also refer reports of harassment or coercive behavior to the relevant sports governing bodies, or to law enforcement or the Attorney General for a criminal investigation. The bill requires the division and the racing commission following consultation with the sports wagering licensees, sport governing bodies, athletic conferences, and collegiate athletics programs to prepare an annual report to the Governor on the impact of sports wagering, including Internet wagering on sports events, on problem gamblers, the harassment or coercion of participants in sporting events or other acts which affect the integrity of athletes or competitors, sporting or athletic competitions, or sports wagering operations, and gambling addiction in New Jersey. This bill requires licensed operators to promptly report to the division and any relevant sports governing body any conduct with the potential to corrupt a betting outcome of a sports event for purposes of financial gain, including but not limited to the harassment or coercion of participants in any sporting event or athletic competitions, or match fixing. This bill also requires the division, in consultation with the commission, to promulgate regulations governing sports pool related advertising of sports wagering licensees, their employees and agents, and their contracted operators, to ensure their advertisements are not deceptive or fraudulent and do not appeal directly to, or feature, individuals under the legal age to wager and to ensure that such advertisements warn users of any prohibited actions related to sports wagering, identify where and how an individual may report the conduct of any prohibited actions, and the consequences of engaging in any prohibited conduct.
