Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  Section 4 of P.L.1995,
c.244 (C.2A:50-56) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.  a.  Upon failure to
perform any obligation of a residential mortgage by the residential mortgage
debtor and before any residential mortgage lender may accelerate the maturity
of any residential mortgage obligation and commence any foreclosure or other
legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the
subject of the mortgage, the residential mortgage lender shall give a notice of
intention, which shall include a notice of the right to cure the default as
provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), at least 30 days, but
not more than 180 days, in advance of such action as provided in this section,
to the residential mortgage debtor, and, if the mortgage is secured by a
residence for which a restriction on affordability was recorded in the county
in which the property is located, the clerk of the municipality in which the
subject property is located, the municipal housing liaison, if one has been
appointed by the municipality pursuant to the regulations of the Council on
Affordable Housing, and the Commissioner of Community Affairs.  For the
purposes of this section, &quot;restriction on affordability&quot; means any
conditions recorded with a mortgage or a deed which would limit the sale of
such property to income qualified households pursuant to the rules adopted to
effectuate the &quot;Fair Housing Act,&quot; P.L.1985, c.222 (C.52:27D-301 et
al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Notice of intention to
take action as specified in subsection a. of this section shall be in writing,
provided to the Department of Community Affairs in accordance with subsection
a. of section 2 of P.L.2019, c.134 (C.46:10B-49.2), sent to the debtor by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at the debtor's last
known address, and, if different, to the address of the property which is the
subject of the residential mortgage.  The notice is deemed to have been
effectuated on the date the notice is delivered in person or mailed to the
party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The written notice
shall clearly and conspicuously state in a manner calculated to make the debtor
aware of the situation:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the particular
obligation or real estate security interest;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the nature of the
default claimed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the right of the debtor
to cure the default as provided in section 5 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57);</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   what performance,
including what sum of money, if any, and interest, shall be tendered to cure
the default as of the date specified under paragraph (5) of this subsection c.;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   the date by which the
debtor shall cure the default to avoid initiation of foreclosure proceedings,
which date shall not be less than 30 days after the date the notice is
effective, and the name and address and phone number of a person to whom the
payment or tender shall be made;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   that if the debtor does
not cure the default by the date specified under paragraph (5) of this
subsection c., the lender may take steps to terminate the debtor's ownership in
the property by commencing a foreclosure suit in a court of competent
jurisdiction;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   that if the lender takes
the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection c., a debtor
shall still have the right to cure the default pursuant to section 5 of
P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-57), but that the debtor shall be responsible for the
lender's court costs and attorneys' fees in an amount not to exceed that amount
permitted pursuant to the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New
Jersey;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   the right, if any, of
the debtor to transfer the real estate to another person subject to the
security interest and that the transferee may have the right to cure the
default as provided in P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-53 et seq.), subject to the
mortgage documents;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   that the debtor is
advised to seek counsel from an attorney of the debtor's own choosing
concerning the debtor's residential mortgage default situation, and that, if
the debtor is unable to obtain an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the
New Jersey Bar Association or Lawyer Referral Service in the county in which
the residential property securing the mortgage loan is located; and that, if
the debtor is unable to afford an attorney, the debtor may communicate with the
Legal Services Office in the county in which the property is located;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  the possible
availability of financial assistance for curing a default from programs operated
by the State or federal government or nonprofit organizations, if any, as
identified by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance and, if the property is
subject to restrictions on affordability, the address and phone number of the
municipal affordable housing liaison and of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage
Finance Agency.  This requirement shall be satisfied by attaching a list of
such programs promulgated by the commissioner;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  the name and address of
the lender and the telephone number of a representative of the lender whom the
debtor may contact if the debtor disagrees with the lender's assertion that a
default has occurred or the correctness of the mortgage lender's calculation of
the amount required to cure the default; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)  that if the lender takes
the steps indicated pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subsection, the debtor
has the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program following
the filing of a mortgage foreclosure complaint by initiating mediation pursuant
to paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 4 of P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-77). 
Notice of the option to participate in the Foreclosure Mediation Program shall
