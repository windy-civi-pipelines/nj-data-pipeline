costs; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   0.5 percent, 1.0
percent, 1.5 percent, or 2.0 percent of allowable costs, attributable to

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Department of
Community Affairs, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Division
of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury shall jointly adopt, pursuant to
the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et
seq.), such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement this act. 
These rules and regulations shall be designed to encourage the implementation
of green building principles and maintain high but commercially reasonable
standards for obtaining tax credits under this act.  The rules and regulations
shall establish a reasonable time for submission of applications and shall
establish a method of allocating credit reservation certificates pursuant to
section 4 of this act among eligible applicants, which shall generally be on a
first-come, first-served basis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     On or before six years
after the effective date of this act, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, in
consultation with the Commissioner of Environmental Protection and the Director
of the Division of Taxation, shall prepare and submit a written report
regarding the number of certificates and taxpayers applying the credit provided
for under this act, the amount of the credits granted, the geographical
distribution of the credits granted, and any other information that the
Department of Community Affairs, the Department of Environmental Protection, or
the Division of Taxation may deem useful or appropriate.  An initial draft of
the report shall be so issued within the first four years following the
effective date of this act.  The report shall be submitted to the Governor and,
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 <br>
(C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.   To be eligible for
a tax credit pursuant to section 3 of this act, a taxpayer shall submit an
application, in writing, to the Department of Community Affairs for a credit
reservation certificate.  The Department of Community Affairs shall issue a
credit reservation certificate if the taxpayer has made a showing that the
taxpayer is likely, within a reasonable time, to place in service the building
for which a credit is sought, and that the building would qualify for the
allowance of a credit pursuant to section 3 of this act.  The certificate shall
state (1) the earliest tax year for which the credit may be applied, (2) the
maximum amount of the total credit allowed and the maximum amount of credit
allowed in any single tax year, (3) an expiration date, and (4) such other
information as the Department of Community Affairs may prescribe.  The
certificate shall apply only to the building placed in service by the specified
expiration date.  The expiration date may be extended at the discretion of the
Commissioner of Community Affairs in order to avoid undue hardship.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Department of
Community Affairs shall not issue a credit reservation certificate pursuant to
subsection a. of this section for any building that received the required
permit authorizing the construction or retrofitting of the building, as
appropriate, prior to the effective date of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    a.  For the first year
for which a taxpayer intends to apply a credit under this act, the taxpayer shall
obtain an eligibility certificate from the Department of Community Affairs. 
The Department of Community Affairs shall issue an eligibility certificate to a
taxpayer if the taxpayer has provided:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   a certification from an
architect or professional engineer, licensed to practice in New Jersey, that
the building with respect to which the credit is applied meets either:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   the green building
standards prescribed and adopted pursuant to section 7 of this act; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   the criteria required
for Certified, Silver, Gold, or Platinum status under the LEED Green Building
Rating System or LEED Residential Green Building Rating System;</p>

certificate obtained pursuant to section 4 of this act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   a certificate of
occupancy, for the building or buildings that are the subject of the credit; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   a statement that the
building or buildings shall remain in service during that year; and </p>

the credit for which the taxpayer is eligible and any other information that
the Department of Community Affairs may prescribe.  Upon certification, the
Commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs shall submit a copy of the
eligibility certificate to the taxpayer and the Director of the Division of
Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Department of Community
Affairs shall not issue an eligibility certificate pursuant to this section to
a taxpayer for any building that received the required permit authorizing the
construction or retrofitting of the building, as appropriate, prior to the
effective date of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the Department of
Community Affairs has reason to believe that an architect or professional
engineer, in making any certification under this section, engaged in
professional misconduct, the department shall so inform the New Jersey State
Board of Architects, or the State Board of Professional Engineers and Land
Surveyors, as appropriate, in the Division of Consumer Affairs of the

this act, the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury shall
allow a credit, provided that the credits, in the aggregate, shall not exceed
$20 million for the first fiscal year of tax credit availability and, in each
of the subsequent six fiscal years, shall not exceed $50 million; provided further
that any unused allocable amounts shall roll over to subsequent fiscal years.

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    For any tax year, a
taxpayer may apply no more than 20 percent of the total amount allowed under
section 3 of this act.  The amount of tax credit otherwise allowed under
section 3 of this act, which cannot be applied during a tax year, may be
carried over, if necessary, to the 15 tax years following a credit's first
eligible tax year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     If a credit is owed to
a building owner under this act with respect to property, and the property, or
an interest therein, is sold, the credit for the period after the sale which
would have been allowed under this act to the prior owner had the property not
been sold shall be allowed to the successor owner if that right is specified in
the deed transferring the property and the Department of Community Affairs and
the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury are notified of the
transaction and intended distribution of the credit.  If the credit is not
transferred pursuant to this subsection, then the remaining credit shall remain
with the prior building owner.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The amount of credit
granted under this act to a New Jersey S corporation or an entity classified as
a partnership for federal tax purposes shall be passed through to the partners,
members, shareholders, or owners respectively, either in proportion to their
ownership interest in the equity or as the partners, members, shareholders, or
owners mutually agree as provided in an executed document detailing the
alternate distribution method.   The entity shall notify the Department of
Community Affairs and the Division of Taxation of the relevant ownership
interests and the intended distribution method in the taxpayers application
for the tax credit.  </p>

the time that the two agencies shall determine.</p>

or other items relevant to compliance with the standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within one year after
the effective date of this act, the Department of Community Affairs, in

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the
&quot;Green Building Tax Credit Act,&quot; provides tax credits toward the
corporation business tax, gross income tax, and certain other specified taxes
for developers and owners who design and construct buildings and owners who
retrofit buildings to meet certain &quot;green building&quot; criteria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that
developers or owners of newly constructed and retrofitted buildings would

set forth in section 7 of the bill to be adopted by the Department of Community
Affairs (DCA) in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP), or if the building meets the criteria required for Certified, Silver,
Gold, or Platinum status under the LEED Green Building Rating System or LEED
Residential Green Building Rating System.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The &quot;Green Building Tax
Credit Act&quot; would be administered by the DCA in consultation with the DEP
