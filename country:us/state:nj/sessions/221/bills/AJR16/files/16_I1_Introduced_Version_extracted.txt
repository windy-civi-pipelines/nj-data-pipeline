CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. A Joint Resolution pursuant to P.L.1960, c.52 proposing a new Rule of Evidence. Whereas, Fresh complaint evidence that the victim of the crime reported the sexual assault or employment discrimination shortly after it occurred is admissible as bearing on the declarants credibility, a non-truth purpose; and Whereas, Fresh complaint evidence is necessary to rebut the adverse inference a jury would draw if not presented with proof of a timely complaint; and Whereas, Fresh complaint evidence will serve to corroborate the allegation that sexual assault or employment discrimination took place; and Whereas, The fresh complaint evidence will aid in explaining the investigative process and completing the narrative of events leading to a defendants arrest; and Whereas, Section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38) provides a procedure for the adoption of Rules of Evidence without necessity for presentation at the Judicial Conference so that their adoption by the Supreme Court may be accelerated; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    Pursuant to section 38 of P.L.1960, c.52 (C.2A:84A-38), the Supreme Court of New Jersey may adopt the rule specified in this section in the form set out, at any time after this Joint Resolution has been delivered to and signed by the Governor of the State of New Jersey, by entering an order that the rule is adopted and by causing true copies of its order of adoption to be delivered to the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the General Assembly, and the Governor, without again presenting the subject matter and a tentative draft of rules at a Judicial Conference.
