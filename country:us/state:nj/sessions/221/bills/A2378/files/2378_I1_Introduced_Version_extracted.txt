It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session.

It shall not be a defense that the defendant did not know that the child was present or reasonably believed that the child was 16 years of age or older. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to create any liability on the part of a participant in a youth sports event or to abrogate any immunity or defense available to a participant in a youth sports event.  As used in this act, "school or community sponsored youth sports event" means a competition, practice, or instructional event involving one or more interscholastic sports teams or youth sports teams organized pursuant to a nonprofit or similar charter or which are member teams in a youth league organized by or affiliated with a county or municipal recreation department and shall not include collegiate, semi-professional or professional sporting events.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.219, s.4) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill upgrades certain penalties for assaulting a law enforcement officer.  The bill also increases the penalty for assault with bodily fluids if the victim is a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or person engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services and suffers bodily injury. Under current law, it is a crime of the third degree to assault a law enforcement officer if the victim is injured; otherwise, it is a crime of the fourth degree.  Under this bill, the penalty for assaulting a law enforcement officer would become a crime of the second degree.  Additionally, the defendant would not be allowed to enter a guilty plea to a lesser charge. The bill provides that a conviction for assaulting a law enforcement officer would not merge with any other criminal offense.  Under the bill, a mandatory term of incarceration under the No Early Release Act (NERA) would not apply to second degree assault of a law enforcement officer, unless the assault resulted in bodily injury or seriously bodily injury. The bill would also upgrade the penalty for assault with bodily fluids of a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or person engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services who suffers bodily injury.  Under current law, it is a crime of the fourth degree for a person to assault a Department of Corrections employee, county correctional police officer, juvenile correctional police officer, State juvenile facility employee, juvenile detention staff member, probation officer, any sheriff, undersheriff or sheriffs officer, or any municipal, county, or State law enforcement officer.  If the victim suffers bodily injury, it is a crime of the third degree.  The bill would add firefighters and persons engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services to the list of officers protected under current law. Under the bill, the penalty for assault with bodily fluids would be upgraded to a crime of the second degree if the victim suffers bodily injury.  Additionally, any person charged with assault with a bodily fluid would be required to provide a blood sample or other biological sample drawn to be tested for communicable diseases at a clinical laboratory licensed by the Department of Health.  Any positive results for a communicable disease will be shared with the assault victim. A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.

(2) Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person drives the vehicle while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) and bodily injury results. (3) Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the second degree if serious bodily injury results from the defendant operating the auto or vessel while in violation of R.S.39:4-50 or section 2 of P.L.1981, c.512 (C.39:4-50.4a) while: (a) on any school property used for school purposes which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board, or within 1,000 feet of such school property; (b) driving through a school crossing as defined in R.S.39:1-1 if the municipality, by ordinance or resolution, has designated the school crossing as such; or (c) driving through a school crossing as defined in R.S.39:1-1 knowing that juveniles are present if the municipality has not designated the school crossing as such by ordinance or resolution. Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if bodily injury results from the defendant operating the auto or vessel in violation of this paragraph. A map or true copy of a map depicting the location and boundaries of the area on or within 1,000 feet of any property used for school purposes which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or school board produced pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1987, c.101 (C.2C:35-7) may be used in a prosecution under subparagraph (a) of paragraph (3) of this subsection. It shall be no defense to a prosecution for a violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that the defendant was unaware that the prohibited conduct took place while on or within 1,000 feet of any school property or while driving through a school crossing.  Nor shall it be a defense to a prosecution under subparagraph (a) or (b) of paragraph (3) of this subsection that no juveniles were present on the school property or crossing zone at the time of the offense or that the school was not in session. (4) Assault by auto or vessel is a crime of the third degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and serious bodily injury results and is a crime of the fourth degree if the person purposely drives a vehicle in an aggressive manner directed at another vehicle and bodily injury results.  For purposes of this paragraph, "driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner" shall include, but is not limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of the vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, or following another vehicle too closely.

It shall not be a defense that the defendant did not know that the child was present or reasonably believed that the child was 16 years of age or older. The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to create any liability on the part of a participant in a youth sports event or to abrogate any immunity or defense available to a participant in a youth sports event.  As used in this act, "school or community sponsored youth sports event" means a competition, practice, or instructional event involving one or more interscholastic sports teams or youth sports teams organized pursuant to a nonprofit or similar charter or which are member teams in a youth league organized by or affiliated with a county or municipal recreation department and shall not include collegiate, semi-professional or professional sporting events. (cf: P.L.2021, c.352, s.1) 2.   Section 2 of P.L.1997, c. 182 (C.2C:12-13) is amended to read as follows: 2.   A person who throws a bodily fluid at a Department of Corrections employee, county correctional police officer, juvenile correctional police officer, State juvenile facility employee, juvenile detention staff member, probation officer, any sheriff, undersheriff or sheriff's officer [or], any municipal, county, or State law enforcement officer, a paid or volunteer firefighter, or a person engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services while in the performance of the person's duties or otherwise purposely subjects such employee or volunteer to contact with a bodily fluid commits an aggravated assault.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to preclude, if the evidence so warrants, an indictment and conviction for a violation or attempted violation of chapter 11 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes or subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:12-1 or any other provision of the criminal laws. (cf: P.L.2019, c.219, s.4) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill upgrades certain penalties for assaulting a law enforcement officer.  The bill also increases the penalty for assault with bodily fluids if the victim is a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or person engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services and suffers bodily injury. Under current law, it is a crime of the third degree to assault a law enforcement officer if the victim is injured; otherwise, it is a crime of the fourth degree.  Under this bill, the penalty for assaulting a law enforcement officer would become a crime of the second degree.  Additionally, the defendant would not be allowed to enter a guilty plea to a lesser charge. The bill provides that a conviction for assaulting a law enforcement officer would not merge with any other criminal offense.  Under the bill, a mandatory term of incarceration under the No Early Release Act (NERA) would not apply to second degree assault of a law enforcement officer, unless the assault resulted in bodily injury or seriously bodily injury. The bill would also upgrade the penalty for assault with bodily fluids of a law enforcement officer, paid or volunteer firefighter, or person engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services who suffers bodily injury.  Under current law, it is a crime of the fourth degree for a person to assault a Department of Corrections employee, county correctional police officer, juvenile correctional police officer, State juvenile facility employee, juvenile detention staff member, probation officer, any sheriff, undersheriff or sheriffs officer, or any municipal, county, or State law enforcement officer.  If the victim suffers bodily injury, it is a crime of the third degree.  The bill would add firefighters and persons engaged in emergency first-aid or medical services to the list of officers protected under current law. Under the bill, the penalty for assault with bodily fluids would be upgraded to a crime of the second degree if the victim suffers bodily injury.  Additionally, any person charged with assault with a bodily fluid would be required to provide a blood sample or other biological sample drawn to be tested for communicable diseases at a clinical laboratory licensed by the Department of Health.  Any positive results for a communicable disease will be shared with the assault victim. A crime of the second degree is punishable by five to 10 years imprisonment, a fine of up to $150,000, or both.
