A taxpayer that is a New Jersey S corporation shall not be allowed the credit directly, but the amount of credit of a taxpayer in respect of a pro rata share of S corporation income shall be determined by allocating to the taxpayer that proportion of the credit acquired by the New Jersey S corporation that is equal to the taxpayers share, whether or not distributed, of the total pro-rata share of S corporation income of the New Jersey S corporation for its privilege period ending within or with the taxpayers taxable year. e.     A taxpayer shall not be allowed a credit pursuant to this section and pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2005, c.318 (C.54A:4-11) for the same employee in the same taxable year. 3.    Notwithstanding any provision of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Taxation is authorized to adopt immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law such rules and regulations as are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this act, which shall be effective for a period not to exceed 18 months following the date of filing and may thereafter be amended, adopted, or readopted by the director in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 4.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years and privilege periods beginning on or after January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill allows taxpayers to claim a credit against their corporation business tax liability or gross income tax liability in the amount of 10 percent of salary and wages paid to an employee with a developmental disability. The credit is capped at $3,000 per employee, and the total credit is capped at $60,000 per taxpayer per year. The bill defines employee with a developmental disability as an employee of the taxpayer who has a developmental disability as defined in N.J.S.A.30:6D-25 and for who the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Department of Human Services has declared eligible for its services. New Jersey already allows taxpayers to claim a credit for the employment of certain persons with disabilities at an occupational training center or sheltered workshop. This bill allows a credit for any type of employment, but taxpayers will be prohibited from claiming the credit allowed by this bill if in the same year they claim a credit for employment of the same employee at an occupational training center or sheltered workshop.
