<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section) Any employer
who takes a retaliatory action against an employee by discharging or in any
other manner discriminating against the employee because the employee has made
a complaint to that employer, the commissioner, or an authorized representative
of the employee, that the employer has violated the provisions of the child
labor law, P.L.1940, c.153 (C.34:2-21.1 et seq.), or because the employee has
caused to be instituted or is about to cause to be instituted any proceeding
under, or related to, that law, or because that employee has testified or is
about to testify in any proceeding under, or related to, that law, or because
the employee has informed any employee of the employer about rights under that law
or other State law regarding wages and hours worked or other conditions of
employment, shall be guilty of a disorderly persons offense and, upon
conviction for a first violation, shall be punished by a fine of not less than
$500 nor more than $1,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than
90 days or by both the fine and imprisonment and, upon conviction for a second
or subsequent violation, be punished by a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more
than $2,000 or by imprisonment for not less than 10 nor more than 100 days or
by both the fine and imprisonment.  Each week, in any day of which any
violation of the provisions of this section continues, shall constitute a
separate and distinct offense.  In the case of a discharge or other
discriminatory action against the employee which is in violation of this
section, the employer shall also be required to offer reinstatement in
employment to the discharged employee and to correct the discriminatory action,
and also to pay to the employee, in full, all wages lost as a result of that
discharge or discriminatory action, plus liquidated damages equal to not more
than 200 percent of the wages due, under penalty of contempt proceedings. 
Taking an adverse action against an employee within 90 days of the employee
filing a complaint with the commissioner or a claim or action being brought by
or on behalf of the employee in a court of competent jurisdiction for a
violation of the child labor law shall be considered presumptive evidence that
the employer's action was knowingly taken in retaliation against the employee.

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The purpose of this bill is to
protect the welfare of working minors by helping to implement the goal of the
child labor law of preventing excessive or hazardous work from interfering with
their educational success, health, or general well-being.  The bill strengthens
the enforcement of the States child labor law by providing:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    An increase in the
minimum fines for a knowing violation of the law to $500 for an initial
violation and $1,000 for each subsequent violation, the same as the minimum
fines currently imposed for knowing violations of the wage payment, minimum
wage, and prevailing wage laws.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    That it is a third
degree crime, with minimum fines of $1,000 for an initial violation and $2,000
for subsequent violations, for an employer to employ a minor not registered and
authorized to work, to employ a minor during days or weeks in which school is
in session at times or for an amount of time not allowed by the child labor
law, or to employ a minor in hazardous work with equipment or in occupations or
workplaces prohibited by that law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    That an employer is
guilty of a second degree crime, with a minimum fine of $4,000, if a child,
while employed by the employer in violation of the child labor law, suffers any
injury, occupational disease, or death which is currently compensable at twice
the regular rate under the workers compensation law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    That an employer who is
convicted of a crime of the third or second degree under the bill will have its
registration and authorization to employ minors suspended for not less than one
year if convicted of a third degree crime, and not less than two years if
convicted of a second degree crime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    That an employer who
applies for registration and authorization to employ minors after the effective
date of the bill is required to acknowledge receipt of a written statement from
the Department of Labor and Workforce Development of the requirements of the
child labor law and provide a written affirmation that the employer understands
and agrees to comply with those requirements before being registered and
authorized to employ minors.  An employer who was already registered as of the
effective date of the bill is required to provide the acknowledgement and
affirmation not more than 10 business days after receiving the statement from
the department, or have the registration revoked until the employer provides
the acknowledgement and affirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    That an employer who
employs minors without obtaining the required registration, or who employs
minors during the period in which the employers registration is suspended or
revoked, will be barred from employing minors for a period of three years in
addition to any other period of debarment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    That an employer who
takes retaliatory actions against an employee for making complaints or
initiating actions regarding violations of the child labor law is guilty of
disorderly persons offense punishable by specified fines and penalties, and
required to pay lost wages and liquidated damages of up to 200% of the lost
wages, and offer reinstatement if the employee was discharged in retaliation. 
These remedies are identical to the anti-retaliation provisions of the wage
payment and minimum wage laws. </p>
