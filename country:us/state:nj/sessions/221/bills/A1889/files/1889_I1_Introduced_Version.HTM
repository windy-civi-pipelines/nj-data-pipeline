(cf: P.L.2016, c.37, s.2) 2.    Section 3 of P.L.2016, c.37 (C.30:4-8.13) is amended to read as follows: 3. a. [The Department of Corrections, each] Each county correctional facility[, and each private correctional facility] shall make available either a prepaid or collect call system, or a combination thereof, for telephone services for inmates. b.    Under a prepaid system, funds may be deposited into an inmate account in order to pay for telephone calls, provided that nothing in this section shall require the [department,] county[, or private correctional facility] to provide or administer a prepaid system. c.     The provider of the inmate telephone service, as an additional means of payment, shall permit the recipient of inmate collect calls to establish an account with that provider in order to deposit funds for advance payment of those collect calls. d.    For the purposes of this section, a "collect call system" means a call system pursuant to which recipients are billed for the cost of an accepted telephone call initiated by an inmate.

However, the Commissioner of Corrections may take such anticipating administrative action as necessary for the timely implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill requires the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections and the appropriate person on behalf of a private correctional facility to allow inmates incarcerated in State and private correctional facilities to make telephone and video calls with no charge imposed upon the inmate or the other party. Under current law, certain requirements are imposed upon telephone service contracts for inmates in State, county, and private correctional facilities, including the requirement that the rate for inmate telephone calls is not to exceed 11 cents per minute for domestic debit, prepaid, and collect calls. Under the provisions of this bill, inmates incarcerated in State and private correctional facilities would be permitted to make telephone or video calls with no charge imposed upon the inmate or the other party, including international calls; provided that the telephone service contracts that the facilities enter into still adhere to the State contracting and procurement laws. In the sponsors view, the more incarcerated people stay in touch with their families, the better they do when they reenter society while those with weaker support systems due to lack of communication during incarceration, are more likely to re-offend. Some studies indicate that frequent and consistent family phone calls reduce recidivism and promote rehabilitation after release. The sponsor notes that some families go into debt in their attempt to maintain contact with incarcerated loved ones through phone calls and visitations. It is the sponsors intent to reduce the enormous financial burden of inmate phone calls as the high cost of prison phone calls have sapped savings from low-income families trying to communicate with their loved ones.
