The bill or resolution shall not be recommitted except pursuant to Rule 10:18 or by the vote of 41 or more members. 3.   Rule 2:10 is added as follows: 2:10.    (New) Special Order Speeches. Four times a year, the Speaker, by special order, shall open the floor to special order speeches by members after the General Assembly has concluded its voting, but while the voting board remains open for routine business. The majority and minority parties shall each have up to one hour for special order speeches.  The Speaker shall determine the order of the speeches.  No speech shall exceed 15 minutes.  The Speaker shall reasonably accommodate independent members wishing to make a special order speech. Special order speeches shall be broadcast via Internet on the website of the New Jersey Legislature.  Technical difficulties with the broadcast shall not unreasonably delay or cause the cancellation of special order speeches. 4.   Rule 10:26 is added as follows: 10:26.  (New) Committee Public Comments. Two times a year, each standing reference committee shall schedule at least two hours for public comments on any matters within the subject matter jurisdiction of the committee.  The committee chair, vice-chair or acting chair may set reasonable requirements for these comments, and determine all questions that arise in the course of the comments, including ruling members of the public out of order.  A member of the public ruled out of order shall forfeit any remaining time for comments.  Comments shall be confined to subjects within the jurisdiction of the committee and shall avoid personalities. Public comments may address particular bills or resolutions referred to the committee.  No member of the public shall speak longer than five minutes and shall promptly conclude remarks upon being advised that time is expired. The public comments shall be broadcast via Internet on the website of the New Jersey Legislature.  Technical difficulties with the broadcast shall not unreasonably delay or cause the cancellation of public comments. 5.   This resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Section 1 amends Rule 4:7 and requires the Speaker to include on the Calendar of Bills and Resolutions any bill or resolution with 41 or more sponsors no later than the second meeting of the General Assembly, at which bills and resolutions are considered, after the bill or resolution receives second reading or adds its 41st sponsor, whichever is later.  This provision applies only to bills or resolutions with 41 or more current sponsors. Section 2 adds subsection f. to Rule 10:23. Subsection f. would require that when a bill or resolution has 41 or more sponsors and is referred to a committee, if the committee does not report the bill by the third meeting of that committee after referral, a prime sponsor may so advise the Speaker in writing.  The Speaker shall verify that advice and not later than the next meeting of the General Assembly, when a quorum is present, order the bill or resolution to second reading.  Because the purpose of subsection f. is to expedite the consideration of bills and resolutions with 41 or more sponsors, the bill or resolution may only receive a second or subsequent committee reference under Rule 10:18 or by the vote of 41 or more members. Section 3 adds a new Rule 2:10 on special order speeches.  Special order speeches would be scheduled four times a year and take place after the General Assembly has concluded its voting and while the voting board remains open for routine business.  The majority and minority parties would each have up to one hour for special order speeches.  Each member speaking would have up to 15 minutes.  The Speaker shall reasonably accommodate special order speeches by independent members.  As the General Assembly remains in session during these speeches, they are subject to all rules of the General Assembly and also the speech or debate provisions of Article IV, Section IV, paragraph 9 of the New Jersey Constitution. Section 4 adds a new Rule 10:26 regarding comments by members of the public before standing reference committees.  Two times a year, each standing reference committee must schedule two hours for public comments.  The committee member presiding during these comments shall resolve all issues that arise and ensure that proper decorum is followed at all times.  Public comments shall not deal with personalities and must be confined to subjects within the jurisdiction of the committee.
