In addition to all fees otherwise required by law for the registration of a motor vehicle, the bill imposes an application fee of $50 and an annual renewal fee of $10 for the alumni license plates.  After the deduction of the cost of designing, producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the plates and of any computer programming changes that are necessary to implement each alumni license plate program, any additional fee collections are required to be deposited into the special non-lapsing fund established for each four-year public institution of higher education.  The proceeds of each fund are to be annually appropriated to an alumni association of the applicable four-year public institution of higher education to support the organizations mission and programs. The chief administrator is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, renewing, and publicizing the availability of the alumni license plates for each alumni license plate program.  If the average cost per plate exceeds $50 in two consecutive fiscal years, the chief administrator may discontinue an alumni license plate program.  The bill also requires the director of an alumni association to appoint a liaison to represent the alumni association in all communications with the commission regarding the alumni license plates. The bill prohibits the use of State or other public funds by the commission to cover the initial cost to implement an alumni license plate program.  The bill requires an alumni association or an individual or entity designated by an alumni association to contribute non-public monies, not to exceed $25,000, to offset the initial costs to design, produce, issue, and publicize the license plates and for computer programming changes which may be necessary to implement the program.  The bill authorizes an alumni association of a four-year public institution of higher education to receive funds from private sources to offset the initial costs. Under the bill, the commission is not required to design, produce, issue, or publicize the availability of alumni license plates or make any necessary programming changes, until: (1) an alumni association or the individual or entity designated by an alumni association has provided the commission with the money necessary to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission in establishing the license plate program; and (2) the liaison of an alumni association has provided the commission with a minimum of 500 completed applications for the license plates.
