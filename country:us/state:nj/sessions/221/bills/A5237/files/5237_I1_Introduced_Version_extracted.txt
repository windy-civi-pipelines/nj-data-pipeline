(2)   the Attorney General, ex officio, or a designee; (3)   the former chairperson of the Anti-Bullying Task Force appointed pursuant to P.L.2019, c.179; (4)   four public members appointed by the President of the Senate and four public members appointed by the Speaker of the General Assembly, all of whom shall have demonstrated expertise in issues relating to the work of the commission;
