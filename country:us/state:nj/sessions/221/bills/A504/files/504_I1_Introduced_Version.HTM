supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes, and amending various parts of
the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Vegetation Management Response Act. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  a.  The
Legislature finds and declares that: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Unprecedented damage was
inflicted on the State and its citizens by Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane Irene,
the June 2012 Derecho, and the October 2011 snow storm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Estimated damage from
these storms includes approximately 11,400 downed or damaged utility poles,
155,000 downed trees, 60 flooded substations, and six million customer outages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   Superstorm Sandy alone
led to the loss of approximately 116 overhead electric transmission lines and
117,000 trees and damage to over 71 percent of all electric distribution
circuits and approximately 5,000 overhead and pad mounted electric transformers. 
The destruction caused by Superstorm Sandy required assistance from more than
20,000 out-of-State electric public utility workers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   The March 2018
noreasters left hundreds of thousands of New Jersey residents and businesses
without power and, as a result, the Board of Public Utilities ordered the
States four electric public utilities to undertake additional efforts to
better prepare electric public utilities for any major weather event in the
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The Legislature
therefore determines that it is necessary to authorize electric public
utilities to maintain, remove, and replace dangerous vegetation to prevent
power disruptions and preserve the uninterrupted transmission and distribution
of power in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section) As used in
section 1 through 4 and section 10 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending
before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     ANSI means the American
National Standards Institute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Board means the Board of
Public Utilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Dangerous vegetation means a
tree, shrub, plant, or any other vegetation growing in, near, or adjacent to
the electric public utilitys right of way, and the electric distribution and
transmission system, but not including a service line to an individual
customer, which may electric distribution line, as determined by the electric</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>public utility or local government
entity having control of the right of way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>      Distribution line means a
wire, line, pole, and other structure and facility which carries electricity
from an electric public utility substation to customers, but not including a
service line to an individual customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Electric public utility or
utility means a public utility, as that term is defined in R.S.48:2-13, that
is under the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities, is investor-owned,
and transmits and distributes electricity to end users within this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Transmission line means a
line or cable, including the supporting structures and appurtenant facilities,
which carries electricity from a generating plant to an electric substation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Vegetation management means
the clearing, moving, cutting, or destroying to remove, replace as reasonable
and necessary, or maintain dangerous vegetation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section)  a. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of the New Jersey Shade Tree and Community
Forestry Assistance Act, P.L.1996, c.135 (C.13:1L-17.1 et al.) or any other
provision of law, rule, regulation, or order to the contrary, to ensure the
continued reliable supply of electricity in this State, an electric public
utility is authorized to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   utilize all reasonably
available methods according to ANSI A300 tree care standards and pursuant to
board rules and regulations, which may include, but not be limited to,
clearing, moving, cutting, or destroying to remove, replace as reasonable and
necessary, or maintain dangerous vegetation; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) establish, upon receipt of
board approval, a program to develop effective strategies to implement the
provisions of this section, as appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    An electric public
utility shall make a diligent attempt to notify all customers, property owners,
and local and other government entities that may be affected by planned
vegetation management activity along the utility's distribution or transmission
system.  This requirement shall be satisfied if the utility provides written
notice to customers and property owners pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of
this subsection, at least seven days, but not more than 45 days, prior to
performing any vegetation management activity, and provides notice to local and
other government entities pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   For a distribution line,
the electric public utility shall provide notice to the following customers and
property owners by separate direct mailing, door hanger, or any other method
approved by the board:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)   a customer of the
utility upon whose property runs any portion of the right-of-way or easement
that will be maintained by the utility; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   a property owner where
there is no customer of the utility located on the property and the property
includes a portion of the right-of-way or easement that will be maintained by
the utility.</p>
