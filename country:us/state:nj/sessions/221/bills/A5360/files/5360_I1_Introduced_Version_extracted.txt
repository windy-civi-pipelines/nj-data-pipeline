The board is required to review the medical baseline as necessary, but not less than every third calendar year, to ensure its calculation accurately represents the current needs of medical baseline customers in this State and achieves the bills purposes.  The board is to consider certain factors described in the bill when determining or reviewing the medical baseline. A public utility is required to make available an application for residential customers of the public utility to its medical baseline program.  An application for the medical baseline program is to include certain information as described in the bill.
