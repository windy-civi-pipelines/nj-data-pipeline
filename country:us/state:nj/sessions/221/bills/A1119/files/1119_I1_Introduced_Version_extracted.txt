(cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.1) 2.    Section 4 of P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-18) is amended to read as follows: 4.    a.  A resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction from gross income for that portion of the rent constituting property taxes [not in excess of $15,000], subject to the limitations of subsection d. of this section, due and paid for the calendar year in which the rent constituting taxes is due and payable, for occupancy of that homestead. b.    A husband and wife who elect to file separate income tax returns pursuant to the "New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act," N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., shall each be entitled to one-half of the property tax deduction allowed pursuant to this section. c.     If more than one taxpayer, other than husband and wife, qualify to deduct rent constituting property taxes by reason of their having occupied the same rented homestead, it shall be presumed that the deduction shall be equally divided.  A taxpayer may, however, deduct an amount for rent constituting property taxes in the same proportion that the rent paid by that taxpayer bears to the total rent paid by all tenants of the same unit. d.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1) a resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1996 based on 50% of the rent constituting property taxes not in excess of $5,000 paid for the occupancy of that homestead; and (2) a resident taxpayer whose homestead is a unit of residential rental property shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1997 based on 75% of the rent constituting property taxes not in excess of $7,500 paid for the occupancy of that homestead. (cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.2) 3.    Section 5 of P.L.1996, c.60 (C.54A:3A-19) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.  If a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, the taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction, [not in excess of $15,000,] subject to the limitations of subsection b. of this section, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property tax credit as defined in section 1 of P.L.2018, c.11 (C.54:4-66.6) plus the amount of property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the property taxes are due and payable on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes due and paid for the calendar year in which the rent constituting property taxes is due and payable for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property, provided however, that the amount of property taxes and property tax credits shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. through e. of section 3 and the amount of rent constituting property taxes shall be subject to the limitations set forth in subsections b. and c. of section 4 as may be applicable. b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection a. of this section to the contrary: (1) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1996 based on 50% of an amount not in excess of $5,000, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property; and (2) a taxpayer who is eligible for a deduction for property taxes under section 3 of this act for a part of the taxable year and is also eligible for a deduction for rent constituting property taxes under section 4 of this act for a part of the taxable year, shall be allowed a deduction for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning during 1997 based on 75% of an amount not in excess of $7,500, the amount of which shall be equal to the sum of the amount of property taxes paid on a homestead that is not a unit of residential rental property and the amount of rent constituting property taxes paid for the occupancy of a homestead that is a unit of residential rental property. (cf: P.L.2018, c.45, s.3) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately and apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2022. STATEMENT This bill permits taxpayers to deduct the total amount of State property taxes, due and paid in a calendar year on the taxpayers principal residence, from the taxpayers gross income tax obligation. Under current law, a taxpayer may deduct up to $15,000 of property taxes due and paid in the calendar year on the taxpayers primary residence from the taxpayers gross income tax obligation.  If the taxpayer is a renter, the taxpayer may deduct up to $15,000 of the amount of rent constituting property tax, which is defined in P.L.1996, c.60, s.2 (C.54A:3A-16) to mean 18 percent of rent, due and paid in the calendar year from the taxpayers gross income tax obligation.  This bill eliminates these $15,000 maximum allowable deductions, thereby permitting a taxpayer to deduct the full amount of property taxes, or rent constituting property taxes, due and paid by the taxpayer in the calendar year on the taxpayers primary residence.
