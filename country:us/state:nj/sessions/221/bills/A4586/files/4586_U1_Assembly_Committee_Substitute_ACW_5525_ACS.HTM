HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Carter, Speight, Tucker, Morales, Assemblymen Spearman and Miller SYNOPSIS Establishes Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Substitute as adopted by the Assembly Community Development and Women's Affairs Committee. An Act establishing the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act; amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.) (Set-Aside Act), requiring that 15 percent of contracts be awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses, and three percent to women-owned businesses. b.  In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989), that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for minority businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it did not meet the Courts strict scrutiny standard. c.  Following the Croson decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race and gender discrimination in State procurement. d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination in Public Works Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the commission to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence of any prior to present discrimination. e.  The commission released the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which the State passively participated. f.  Governor Florio issued Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act, requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein they would be required to make a good faith effort to award seven percent of public procurement and construction contracts to minority-owned businesses and three percent to women-owned businesses. g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court in the matter of GEOD v. State of New Jersey, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC) (D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses and instead instituting a race-neutral and gender-neutral small business set-aside program. h.  In 2005, the State released an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development, tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-neutral and gender-neutral means. i.  On January 23, 2024, the State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020. j.  Despite decades of a race-neutral and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting with minority and women-owned business enterprises, including specifically in contracting with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and nonminority women for construction, professional services, and goods and services. k.  The State has a compelling interest in promoting markets free of discrimination, to engage contractors and subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors. l.  It is the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting. m.  In an effort to reduce barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State contracting, State agencies, State contracting units, and prime contractors should be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good faith effort to increase participation by such businesses. n.  The contracting goals set forth in P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity study released in January of 2024 and are narrowly tailored to address the reports findings of significant statistical disparities in the States contract awards. 3.    (New section) As used in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Chief means the Chief Supplier Development Officer of the Office of Supplier Development and Business Opportunities established in the Department of the Treasury, or a successor. Department means the Department of the Treasury. Disparity study means the 2024 State of New Jersey Study on the Availability and Utilization of Small, Minority, Women, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses. Construction contract means a contract for erection, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, custom fabrication, repair work, or maintenance work, including painting and decorating, subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act, done under contract and funded in whole or in part with public funds or on the property or premises owned by the government entity. Electronic database means the database in which the department maintains a listing of certified businesses in the business categories set forth in this act. Goods and services contract means a contract for commodities or services not otherwise defined as professional, architectural, or engineering. Minority means a person as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). Minority business means a business as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). Nonminority means a person who identifies themselves as White, not of Hispanic or Latino origin, and not of any other race. Office means the Office of Supplier Development and Business Opportunities established in the Department of the Treasury, or its successor. Professional services contract means a contract for services performed by a person authorized and regulated by law to practice a recognized profession that requires advanced knowledge in a field of learning acquired by a prolonged formal course of specialized instruction and study, including architects and engineers providing design consultant services related to construction projects.

(3) (a) Each State agency or State contracting unit shall make a good faith effort to attain the goals established pursuant to this section. Each State agency or State contracting unit that substantially fails to make a good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this subsection in such State agencys or State contracting units contracting shall be required to submit to the chief, for approval, a remedial action plan to remedy such failure.  If it is determined by the chief that any State agency or State contracting unit has failed to act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan within one year, the chief shall provide written notice of such a finding, which shall be made publicly available, and shall compel direct implementation of remedial actions, which may include, but shall not be limited to: (i) assuring that sufficient and effective solicitation efforts to minority and women-owned businesses are being made by the State agency or State contracting unit; (ii) dividing contract requirements, when economically feasible, into quantities that will expand the participation of minority and women-owned businesses; (iii) eliminating extended experience or capitalization requirements, when programmatically and economically feasible, to expand participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (iv) other remedial actions determined appropriate by the chief and in accordance with any applicable rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b) Upon a finding by the chief that a State agency or State contracting unit has failed to take affirmative measures to implement the remedial plan and to follow any of the remedial actions set forth by the chief, and in the absence of any objective progress towards the State agencys or State contracting units goals, the chief may require some or all the State agencys or State contracting units procurement, for a specified period of time, be placed under the direction and control of another agency or agencies. (4) A State agencys or State contracting units good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this section shall be evidenced by documentation showing that the State agency or State contracting unit: (a) considered structuring contracts in a manner to allow underutilized bidders to be able to compete for the State agencys or State contracting units contracts; (b) offered periodic opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to learn of the State agencys or State contracting units general anticipated contract needs prior to advertisement, independent of a published bid solicitation, and to learn about the State agencys or State contracting units contracting practices and requirements; (c) conducted periodic outreach to business associations representing minority and women-owned businesses to publicize the State agencys or State contracting units contracting opportunities; (d) used the States central certification registry or a similar dataset to identify and notify all listed minority and women-owned businesses in the relevant market of the opportunity to submit a bid for a contract subject to goals for which the respective businesses qualify; and (e) took other actions determined appropriate by the chief and in accordance with any applicable rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). b.  For purposes of attaining the goals set forth in this section, State agencies and State contracting units may establish bid criteria for contracts or portions of contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority businesses or women-owned businesses, though the State agency or State contracting unit may still award the contract to a bidder that is not a minority business or women-owned business.  The goals established in subsection a. of this section shall not be required to be attained independently and may be attained through contracts awarded to businesses that qualify as minority businesses and women-owned businesses that may count towards more than one goal. c.  In setting and achieving the goals set forth in this section, State agencies and State contracting units shall: (1) consult the findings contained within the disparity study evidencing relevant industry-specific disparities in the utilization of minority and women-owned businesses relative to their availability or, with written notice to the chief, conduct another disparity study and consult the findings therein; (2) implement a program that will enable the State agency or State contracting unit to evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate goal for participation by minority and women-owned businesses; (3) consider, where practicable, the severability of construction projects and other bundled contracts; (4) consider compliance with the requirements of any federal law concerning opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses which effectuate the purposes of this section.  The State agency or State contracting unit shall determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any such law duplicates or conflicts with the provisions hereof and, if such duplication or conflict exists, the State agency or State contracting unit shall waive the applicability of this section to the extent of such duplication or conflict; (5)   submit a report to the chief upon contract completion, which shall indicate the contract goals, the means by which the contractor in its bid initially proposed to meet the goals for subcontracting of the contract or the good faith efforts the contractor undertook to do so, and the contractors performance in continuing to meet the goals for subcontracting during the term of the contract.  The report shall also note any significant issues that arose during the contract that may have resulted in decreased participation as subcontractors by Black-owned businesses, Black male-owned businesses, Black women-owned businesses, Asian American-owned businesses, Asian American male-owned businesses, Asian American women-owned businesses, Hispanic-owned businesses, Hispanic male-owned businesses, Hispanic women-owned businesses, and nonminority women-owned businesses.  The State agency or State contracting unit shall review all reports with the chief to continually refine its contract terms to promote successful implementation of the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and nonminority women-owned businesses, as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting; and (6)   take any other action that the chief determines to be appropriate to effectuate rules adopted by the State Treasurer.  This may include, but shall not be limited to, a provision providing for appropriate relief should any contractor knowingly and willfully fail to comply with the goal requirements of this section. d.  (1) Each prime contractor shall make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals established in this section.  For purposes of determining a contractors good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section, the State agency or State contracting unit shall consider: (a) whether the contractor has promoted the subcontracting opportunity to, or otherwise made minority businesses and nonminority women-owned business aware of the opportunity, in such event, (i) whether minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses exhibited interest in working with the contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency or State contracting unit awarding the contract; and (ii) minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses prior to the State agencys or State contracting units bid submission deadline; (b) whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities on the contract to appropriate minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses that appear in the States electronic database; (c) whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses; and (d) whether other actions determined appropriate by the chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), were taken. (2) Failure on the part of a contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be grounds for the rejection of bids made by that contractor on the contract for which the contractor is required to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section. (3) Contractors shall comply with the goal requirements of this section for the duration of the contract. If the contractor removes, adds, or changes a subcontractor, the contractor is required to comply with the goal requirements of this section to the same as its original bid or demonstrate that good faith efforts were taken to comply with the requirements of this section.  Failure on the part of a contractor to comply or demonstrate a good faith effort during the term of the contract, and any extensions thereto, will result in the State agency or State contracting unit advising the chief of the contractors noncompliance in the report required pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection c. of this section. (4) Upon receiving any such report from a State agency or State contracting unit alleging that a contractor failed to meet the requirements of this section or did not make good faith efforts to comply with those requirements, the chief shall conduct a mandatory plenary review of the contractors efforts to comply with the requirements of this section and shall determine if any action should be taken against the contractor.  The State agency or State contracting unit and the contractor shall comply with the chiefs requests for documents and information to support the plenary review.  Upon completion of the plenary review, if the chief determines that the contractor failed to meet or failed to make a good faith effort to meet the goal requirements of this section, the chief may issue an order taking appropriate action against the contractor, which may include one or more of the following:  (a) order the contractor to complete mandatory training at the contractors own expense prior to bidding on any State contract; (b) bypass the future award of one or more pending contract awards; (c) debar the contractor from State contracting for a period of time of up to five years; and (d) mandate such other relief as the chief deems appropriate. 5.  Section 3 of P.L.1987, c.318 (C.5:10-21.1a) is amended to read as follows: 3.  The [authority] office is authorized and directed to establish, prior to initiating any project on or after the effective date of [this 1987 amendatory and supplementary act] P.L.1987, c.318 (C.5:10-5 et al.), small business [, minority business and women's business] set-aside contract goals and procedures in accordance with the provisions of the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses [, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses], P.L.1983, c. 482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.).

HALL District 28 (Essex and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Carter, Speight, Tucker, Morales, Assemblymen Spearman and Miller SYNOPSIS Establishes Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Substitute as adopted by the Assembly Community Development and Women's Affairs Committee. An Act establishing the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act; amending various parts of the statutory law, and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section) Sections 1 through 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act. 2.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses, P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.) (Set-Aside Act), requiring that 15 percent of contracts be awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses, and three percent to women-owned businesses. b.  In 1989, the United States Supreme Court held in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989), that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for minority businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it did not meet the Courts strict scrutiny standard. c.  Following the Croson decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race and gender discrimination in State procurement. d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination in Public Works Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the commission to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence of any prior to present discrimination. e.  The commission released the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which the State passively participated. f.  Governor Florio issued Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act, requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein they would be required to make a good faith effort to award seven percent of public procurement and construction contracts to minority-owned businesses and three percent to women-owned businesses. g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court in the matter of GEOD v. State of New Jersey, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC) (D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses and instead instituting a race-neutral and gender-neutral small business set-aside program. h.  In 2005, the State released an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development, tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-neutral and gender-neutral means. i.  On January 23, 2024, the State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020. j.  Despite decades of a race-neutral and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting with minority and women-owned business enterprises, including specifically in contracting with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and nonminority women for construction, professional services, and goods and services. k.  The State has a compelling interest in promoting markets free of discrimination, to engage contractors and subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors. l.  It is the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting. m.  In an effort to reduce barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State contracting, State agencies, State contracting units, and prime contractors should be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good faith effort to increase participation by such businesses. n.  The contracting goals set forth in P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity study released in January of 2024 and are narrowly tailored to address the reports findings of significant statistical disparities in the States contract awards. 3.    (New section) As used in this act, P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Chief means the Chief Supplier Development Officer of the Office of Supplier Development and Business Opportunities established in the Department of the Treasury, or a successor. Department means the Department of the Treasury. Disparity study means the 2024 State of New Jersey Study on the Availability and Utilization of Small, Minority, Women, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses. Construction contract means a contract for erection, reconstruction, demolition, alteration, custom fabrication, repair work, or maintenance work, including painting and decorating, subject to the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act, done under contract and funded in whole or in part with public funds or on the property or premises owned by the government entity. Electronic database means the database in which the department maintains a listing of certified businesses in the business categories set forth in this act. Goods and services contract means a contract for commodities or services not otherwise defined as professional, architectural, or engineering. Minority means a person as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). Minority business means a business as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). Nonminority means a person who identifies themselves as White, not of Hispanic or Latino origin, and not of any other race. Office means the Office of Supplier Development and Business Opportunities established in the Department of the Treasury, or its successor. Professional services contract means a contract for services performed by a person authorized and regulated by law to practice a recognized profession that requires advanced knowledge in a field of learning acquired by a prolonged formal course of specialized instruction and study, including architects and engineers providing design consultant services related to construction projects. Professional services are rendered in: the provision of goods, original and creative in a recognized field of artistic endeavor, and extraordinary, non-specifiable services if, after evaluation and assessment, it is determined cannot reasonably be described by written specifications. State agency means any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission, or other instrumentality within or created by such department, and any independent State authority, commission, instrumentality, or agency which is authorized by State law to award contracts. State contracting unit means a government entity that contracts for the procurement of goods, services, professional services, or the construction of public works, either pursuant to chapter 32, 33, or 34 of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes, the State College Contracts Law, P.L.1986, c.43 (C.18A:64-52 et seq.), P.L.2007, c.137 (C.52:18A-235 et seq.), or any other applicable law. Woman or women means a female or females as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). Womens business means a business as defined in section 2 of P.L.1986, c.195 (C.52:27H-21.18). 4.    (New section) a. (1) All State agencies and State contracting units shall establish programs consistent with P.L.    , c.    (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) to facilitate the participation of minority businesses, including Black-owned businesses, Asian American-owned businesses, Hispanic-owned businesses, and nonminority women-owned businesses.  All State agencies and State contracting units shall develop a plan for the fiscal year next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and for each fiscal year thereafter to encourage Black-owned businesses, Asian American-owned businesses, Hispanic-owned businesses, and nonminority women-owned businesses to submit proposals for, and be awarded, contracts in accordance with P.L.    , c.    (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant thereto.  Annually, within 180 calendar days of the end of each State fiscal year, State agencies and State contracting units shall file with the office a report containing information requested by the chief.  The office shall receive and analyze the State agency and State contracting unit reports and provide feedback to the submitting State agencies and State contracting units, as it deems necessary.

(b) State agencies and State contracting units shall implement appropriate adjustments determined by subsequent statistical analyses of the disparities between the availability of and the utilization of contracts held by minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses, and additions or adjustments to the goals set forth in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph to implement remedial measures consistent with prevailing law, as appropriate, and encourage the elimination of disparities between the award of contracts to minority and nonminority women-owned businesses and the availability of minority and nonminority women-owned businesses to perform such contracts. (3) (a) Each State agency or State contracting unit shall make a good faith effort to attain the goals established pursuant to this section. Each State agency or State contracting unit that substantially fails to make a good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this subsection in such State agencys or State contracting units contracting shall be required to submit to the chief, for approval, a remedial action plan to remedy such failure.  If it is determined by the chief that any State agency or State contracting unit has failed to act in good faith to implement the remedial action plan within one year, the chief shall provide written notice of such a finding, which shall be made publicly available, and shall compel direct implementation of remedial actions, which may include, but shall not be limited to: (i) assuring that sufficient and effective solicitation efforts to minority and women-owned businesses are being made by the State agency or State contracting unit; (ii) dividing contract requirements, when economically feasible, into quantities that will expand the participation of minority and women-owned businesses; (iii) eliminating extended experience or capitalization requirements, when programmatically and economically feasible, to expand participation by minority and women-owned businesses; and (iv) other remedial actions determined appropriate by the chief and in accordance with any applicable rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). (b) Upon a finding by the chief that a State agency or State contracting unit has failed to take affirmative measures to implement the remedial plan and to follow any of the remedial actions set forth by the chief, and in the absence of any objective progress towards the State agencys or State contracting units goals, the chief may require some or all the State agencys or State contracting units procurement, for a specified period of time, be placed under the direction and control of another agency or agencies. (4) A State agencys or State contracting units good faith effort to achieve the goals set forth in this section shall be evidenced by documentation showing that the State agency or State contracting unit: (a) considered structuring contracts in a manner to allow underutilized bidders to be able to compete for the State agencys or State contracting units contracts; (b) offered periodic opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses to learn of the State agencys or State contracting units general anticipated contract needs prior to advertisement, independent of a published bid solicitation, and to learn about the State agencys or State contracting units contracting practices and requirements; (c) conducted periodic outreach to business associations representing minority and women-owned businesses to publicize the State agencys or State contracting units contracting opportunities; (d) used the States central certification registry or a similar dataset to identify and notify all listed minority and women-owned businesses in the relevant market of the opportunity to submit a bid for a contract subject to goals for which the respective businesses qualify; and (e) took other actions determined appropriate by the chief and in accordance with any applicable rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). b.  For purposes of attaining the goals set forth in this section, State agencies and State contracting units may establish bid criteria for contracts or portions of contracts that result in a preference being afforded to minority businesses or women-owned businesses, though the State agency or State contracting unit may still award the contract to a bidder that is not a minority business or women-owned business.  The goals established in subsection a. of this section shall not be required to be attained independently and may be attained through contracts awarded to businesses that qualify as minority businesses and women-owned businesses that may count towards more than one goal. c.  In setting and achieving the goals set forth in this section, State agencies and State contracting units shall: (1) consult the findings contained within the disparity study evidencing relevant industry-specific disparities in the utilization of minority and women-owned businesses relative to their availability or, with written notice to the chief, conduct another disparity study and consult the findings therein; (2) implement a program that will enable the State agency or State contracting unit to evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate goal for participation by minority and women-owned businesses; (3) consider, where practicable, the severability of construction projects and other bundled contracts; (4) consider compliance with the requirements of any federal law concerning opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses which effectuate the purposes of this section.  The State agency or State contracting unit shall determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any such law duplicates or conflicts with the provisions hereof and, if such duplication or conflict exists, the State agency or State contracting unit shall waive the applicability of this section to the extent of such duplication or conflict; (5)   submit a report to the chief upon contract completion, which shall indicate the contract goals, the means by which the contractor in its bid initially proposed to meet the goals for subcontracting of the contract or the good faith efforts the contractor undertook to do so, and the contractors performance in continuing to meet the goals for subcontracting during the term of the contract.  The report shall also note any significant issues that arose during the contract that may have resulted in decreased participation as subcontractors by Black-owned businesses, Black male-owned businesses, Black women-owned businesses, Asian American-owned businesses, Asian American male-owned businesses, Asian American women-owned businesses, Hispanic-owned businesses, Hispanic male-owned businesses, Hispanic women-owned businesses, and nonminority women-owned businesses.  The State agency or State contracting unit shall review all reports with the chief to continually refine its contract terms to promote successful implementation of the policy of the State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and nonminority women-owned businesses, as well as small businesses in all areas of State contracting; and (6)   take any other action that the chief determines to be appropriate to effectuate rules adopted by the State Treasurer.  This may include, but shall not be limited to, a provision providing for appropriate relief should any contractor knowingly and willfully fail to comply with the goal requirements of this section. d.  (1) Each prime contractor shall make a good faith effort to attain the subcontractor goals established in this section.  For purposes of determining a contractors good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section, the State agency or State contracting unit shall consider: (a) whether the contractor has promoted the subcontracting opportunity to, or otherwise made minority businesses and nonminority women-owned business aware of the opportunity, in such event, (i) whether minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses exhibited interest in working with the contractor on a particular project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any, scheduled by the State agency or State contracting unit awarding the contract; and (ii) minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses, which have been solicited by the contractor, have responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses prior to the State agencys or State contracting units bid submission deadline; (b) whether the contractor provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities on the contract to appropriate minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses that appear in the States electronic database; (c) whether the contractor can reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to increase the likelihood of participation by minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses; and (d) whether other actions determined appropriate by the chief through rules adopted by the State Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), were taken. (2) Failure on the part of a contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be grounds for the rejection of bids made by that contractor on the contract for which the contractor is required to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting requirements of this section.
