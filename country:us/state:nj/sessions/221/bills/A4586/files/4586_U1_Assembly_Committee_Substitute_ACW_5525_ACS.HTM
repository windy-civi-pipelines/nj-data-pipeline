small-caps'>Be It Enacted</span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:
150%'> </span><i>by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned
Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed
the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses,
P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.) (Set-Aside Act), requiring that 15 percent
of contracts be awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses,
and three percent to women-owned businesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  In 1989, the United States
Supreme Court held in <u>City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co.</u>, 488 U.S. 469 (1989),
that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for minority businesses
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it did not meet
the Courts strict scrutiny standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Following the <u>Croson</u>
decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State
had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race
and gender discrimination in State procurement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean
issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination
in Public Works Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the commission
to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and
prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence
of any prior to present discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The commission released
the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings
showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of
minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and
anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which
the State passively participated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Governor Florio issued
Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act,
requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein
they would be required to make a good faith effort to award seven percent of
public procurement and construction contracts to minority-owned businesses and
three percent to women-owned businesses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act
was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court
in the matter of <u>GEOD v. State of New Jersey</u>, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC)
(D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive
Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses
and instead instituting a race-neutral and gender-neutral small business set-aside
program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  In 2005, the State released
an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order
No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development,
tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based
on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies
and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-neutral and gender-neutral
means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  On January 23, 2024, the
State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting
opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  Despite decades of a race-neutral
and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial
measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting
with minority and women-owned business enterprises, including specifically in contracting
with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans,
and nonminority women for construction, professional services, and goods and services.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  The State has a compelling
interest in promoting markets free of discrimination, to engage contractors and
subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote
contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available
and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  It is the policy of the
State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free
from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation
of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas
of State contracting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.  In an effort to reduce
barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State
contracting, State agencies, State contracting units, and prime contractors should
be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good faith effort to increase
participation by such businesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.  The contracting goals set
forth in P.L.    , c.   (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill) are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity
study released in January of 2024 and are narrowly tailored to address the
reports findings of significant statistical disparities in the States
contract awards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    (New section) As used in

the goals set forth in this section, State agencies and State contracting units
may establish bid criteria for contracts or portions of contracts that result
in a preference being afforded to minority businesses or women-owned
businesses, though the State agency or State contracting unit may still award
the contract to a bidder that is not a minority business or women-owned
business.  The goals established in subsection a. of this section shall not be
required to be attained independently and may be attained through contracts
awarded to businesses that qualify as minority businesses and women-owned
businesses that may count towards more than one goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  In setting and achieving
the goals set forth in this section, <span style='color:black'>State </span>agencies
and State contracting units shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) consult the findings
contained within the disparity study evidencing relevant industry-specific
disparities in the utilization of minority and women-owned businesses relative
to their availability or, with written notice to the chief, conduct another
disparity study and consult the findings therein;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) implement a program that
will enable the <span style='color:black'>State </span>agency or State
contracting unit to evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate goal
for participation by minority and women-owned businesses;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) consider, where
practicable, the severability of construction projects and other bundled
contracts; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) consider compliance with
the requirements of any federal law concerning opportunities for minority and
women-owned businesses which effectuate the purposes of this section.  The <span
style='color:black'>State </span>agency or State contracting unit shall
determine whether the imposition of the requirements of any such law duplicates
or conflicts with the provisions hereof and, if such duplication or conflict
exists, the <span style='color:black'>State </span>agency or State contracting
unit shall waive the applicability of this section to the extent of such
duplication or conflict; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   submit a report to the chief
upon contract completion, which shall indicate the contract goals, the means by
which the contractor in its bid initially proposed to meet the goals for
subcontracting of the contract or the good faith efforts the contractor
undertook to do so, and the contractors performance in continuing to meet the
goals for subcontracting during the term of the contract.  The report shall
also note any significant issues that arose during the contract that may have
resulted in decreased participation as subcontractors by Black-owned
businesses, Black male-owned businesses, Black women-owned businesses, Asian
American-owned businesses, Asian American male-owned businesses, Asian American
women-owned businesses, Hispanic-owned businesses, Hispanic male-owned
businesses, Hispanic women-owned businesses, and nonminority women-owned
businesses.  The State agency or State contracting unit shall review all
reports with the chief to continually refine its contract terms to promote
successful implementation of the policy of the State to promote markets for all
State contracts and subcontracts that are free from discrimination against
women and minorities, and to encourage participation of minority and
nonminority women-owned businesses, as well as small businesses in all areas of
State contracting; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   take any other action
that the chief determines to be appropriate to effectuate rules adopted by the
State Treasurer.  This may include, but shall not be limited to, a provision
providing for appropriate relief should any contractor knowingly and willfully
fail to comply with the goal requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  (1) Each <span
style='color:black'>prime contractor</span> shall make a good faith effort to
attain the subcontractor goals established in this section.  For purposes of
determining a contractors good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting
requirements of this section, the <span style='color:black'>State </span>agency
or State contracting unit shall consider:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) whether the contractor has
promoted the subcontracting opportunity to, or otherwise made minority
businesses and nonminority women-owned business aware of the opportunity, in
such event, (i) whether minority businesses and nonminority women-owned
businesses exhibited interest in working with the contractor on a particular
project by attending, or having attended, a pre-bid conference, if any,
scheduled by the <span style='color:black'>State </span>agency or State
contracting unit awarding the contract; and (ii) minority businesses and nonminority
women-owned businesses, which have been solicited by the contractor, have
responded in a timely fashion to the contractors request to engage minority businesses
and nonminority women-owned businesses prior to the <span style='color:black'>State
</span>agencys or State contracting units bid submission deadline;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b) whether the contractor
provided timely written notification of subcontracting opportunities on the contract
to appropriate minority businesses and nonminority women-owned businesses that
appear in the States electronic database; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c) whether the contractor can
reasonably structure the amount of work to be performed under subcontracts to
increase the likelihood of participation by minority businesses and nonminority
women-owned businesses; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d) whether other actions
determined appropriate by the chief through rules adopted by the State
Treasurer pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410
(C.52:14B-1 et seq.), were taken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Failure on the part of a
contractor to demonstrate a good faith effort may be grounds for the rejection
of bids made by that contractor on the contract for which the contractor is
required to make a good faith effort to comply with the subcontracting
requirements of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) Contractors shall comply
with the goal requirements of this section for the duration of the contract. 
If the contractor removes, adds, or changes a subcontractor, the contractor is
required to comply with the goal requirements of this section to the same as its
original bid or demonstrate that good faith efforts were taken to comply with
the requirements of this section.  Failure on the part of a contractor to
comply or demonstrate a good faith effort during the term of the contract, and
any extensions thereto, will result in the State agency or State contracting
unit advising the chief of the contractors noncompliance in the report
required pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) Upon receiving any such
report from a State agency or State contracting unit alleging that a contractor
failed to meet the requirements of this section or did not make good faith
efforts to comply with those requirements, the chief shall conduct a mandatory
plenary review of the contractors efforts to comply with the requirements of
this section and shall determine if any action should be taken against the
contractor.  The State agency or State contracting unit and the contractor
shall comply with the chiefs requests for documents and information to support
the plenary review.  Upon completion of the plenary review, if the chief
determines that the contractor failed to meet or failed to make a good faith
effort to meet the goal requirements of this section, the chief may issue an
order taking appropriate action against the contractor, which may include one
or more of the following:  (a) order the contractor to complete mandatory
training at the contractors own expense prior to bidding on any State
contract; (b) bypass the future award of one or more pending contract awards;
(c) debar the contractor from State contracting for a period of time of up to
five years; and (d) mandate such other relief as the chief deems appropriate.</p>
