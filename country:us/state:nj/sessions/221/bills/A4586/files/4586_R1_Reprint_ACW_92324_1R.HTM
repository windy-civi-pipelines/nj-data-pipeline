Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) Sections 1
through 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this
bill) shall be known and may be cited as the Minority and Women-Owned
Businesses State Contractor Remedies Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.  In 1985, the Legislature passed
the Set-Aside Act for Small Businesses, Female Businesses, and Minority Businesses,
P.L.1983, c.482 (C.52:32-17 et seq.), requiring that 15 percent of contracts be
awarded to small businesses, seven percent to minority businesses, and three
percent to women-owned businesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  In 1989, the United States
Supreme Court held in <u>City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co. (Croson)</u>, 488
U.S. 469 (1989), that the City of Richmonds subcontractor set-aside program for
minority businesses violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because
it did not meet the Courts strict scrutiny standard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.  Following the <u>Croson</u>
decision, Governor Kean suspended portions of the Set-Aside Act because the State
had not undertaken a thorough investigation confirming the existence of race
and gender discrimination in State procurement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.  In August 1989, Governor Kean
issued Executive Order No. 213 establishing the Governors Study Commission on Discrimination
in Public Work Procurement and Construction Contracts and directed the Study Commission
to investigate the nature and scope of any discriminatory practices and
prepare an analysis of this information in order to develop probative evidence
of any prior to present discrimination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.  The Study Commission
released the States first disparity study in 1993, with the statistical findings
showing a disparity between contract dollars awarded and the availability of
minority and women-owned firms available to provide goods and services, and the
anecdotal findings showing a history of far-reaching discrimination in which
the State passively participated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.  Governor Florio issued
Executive Order No. 84 in 1993 reinstituting the goals in the Set-Aside Act,
requiring all State contracting agencies to adopt a set-aside program wherein
they would make a good faith effort to award seven percent of public
procurement and construction contracts to minority businesses and three percent
to women-owned businesses.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.  In 2003, the Set-Aside Act
was permanently enjoined in a Consent Decree entered by the federal district court
in the matter of <u>GEOD v. State of New Jersey</u>, Civil Action No. 01-2656 (SRC)
(D.N.J.), and following entry of the Consent Decree, Governor McGreevey issued Executive
Order No. 71 (2003) eliminating set-aside goals for minority and women-owned businesses
and instead instituting a race- and gender-neutral small business set-aside program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.  In 2005, the State released
an updated disparity study, and in 2006, Governor Corzine issued Executive Order
No. 34, creating the Division of Minority and Women Business Development,
tasking it with developing minority and women business utilization goals, based
on the 1993 and 2005 disparity studies, and developing and implementing policies
and programs aimed at meeting those goals through race-and gender-neutral means.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.  On January 23, 2024, the
State released a comprehensive statewide disparity study examining public contracting
opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses between 2015 and 2020.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.  Despite decades of a race-
and gender-neutral small business set-aside program and other remedial
measures, the study found statistically significant disparities in public contracting
with minority and women-owned business enterprises including specifically in contracting
with businesses owned by Black Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans
and women for formal prime contracts in construction, professional services, and
goods and services and for informal prime contracts across all industries studied.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.  The State has a compelling
interest in promoting markets free of discrimination to engage contractors and
subcontractors for State contracts of all types, and thus to promote
contracting with minority owned and women-owned businesses that are available
and qualified to be State contractors and subcontractors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.  It is the policy of the
State to promote markets for all State contracts and subcontracts that are free
from discrimination against women and minorities, and to encourage participation
of minority and women-owned businesses as well as small businesses in all areas
of State contracting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.  In an effort to reduce
barriers to participation by minority and women-owned businesses in State
contracting, State agencies <b><sup><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b><u>,
State contracting units,</u><b><sup><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>1</span></sup></b>
and prime contractors should be subject to defined criteria evidencing a good
faith effort to increase participation by such businesses. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.  The contracting goals set
forth in P.L.   , c.  (C.     ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill)
are established consistent with the findings of the New Jersey disparity study
released in January of 2024 and are tailored to address the reports findings
of significant statistical disparities in the States contract awards.</p>
