<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  (New section)   The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    New Jersey has a high
prevalence of adults living with behavioral health conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Studies conducted by
nationally and internationally recognized medical institutions indicate that
psilocybin has shown efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of a
variety of behavioral health conditions, including, but not limited to,
clinical dependence disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, and end-of-life
psychological distress.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The United States Food
and Drug Administration has determined that preliminary clinical evidence
indicates psilocybin may demonstrate substantial improvement over available
therapies for treatment-resistant depression, and has granted a breakthrough
therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for
treatment-resistant depression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    It is the intent of the
Legislature to facilitate the establishment of safe, legal, and affordable
psilocybin service centers to provide residents of New Jersey who are 21 years
of age or older with opportunities for supported psilocybin experiences to
alleviate distress, provide preventative behavioral health care, and foster
wellness and personal growth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    In establishing this
act, the Legislature seeks to improve the physical, mental, and social
well-being of all residents of New Jersey, and to prevent and reduce the
prevalence of behavioral health disorders in adults, by providing for supported
adult use of psilocybin under the supervision of trained and licensed
psilocybin service facilitators.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The Legislature further
seeks to develop a long-term Statewide strategic plan for ensuring that
psilocybin services become and remain a safe, accessible, and affordable
treatment option for people age 21 and older in New Jersey for whom behavioral
health treatment and preventative behavioral health care using psilocybin is
appropriate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is necessary and
appropriate to develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme to ensure that
psilocybin can be accessed in safe, controlled environments that are designed
to foster improvements in behavioral health for adult patients, including
establishing requirements for the licensure and regulation of psilocybin
product manufacturers and psilocybin service providers, as well as requirements
to restrict access to psilocybin to adults age 21 and older and to prevent the
unlawful diversion of psilocybin in the State.</p>
