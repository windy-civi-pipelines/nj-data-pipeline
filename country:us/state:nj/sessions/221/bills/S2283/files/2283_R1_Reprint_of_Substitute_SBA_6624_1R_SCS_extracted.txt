CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee on October 7, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning the production and use of psilocybin for certain purposes, supplementing Title 24 of the Revised Statutes, and amending Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section)   This act shall be known and may be cited as the Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Act. 2.  (New section)   The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jersey has a high prevalence of adults living with behavioral health conditions. b.    Studies conducted by nationally and internationally recognized medical institutions indicate that psilocybin has shown efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of a variety of behavioral health conditions, including, but not limited to, clinical dependence disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, and end-of-life psychological distress. c.     The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that preliminary clinical evidence indicates psilocybin may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies for treatment-resistant depression, and has granted a breakthrough therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression. d.    It is the intent of the Legislature to facilitate the establishment of safe, legal, and affordable psilocybin service centers to provide residents of New Jersey who are 21 years of age or older with opportunities for supported psilocybin experiences to alleviate distress, provide preventative behavioral health care, and foster wellness and personal growth. e.     In establishing this act, the Legislature seeks to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of all residents of New Jersey, and to prevent and reduce the prevalence of behavioral health disorders in adults, by providing for supported adult use of psilocybin under the supervision of trained and licensed psilocybin service facilitators. f.     The Legislature further seeks to develop a long-term Statewide strategic plan for ensuring that psilocybin services become and remain a safe, accessible, and affordable treatment option for people age 21 and older in New Jersey for whom behavioral health treatment and preventative behavioral health care using psilocybin is appropriate. g.    It is necessary and appropriate to develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme to ensure that psilocybin can be accessed in safe, controlled environments that are designed to foster improvements in behavioral health for adult patients, including establishing requirements for the licensure and regulation of psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service providers, as well as requirements to restrict access to psilocybin to adults age 21 and older and to prevent the unlawful diversion of psilocybin in the State. 3.

center operator, psilocybin testing laboratory, or psilocybin service facilitator, or for a psilocybin worker permit, shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the department clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the department shall consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position that the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (4)   the

(New section)  a.  The department shall designate specific psilocybin manufacturing activities that shall be authorized for psilocybin product manufacturers, and a psilocybin product manufacturer shall not engage in a psilocybin manufacturing activity unless the manufacturer holds an endorsement authorizing the manufacturer to engage in that specific activity.  A psilocybin product manufacturer shall not be limited in the number of endorsements the manufacturer holds at one time, and a psilocybin product manufacturer may request approval from the department for additional endorsements at any time.  The department shall approve a request for an additional endorsement unless the department determines that the psilocybin product manufacturer will be unable to meet the requirements for the requested endorsement.  Denial of a request for an additional endorsement shall not preclude a manufacturer from submitting a subsequent request for approval of the same or any other endorsement. b.    The department may restrict the quantity or volume of psilocybin annually produced by a psilocybin product manufacturer, which may include establishing specific, lower quantity or volume limits for psilocybin product manufacturers issued a microbusiness license pursuant to subsection d. of this section.  In establishing quantity or volume restrictions pursuant to this subsection, the department shall take into consideration the demand for psilocybin services in the State, the number of entities issued psilocybin product manufacturer licenses and the number of applicants for psilocybin product manufacturer licenses, and the number of each type of endorsement held by psilocybin product manufacturers, as well as the geographic distribution of licensees, applicants, and endorsements throughout the State. c.     In no case shall psilocybin manufacturing activities be conducted in an outdoor area. d.    (1) The department shall establish a psilocybin product manufacturer microbusiness license, for which the maximum fee assessed by the department for issuance or renewal of the license shall be no more than half the fee applicable to full psilocybin product manufacturer license.  A license issued to a microbusiness shall be valid for one year and may be renewed annually. (2)   A microbusiness shall meet the following requirements: (a)   at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, and employees of the microbusiness shall be residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located, or a municipality bordering the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located; (b)   the microbusiness shall employ no more than 10 employees at one time, inclusive of any owners, officers, and directors of the microbusiness; and (c)   the entire microbusiness facility shall occupy an area of no more than 2,500 square feet. 19.  (New section) a.  A psilocybin service center shall not constitute a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.163 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). b.    (1)  Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, a psilocybin service center shall not be approved for any location that is entirely zoned for residential use or that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school. (2)   (a)  A psilocybin service center may be approved for a location that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school if the psilocybin service center is not located within 500 feet of an elementary or secondary school and the center does not use any signage that is attractive to minors. (b)  As used in this paragraph, attractive to minors means a design that includes: cartoons; a design, brand, or name that resembles a non-psilocybin consumer product of the type that is typically marketed to minors; symbols or celebrities that are commonly used to market products to minors; images of minors; or words that refer to products that are commonly associated with minors or marketed by minors. (3)   An existing psilocybin service center shall not be required to relocate in the event an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center for such time as the psilocybin service center continues to hold a valid license issued by the department.  The department may not revoke the license of a psilocybin service center solely on the grounds that an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center. c.     Psilocybin service center operators shall take steps to prevent noisy, lewd, disorderly, and disruptive conduct on the licensees premises, and shall ensure the premises are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. 20.

Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section)   This act shall be known and may be cited as the Psilocybin Behavioral Health Access and Services Act. 2.  (New section)   The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     New Jersey has a high prevalence of adults living with behavioral health conditions. b.    Studies conducted by nationally and internationally recognized medical institutions indicate that psilocybin has shown efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of a variety of behavioral health conditions, including, but not limited to, clinical dependence disorders, depression, anxiety disorders, and end-of-life psychological distress. c.     The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that preliminary clinical evidence indicates psilocybin may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapies for treatment-resistant depression, and has granted a breakthrough therapy designation for a treatment that uses psilocybin as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression. d.    It is the intent of the Legislature to facilitate the establishment of safe, legal, and affordable psilocybin service centers to provide residents of New Jersey who are 21 years of age or older with opportunities for supported psilocybin experiences to alleviate distress, provide preventative behavioral health care, and foster wellness and personal growth. e.     In establishing this act, the Legislature seeks to improve the physical, mental, and social well-being of all residents of New Jersey, and to prevent and reduce the prevalence of behavioral health disorders in adults, by providing for supported adult use of psilocybin under the supervision of trained and licensed psilocybin service facilitators. f.     The Legislature further seeks to develop a long-term Statewide strategic plan for ensuring that psilocybin services become and remain a safe, accessible, and affordable treatment option for people age 21 and older in New Jersey for whom behavioral health treatment and preventative behavioral health care using psilocybin is appropriate. g.    It is necessary and appropriate to develop a comprehensive regulatory scheme to ensure that psilocybin can be accessed in safe, controlled environments that are designed to foster improvements in behavioral health for adult patients, including establishing requirements for the licensure and regulation of psilocybin product manufacturers and psilocybin service providers, as well as requirements to restrict access to psilocybin to adults age 21 and older and to prevent the unlawful diversion of psilocybin in the State. 3.

for an applicant to be licensed as a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, psilocybin testing laboratory, or psilocybin service facilitator, or to be issued a psilocybin worker permit, for a period not to exceed three months if the applicant submits to the department a sworn statement attesting that the applicant has not been convicted of any disqualifying conviction pursuant to this section. i.     Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection e. of this section to the contrary, no applicant for licensure as a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, psilocybin testing laboratory, or psilocybin service facilitator, or for a psilocybin worker permit, shall be disqualified on the basis of any conviction disclosed by a criminal history record background check conducted pursuant to this section if the individual has affirmatively demonstrated to the department clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation.  In determining whether clear and convincing evidence of rehabilitation has been demonstrated, the department shall consider the following factors: (1)   the nature and responsibility of the position that the convicted individual would hold, has held, or currently holds; (2)   the nature and seriousness of the crime or offense; (3)   the circumstances under which the crime or offense occurred; (4)   the

the individual under their supervision. 12.  (New section)  a.  The department shall not issue any license to a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory if the premises of the psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, or psilocybin testing laboratory are not clearly described and defined in the application. b.    No application for a psilocybin product manufacturer or psilocybin service center operator license shall be approved unless it includes a description of the proposed location for the applicant's site, including: (1)   the proposed location, the surrounding area, and the suitability or advantages of the proposed location, along with a floor plan and optional renderings or architectural or engineering plans; and (2)   the submission of zoning approvals for the proposed location, which shall consist of a letter or affidavit from appropriate municipal officials that the location will

center operator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license, to submit to the department a sworn statement identifying the name and address of each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure, and the nature and extent of the financial interest held by each person holding a financial interest in the licensee or the applicant for licensure. 14.  (New section)  a.  The department shall establish and administer a social opportunity program to assist individuals who qualify as social opportunity applicants and who otherwise meet the requirements for issuance of a psilocybin product manufacturer, psilocybin service center, psilocybin service facilitator, or psilocybin testing laboratory license pursuant to this act. b.    An applicant for a psilocybin

(New section)  a.  The department shall designate specific psilocybin manufacturing activities that shall be authorized for psilocybin product manufacturers, and a psilocybin product manufacturer shall not engage in a psilocybin manufacturing activity unless the manufacturer holds an endorsement authorizing the manufacturer to engage in that specific activity.  A psilocybin product manufacturer shall not be limited in the number of endorsements the manufacturer holds at one time, and a psilocybin product manufacturer may request approval from the department for additional endorsements at any time.  The department shall approve a request for an additional endorsement unless the department determines that the psilocybin product manufacturer will be unable to meet the requirements for the requested endorsement.  Denial of a request for an additional endorsement shall not preclude a manufacturer from submitting a subsequent request for approval of the same or any other endorsement. b.    The department may restrict the quantity or volume of psilocybin annually produced by a psilocybin product manufacturer, which may include establishing specific, lower quantity or volume limits for psilocybin product manufacturers issued a microbusiness license pursuant to subsection d. of this section.  In establishing quantity or volume restrictions pursuant to this subsection, the department shall take into consideration the demand for psilocybin services in the State, the number of entities issued psilocybin product manufacturer licenses and the number of applicants for psilocybin product manufacturer licenses, and the number of each type of endorsement held by psilocybin product manufacturers, as well as the geographic distribution of licensees, applicants, and endorsements throughout the State. c.     In no case shall psilocybin manufacturing activities be conducted in an outdoor area. d.    (1) The department shall establish a psilocybin product manufacturer microbusiness license, for which the maximum fee assessed by the department for issuance or renewal of the license shall be no more than half the fee applicable to full psilocybin product manufacturer license.  A license issued to a microbusiness shall be valid for one year and may be renewed annually. (2)   A microbusiness shall meet the following requirements: (a)   at least 51 percent of the owners, directors, officers, and employees of the microbusiness shall be residents of the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located, or a municipality bordering the municipality in which the microbusiness is or will be located; (b)   the microbusiness shall employ no more than 10 employees at one time, inclusive of any owners, officers, and directors of the microbusiness; and (c)   the entire microbusiness facility shall occupy an area of no more than 2,500 square feet. 19.  (New section) a.  A psilocybin service center shall not constitute a health care facility licensed pursuant to P.L.1971, c.163 (C.26:2H-1 et seq.). b.    (1)  Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, a psilocybin service center shall not be approved for any location that is entirely zoned for residential use or that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school. (2)   (a)  A psilocybin service center may be approved for a location that is within 1,000 feet of an elementary or secondary school if the psilocybin service center is not located within 500 feet of an elementary or secondary school and the center does not use any signage that is attractive to minors. (b)  As used in this paragraph, attractive to minors means a design that includes: cartoons; a design, brand, or name that resembles a non-psilocybin consumer product of the type that is typically marketed to minors; symbols or celebrities that are commonly used to market products to minors; images of minors; or words that refer to products that are commonly associated with minors or marketed by minors. (3)   An existing psilocybin service center shall not be required to relocate in the event an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center for such time as the psilocybin service center continues to hold a valid license issued by the department.  The department may not revoke the license of a psilocybin service center solely on the grounds that an elementary or secondary school is newly constructed within 1,000 feet of the psilocybin service center. c.     Psilocybin service center operators shall take steps to prevent noisy, lewd, disorderly, and disruptive conduct on the licensees premises, and shall ensure the premises are maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. 20.
