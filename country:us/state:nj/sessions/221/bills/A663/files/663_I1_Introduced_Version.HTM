dismissed, the person was acquitted, or the person was discharged without a
conviction or finding of guilt, the Superior Court shall, at the time of
dismissal, acquittal, or discharge, or, in any case set forth in paragraph (1)
of this subsection, order the expungement of all records and information

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide that
no criminal conviction, arrest, or charge involving domestic violence could be
expunged.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the court
may order the records of a criminal conviction expunged under certain
circumstances following an application by a person who has been convicted of a
crime, disorderly persons offense, or petty disorderly persons offense. Certain
serious crimes are barred by statute from expungement, including murder,
kidnapping, human trafficking, sexual assault, and arson, among others. This
bill would add all crimes and offenses involving domestic violence, as defined in
section 3 of P.L.1991, c.261 (C.2C:25-19), to the list of crimes and offenses
that are barred from expungement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law also provides that
when a person is ultimately not convicted of a crime or offense following an
arrest or charge, the court will automatically order the records of the arrest
or charge expunged. This bill would make an exception if the underlying crime
or offense involved domestic violence, thus barring such expungements.</p>
