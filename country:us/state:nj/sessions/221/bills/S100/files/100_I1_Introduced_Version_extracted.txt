(2)   The purchase information obtained from the seller pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be submitted to the commission as part of an application to receive financial assistance through the fund.  Once the application has been submitted to the commission, the commission shall render a decision on the application within 60 days from the date of receipt of the application.  If the application is approved by the commission, payment shall be remitted directly to the seller and, as necessary, any business entities making subsequent modifications to the vehicle within 30 days after the: (a)   application to receive financial assistance is approved; and (b)   delivery of and any subsequent modifications needed to accommodate the child are made to the motor vehicle purchased pursuant to paragraph (12) of subsection a. of this section. (3)   As used in this section, seller means a motor vehicle dealer licensed pursuant to R.S.39:10-19 et seq., or any other motor vehicle mobility dealer that exclusively engages in the selling of specialized, modified motor vehicles specifically designed to facilitate use or operation by an aging individual or an individual with disabilities. (cf: P.L.2003, c.260, s.3) 2.    Section 10 of P.L.1987, c.370 (C.26:2-157) is amended to read as follows: 10.  For the purpose of providing the moneys necessary to establish and meet the purposes of the fund, the commission shall establish a [$1.50] $3 annual surcharge per employee for all employers who are subject to the New Jersey "Unemployment Compensation Law[,]", R.S. 43:21-1 et seq.  The surcharge shall be collected by the controller for the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Fund and paid over to the State Treasurer for deposit in the fund annually as provided by the commission. (cf: P.L.2007, c.342, s.2) 3.    This act shall take effect 60 days after enactment. STATEMENT This bill, designated as Marys Law, requires that financial assistance given through monies from the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, for the purposes of purchasing a specialized, modified motor vehicle, be provided through direct payments to the seller of that vehicle and, as necessary, to a business entity that may perform subsequent modifications to the vehicle to make it accessible to a child with a catastrophic illness within 30 days after the application to receive financial assistance is approved and the delivery of, and any subsequent modifications needed to accommodate the child are made to, the motor vehicle. Currently, purchases for these vehicles are reimbursed through the fund to families after the expenses have already been incurred. It is often the case, however, that a family does not have the money upfront to purchase the vehicle and pay for the subsequent modifications for disabled transport. It is the view of the sponsor that direct payments as specified in the bill will allow more families to purchase these vehicles. The bill also specifies the services which are eligible for payment or reimbursement through the fund. Currently, the type of financial assistance from the fund includes, but is not limited to, payments or reimbursements for medical treatment, hospital care, drugs, nursing care and physician services.  The bill mandates that financial assistance through the fund includes payments or reimbursement, as appropriate, for the cost of the services specified under the bills provisions. Additionally, the bill provides that the current funding mechanism for the program, which is a $1.50 annual surcharge per employee for all employers who are subject to the New Jersey "Unemployment Compensation Law, is increased to $3 per employee. The Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund is a financial assistance program for New Jersey families whose children have an illness or condition that is otherwise uncovered by insurance, State or federal programs, or other source, and that exceeds 10 percent of the first $100,000 of annual family income plus 15 percent of the excess income over $100,000. The fund is intended to assist in preserving a familys ability to cope with the responsibilities which accompany a childs significant health problems.
