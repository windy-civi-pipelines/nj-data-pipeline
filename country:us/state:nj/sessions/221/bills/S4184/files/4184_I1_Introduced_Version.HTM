These spaces would be the most accessible, after those designated for use by handicapped persons.  The spaces would have to be outlined in green paint and identified with a sign displaying Hybrid and Alternatives Parking Only in green. The bill directs the Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission to issue window stickers to identify vehicles which may be parked in parking spaces designated for hybrid, electric, and alternative fuel vehicles, and outlines the standards for eligible vehicles. Drivers of vehicles parked in these spaces without a sticker would be subject to a $250 fine. The bill would be effective for 10 years, during which time the chief administrator would provide the Legislature with relevant information for its evaluation.
