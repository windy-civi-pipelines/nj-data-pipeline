Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 8 of P.L.2017,
c.117 (C.26:2S-29) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.  A carrier that
offers a health benefits plan in this State shall provide coverage and payment
for health care services delivered to a covered person through telemedicine or
telehealth, on the same basis as, and at a provider reimbursement rate that <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>does not
exceed<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>equals</u> the provider reimbursement rate that is applicable, when the
services are delivered through in-person contact and consultation in New
Jersey, provided the services are otherwise covered under the plan when
delivered through in-person contact and consultation in New Jersey. 
Reimbursement payments under this section may be provided either to the
individual practitioner who delivered the reimbursable services, or to the
agency, facility, or organization that employs the individual practitioner who
delivered the reimbursable services, as appropriate.  <u>The requirements of
this subsection shall not apply to a health care service provided by a
telemedicine or telehealth organization that does not provide the health care
service on an in-person basis in New Jersey.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A carrier may limit
coverage to services that are delivered by health care providers in the health
benefits plan's network, but may not charge any deductible, copayment, or
coinsurance for a health care service, delivered through telemedicine or
telehealth, in an amount that exceeds the deductible, copayment, or coinsurance
amount that is applicable to an in-person consultation.  In no case shall a
carrier: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   impose any restrictions
on the location or setting of the distant site used by a health care provider
to provide services using telemedicine and telehealth or on the location or
setting of the originating site where the patient is located when receiving
services using telemedicine and telehealth, except to ensure that the services
provided using telemedicine and telehealth meet the same standard of care as
would be provided if the services were provided in person;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   restrict the ability of
a provider to use any electronic or technological platform to provide services
using telemedicine or telehealth, including, but not limited to, interactive,
real-time, two-way audio, which may be used in combination with asynchronous
store-and-forward technology without video capabilities, including audio-only
telephone conversations, to provide services using telemedicine or telehealth,
provided that the platform used:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a) allows the provider to
meet the same standard of care as would be provided if the services were
provided in person; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   is compliant with the
requirements of the federal health privacy rule set forth at 45 CFR Parts 160
and 164;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   deny coverage for or
refuse to provide reimbursement for routine patient monitoring performed using
telemedicine and telehealth, including remote monitoring of a patient's vital
signs and routine check-ins with the patient to monitor the patient's status
and condition, if coverage and reimbursement would be provided if those
services are provided in person, and the provider is able to meet the same
standard of care as would be provided if the services were provided in person;
or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) limit coverage only to
services delivered by select third-party telemedicine or telehealth
organizations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Nothing in this section
shall be construed to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   prohibit a carrier from
providing coverage for only those services that are medically necessary,
subject to the terms and conditions of the covered person's health benefits
plan; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   allow a carrier to
require a covered person to use telemedicine or telehealth in lieu of receiving
an in-person service from an in-network provider.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The Commissioner of
Banking and Insurance shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the
