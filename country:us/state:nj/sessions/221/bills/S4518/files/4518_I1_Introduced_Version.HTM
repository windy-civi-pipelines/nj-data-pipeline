S4518 SENATE, No. 4518 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 29, 2025 Sponsored by: Senator  LATHAM TIVER District 8 (Atlantic and Burlington) SYNOPSIS Electricity Bill Transparency Act; requires electric utilities to separately list amounts of certain charges. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act requiring electric utilities to separately list the amount of certain charges, amending P.L.1966, c.30 and P.L.1999, c.23, and supplementing Title 48 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  (New section)  This act shall be known and may be cited as the Electricity Bill Transparency Act. 2.  Section 14 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-14) is amended to read as follows: 14.  (a) Every person required to collect any tax imposed by this act shall be personally liable for the tax imposed, collected or required to be collected under this act.  Any such person shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from that person's customer or in respect to non-payment of the tax by the customer as if the tax were a part of the purchase price of the property or service, amusement charge or rent, as the case may be, and payable at the same time; provided, however, that the director shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought to collect the tax. (b)   Where any customer has failed to pay a tax imposed by this act to the person required to collect the same, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, such tax shall be payable by the customer directly to the director and it shall be the duty of the customer to file a return with the director and to pay the tax to the director within 20 days of the date the tax was required to be paid. (c)   The director may, whenever the director deems it necessary for the proper enforcement of this act, provide by regulation that customers shall file returns and pay directly to the director any tax herein imposed, at such times as returns are required to be filed and payment over made by persons required to collect the tax. (d)   No person required to collect any tax imposed by this act shall advertise or hold out to any person or to the public in general, in any manner, directly or indirectly, that the tax is not considered as an element in the price, amusement charge or rent payable by the customer, or except as provided by subsection (f) of this section that the person required to collect the tax will pay the tax, that the tax will not be separately charged and stated to the customer or that the tax will be refunded to the customer.  Upon written application duly made and proof duly presented to the satisfaction of the director showing that in the particular business of the person required to collect the tax it would be impractical for the seller to separately charge the tax to the customer, the director may waive the application of the requirement herein as to such seller. (e)   All sellers of energy or utility service shall include the tax imposed by the "Sales and Use Tax Act" within the purchase price of the tangible personal property or service.  A seller of electricity service to retail customers in this State shall include on each bill for electricity service rendered to a customer, the amount of the tax imposed by the "Sales and Use Tax Act" attributable to that customer, which amount shall be listed separately from any other charges included in the purchase price of the electricity services rendered to that customer. (f)   A seller other than a seller subject to subsection (e) of this section making retail sales of tangible personal property or sales of services may advertise that the seller will pay the tax for the customer subject to the conditions of this subsection. (1)   The advertising shall indicate that the seller is, in fact, paying the tax for the customer and shall not indicate or imply that the sale or charge is exempt from taxation. (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-12) to the contrary, any sales slip, invoice, receipt or other statement or memorandum of the price or service charge paid or payable given to the customer shall state that the tax will be paid by the seller; provided however that such record shall be otherwise subject to the provisions of section 12 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-12). (3)   The seller shall pay the amount of tax due on the retail sale or service receipt, as determined pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-4), as trustee for and on account of the State, and shall have the same liability for that amount of tax pursuant to the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.), as for an amount collected from a customer. (g)   No person required to collect any tax imposed by this act shall be held liable for having charged and collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax by reason of reliance on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries or taxing jurisdiction assignments or contained in the taxability matrix. (h)   In connection with a purchaser's request from a seller of over-collected sales or use taxes, a seller shall be presumed to have a reasonable business practice, if in the collection of such sales or use taxes, the seller: (1) uses either a provider or a system, including a proprietary system, that is certified by the State; and (2) has remitted to the State all taxes collected less any deductions, credits, or collection allowances. (i)    No purchaser shall be held liable for any tax, interest or penalty for failure to pay the correct amount of tax by reason of: (1)   the reliance of the purchaser's seller or certified service provider on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries or taxing jurisdiction assignments or contained in the taxability matrix; (2)   the reliance of the purchaser holding a direct pay permit on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries or taxing jurisdiction assignments or contained in the taxability matrix; (3)   the reliance of the purchaser on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to the taxability matrix; or (4)   the reliance of a purchaser using databases of taxing jurisdiction assignments on erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries or taxing jurisdiction assignments, provided however that, to the extent that the director provides or certifies an address-based database for assigning tax rates and jurisdictions and upon appropriate notice, no relief from liability shall be allowed for errors resulting from reliance on a zip code database for assigning tax rates and jurisdictions. Provided however, that as to the relief from liability for tax, the relief from liability for tax by reason of reliance on the taxability matrix shall be limited to the director's erroneous classification in the taxability matrix of terms "taxable" or "exempt," "included in sales price" or "excluded from sales price" or "included in the definition" or "excluded from the definition." (j)    If the director provides less than 30 days between the date a rate change is enacted and the date that change takes effect, the director shall relieve the seller of liability for failing to collect tax at the new rate if:  (1) the seller collected tax at the immediately preceding effective rate; and (2) the seller's failure to collect tax at the newly effective rate does not extend more than 30 days after the date of enactment of the new rate. (k)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (j) of this section, if the director establishes that a seller fraudulently failed to collect tax due at the new rate or solicits purchasers based on the immediately preceding effective tax rate, this relief from liability shall not apply. (cf: P.L.2011, c.49, s.12) 3.  Section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a. Simultaneously with the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate: (1) The costs for the social programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the board chooses to modify the program; (2) Nuclear plant decommissioning costs; (3) The costs of demand side management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment, and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for energy efficiency, light, medium, and heavy-duty plug-in electric vehicles, including school buses, and associated plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and Class I renewable energy programs that provide environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and provided that 25 percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells.  The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs' costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer period of time.  The board shall make these determinations taking into consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public utility and gas public utility customer funding; (4) Manufactured gas plant remediation costs, which shall be determined initially in a manner consistent with mechanisms in the remediation adjustment clauses for the electric public utility and gas public utility adopted by the board; and (5) The cost, of consumer education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that, together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-79), shall be sufficient to fund the consumer education program established pursuant to section 36 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-85). b.    There is established in the Board of Public Utilities a nonlapsing fund to be known as the "Universal Service Fund."  The board shall determine: the level of funding and the appropriate administration of the fund; the purposes and programs to be funded with monies from the fund; which social programs shall be provided by an electric public utility as part of the provision of its regulated services which provide a public benefit; whether the funds appropriated to fund the "Lifeline Credit Program" established pursuant to P.L.1979, c.197 (C.48:2-29.15 et seq.), the "Tenants' Lifeline Assistance Program" established pursuant to P.L.1981, c.210 (C.48:2-29.30 et seq.), the funds received pursuant to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s.8621 et seq., and funds collected by electric and gas public utilities, as authorized by the board, to offset uncollectible electricity and natural gas bills should be deposited in the fund; and whether new charges should be imposed to fund new or expanded social programs. c. An electric public utility shall include on each bill for electricity services rendered to a customer, the amount of the societal benefits charge imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section attributable to that customer, which amount shall be listed separately from any other charges included in the purchase price of the electricity services rendered to that customer.  On each bill for electricity services rendered to a customer, an electric public utility shall itemize the amount of societal benefits charge that is imposed on that bill and provided to each societal benefits charge program. (cf: P.L.2022, c.86, s.2) 4.  (New section)  a.  As used in this section, clean energy charge means any energy efficiency and conservation charge, including, but not limited to, the Zero emission certificate program pursuant to P.L.2018, c.16 (C.48:3-87.3 et seq.), imposed by the electric public utility on a customer that is not otherwise charged as part of the societal benefits charge pursuant to section 12 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-60). b. An electric public utility shall include on each bill for electricity services rendered to a customer the amount of each clean energy charge attributable to that customer, which amount shall be listed separately from any other charges included in the purchase price of electricity services rendered to that customer. 5.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the six month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill is to be known as the Electricity Bill Transparency Act.  This bill requires electric public utilities to separately list the amount of tax imposed by the Sales and Use Tax Act, the amount of the societal benefits charge, and the amount of clean energy charges on each customers electricity bill. Additionally, the bill requires electric public utilities to itemize the amount of the societal benefits charge that is provided to each societal benefits program on the customers electricity bill. This bill is intended to provide notice to customers of electricity service, on their bills, about the types and amount of charges that are imposed but are not directly related to the cost of providing electricity to the customer.  Many customers are unaware of these non-utility related charges and that these charges fund programs that these customers may not use.
