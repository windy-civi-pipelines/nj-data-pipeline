<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  (New section)  This act
shall be known and may be cited as the Electricity Bill Transparency Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  Section 14 of P.L.1966,
c.30 (C.54:32B-14) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     14.  (a) Every person required
to collect any tax imposed by this act shall be personally liable for the tax
imposed, collected or required to be collected under this act.  Any such person
shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from that person's
customer or in respect to non-payment of the tax by the customer as if the tax
were a part of the purchase price of the property or service, amusement charge
or rent, as the case may be, and payable at the same time; provided, however,
that the director shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought
to collect the tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Where any customer has
failed to pay a tax imposed by this act to the person required to collect the
same, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided,
such tax shall be payable by the customer directly to the director and it shall
be the duty of the customer to file a return with the director and to pay the
tax to the director within 20 days of the date the tax was required to be paid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)   The director may,
whenever the director deems it necessary for the proper enforcement of this
act, provide by regulation that customers shall file returns and pay directly
to the director any tax herein imposed, at such times as returns are required
to be filed and payment over made by persons required to collect the tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)   No person required to
collect any tax imposed by this act shall advertise or hold out to any person
or to the public in general, in any manner, directly or indirectly, that the
tax is not considered as an element in the price, amusement charge or rent
payable by the customer, or except as provided by subsection (f) of this
section that the person required to collect the tax will pay the tax, that the
tax will not be separately charged and stated to the customer or that the tax
will be refunded to the customer.  Upon written application duly made and proof
duly presented to the satisfaction of the director showing that in the
particular business of the person required to collect the tax it would be
impractical for the seller to separately charge the tax to the customer, the
director may waive the application of the requirement herein as to such seller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (e)   All sellers of energy or
utility service shall include the tax imposed by the &quot;Sales and Use Tax
Act&quot; within the purchase price of the tangible personal property or
service.  <u>A seller of electricity service to retail customers in this State
shall include on each bill for electricity service rendered to a customer, the
amount of the tax imposed by the &quot;Sales and Use Tax Act&quot; attributable
to that customer, which amount shall be listed separately from any other
charges included in the purchase price of the electricity services rendered to
that customer.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (f)   A seller other than a
seller subject to subsection (e) of this section making retail sales of tangible
personal property or sales of services may advertise that the seller will pay
the tax for the customer subject to the conditions of this subsection.<span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:150%;color:black;letter-spacing:0pt'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   The advertising shall
indicate that the seller is, in fact, paying the tax for the customer and shall
not indicate or imply that the sale or charge is exempt from taxation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   Notwithstanding the
provisions of section 12 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-12) to the contrary, any
sales slip, invoice, receipt or other statement or memorandum of the price or
service charge paid or payable given to the customer shall state that the tax
will be paid by the seller; provided however that such record shall be
otherwise subject to the provisions of section 12 of P.L.1966, c.30
(C.54:32B-12).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   The seller shall pay the
amount of tax due on the retail sale or service receipt, as determined pursuant
to section 4 of P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-4), as trustee for and on account of
the State, and shall have the same liability for that amount of tax pursuant to
the &quot;Sales and Use Tax Act,&quot; P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.), as
for an amount collected from a customer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (g)   No person required to
collect any tax imposed by this act shall be held liable for having charged and
collected the incorrect amount of sales and use tax by reason of reliance on
erroneous data provided by the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries
or taxing jurisdiction assignments or contained in the taxability matrix.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (h)   In connection with a
purchaser's request from a seller of over-collected sales or use taxes, a
seller shall be presumed to have a reasonable business practice, if in the
collection of such sales or use taxes, the seller: (1) uses either a provider
or a system, including a proprietary system, that is certified by the State;
and (2) has remitted to the State all taxes collected less any deductions,
credits, or collection allowances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (i)    No purchaser shall be
held liable for any tax, interest or penalty for failure to pay the correct
amount of tax by reason of:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the reliance of the
purchaser's seller or certified service provider on erroneous data provided by
the director with respect to tax rates, boundaries or taxing jurisdiction
assignments or contained in the taxability matrix;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the reliance of the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  a. Simultaneously with
the starting date for the implementation of retail choice as determined by the
board pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-53), the
board shall permit each electric public utility and gas public utility to
recover some or all of the following costs through a societal benefits charge
that shall be collected as a non-bypassable charge imposed on all electric
public utility customers and gas public utility customers, as appropriate:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) The costs for the social
programs for which rate recovery was approved by the board prior to April 30,
1997.  For the purpose of establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be
set to recover the same level of social program costs as is being collected in
the bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  The board may subsequently order, pursuant
to its rules and regulations, an increase or decrease in the societal benefits
charge to reflect changes in the costs to the utility of administering existing
social programs.  Nothing in P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) shall be
construed to abolish or change any social program required by statute or board
order or rule or regulation to be provided by an electric public utility.  Any
such social program shall continue to be provided by the utility until
otherwise provided by law, unless the board determines that it is no longer
appropriate for the electric public utility to provide the program, or the
board chooses to modify the program;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) Nuclear plant
decommissioning costs;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) The costs of demand side
management programs that were approved by the board pursuant to its demand side
management regulations prior to April 30, 1997.  For the purpose of
establishing initial unbundled rates pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-52), the societal benefits charge shall be set to recover the same
level of demand side management program costs as is being collected in the
bundled rates of the electric public utility on the effective date of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.).  Within four months of the effective date of P.L.1999,
c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and every four years thereafter, the board shall
initiate a proceeding and cause to be undertaken a comprehensive resource
analysis of energy programs, and within eight months of initiating such
proceeding and after notice, provision of the opportunity for public comment,
and public hearing, the board, in consultation with the Department of
Environmental Protection, shall determine the appropriate level of funding for
energy efficiency, light, medium, and heavy-duty plug-in electric vehicles,
including school buses, and associated plug-in electric vehicle charging
infrastructure, and Class I renewable energy programs that provide
environmental benefits above and beyond those provided by standard offer or
similar programs in effect as of the effective date of P.L.1999, c.23
(C.48:3-49 et al.); provided that the funding for such programs be no less than
50 percent of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas
public utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date
of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.) for an initial period of four years from
the issuance of the first comprehensive resource analysis following the
effective date of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), and provided that 25
percent of this amount shall be used to provide funding for Class I renewable
energy projects in the State.  In each of the following fifth through eighth
years, the Statewide funding for such programs shall be no less than 50 percent
of the total Statewide amount being collected in electric and gas public
utility rates for demand side management programs on the effective date of
P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-49 et al.), except that as additional funds are made
available as a result of the expiration of past standard offer or similar
commitments, the minimum amount of funding for such programs shall increase by
an additional amount equal to 50 percent of the additional funds made
available, until the minimum amount of funding dedicated to such programs
reaches $140,000,000 total.  After the eighth year the board shall make a determination
as to the appropriate level of funding for these programs.  Such programs shall
include a program to provide financial incentives for the installation of Class
I renewable energy projects in the State, and the board, in consultation with
the Department of Environmental Protection, shall determine the level and total
amount of such incentives as well as the renewable technologies eligible for
such incentives which shall include, at a minimum, photovoltaic, wind, and fuel
cells.  The board shall simultaneously determine, as a result of the
comprehensive resource analysis, the programs to be funded by the societal
benefits charge, the level of cost recovery and performance incentives for old
and new programs and whether the recovery of demand side management programs'
costs currently approved by the board may be reduced or extended over a longer
period of time.  The board shall make these determinations taking into
consideration existing market barriers and environmental benefits, with the
objective of transforming markets, capturing lost opportunities, making energy
services more affordable for low income customers and eliminating subsidies for
programs that can be delivered in the marketplace without electric public
utility and gas public utility customer funding;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5) The cost, of consumer
education, as determined by the board, which shall be in an amount that,
together with the consumer education surcharge imposed on electric power
supplier license fees pursuant to subsection h. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.23
<br>
(C.48:3-78) and the consumer education surcharge imposed on gas supplier
license fees pursuant to subsection g. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.23
