The municipal engineer shall certify to the following in regard to the designated site in which a stop intersection is being designated: (i) that both intersecting streets are under municipal jurisdiction; (ii) that the intersection is within 500 feet of a school, playground, or youth recreational facility as defined herein; and (iii) that the intersection is on a street contiguous to a school, playground, or youth recreational facility.  A claim against a municipality for damage or injury under this subparagraph for a wrongful act or omission shall be dismissed if the municipality is deemed to have conformed to the provisions contained in this subparagraph. (2)   Ordinance or resolution: a.     Designating through streets, as provided in article 17 of this chapter (R.S.39:4-140 et seq.); and b.    Designating and providing for the maintenance as "no passing" zones of portions of highway where overtaking and passing or driving to the left of the roadway is deemed especially hazardous.

Any person parking a motor vehicle in a restricted parking space without a special vehicle identification card shall be liable to a fine of $250 for the first offense and, for subsequent offenses, a fine of at least $250 and up to 90 days' community service on such terms and in such form as the court shall deem appropriate, or any combination thereof; and d.    Designating a special event zone pursuant to section 1 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2008, c.110, s.2) 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill permits the designation of special event zones for the purpose of regulating traffic during certain special events, which the bill defines as any automotive or motor vehicle events occurring on or near a roadway, which events either have been approved by the county or municipality in which the event is located, or are expected to have 25 or more persons in attendance. When a special event occurs, or is expected to occur, on any roadway under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation (DOT), the bill permits the Commissioner of Transportation to designate all or part of the roadway, including any parking structures or other property located within the designated area, as a special event zone.  Similarly, when a special event occurs, or is expected to occur, on a roadway under the jurisdiction of a county or municipality, the county or municipality may also designate the area as a special event zone.  In either case, the special event zone would remain in effect for the duration of the special event, and including a reasonable period of time before and after the special event.  While the special event zone remains in effect, the DOT, municipality, or county, as applicable, would be required to maintain appropriate signage on or along the special event zone. Under the bill, certain traffic regulations would be altered within the special event zone while the zone remains in effect, including: (1) an allowance for the DOT, county, or municipality, as applicable, to reduce the established speed limitations, as such reductions are deemed necessary to ensure public safety; and (2) the prohibition of exhibition driving, which the bill defines to include certain forms of disruptive or erratic driving; and (3) the imposition of increased penalties for certain traffic offenses. Specifically, the bill provides that a person would be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000 after committing the following traffic offenses within a special event zone: (1) operating a motor vehicle in excess of the posted speed limitation; (2) careless driving; and (3) operating a motor vehicle for a wager, in a race, or for the purposes of making a speed record.  Additionally, a person who engages in exhibition driving or reckless driving within a special event zone would be subject to a fine not exceeding $1,000, a term of imprisonment of up to 60 days, or both. Under current law, the Commissioner of Transportation is required to approve certain types of local traffic regulations before those regulations may take effect.  Under the bill, the designation of a special event zone by a county or municipal would take effect without requiring the approval of the commissioner.
