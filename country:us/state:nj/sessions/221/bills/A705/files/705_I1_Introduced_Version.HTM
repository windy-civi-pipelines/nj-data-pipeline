<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> </span>concerning the deferral of certain senior
citizens property tax payments, and supplementing Title 54 of the Revised
Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known
and may be cited as the &quot;Senior Citizens Property Tax Deferral Act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The combination of low,
fixed incomes, and New Jerseys high cost of living, have created an overwhelming
challenge for many New Jersey seniors, over 42 percent of whom live in economic
insecurity;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Property taxes in New
Jersey have risen dramatically in recent years, climbing on average from less
than $5,000 in 2002, at which time the States property taxes were already
highest in the nation by some measures, to more than $8,500 in recent years;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Many New Jersey
seniors, in addition to struggling with low fixed incomes, frequently face
health emergencies and other problems that may render them unable to handle
financial matters, or may turn the payment of property taxes into a financially
impossible task; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Because property tax
bills, if neglected for long enough, can result in a tax sale, and eventually
foreclosure, these bills threaten many seniors with financial catastrophe and
the eventual loss of home ownership;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Despite the recent
improvements in unemployment statistics and other economic indicators, New
Jerseys foreclosure rate continues to be elevated, and was higher than that of
any other state in 2018;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Although reverse
mortgages, in some cases, can offer seniors the extra money necessary to pay
property tax bills, seniors are often reluctant to enter into these contracts,
due to concerns that fees and other contractual terms may become more
burdensome than initially expected; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    It is, therefore, a
compelling public purpose in the best interests of this State to allow certain
low-income seniors defer the payment of property taxes until a senior dies, or
the home is sold or otherwise conveyed.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    As used in P.L.    ,
c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Applicant&quot; means an
eligible senior who submits an application for a tax deferral.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Deferral&quot; or &quot;tax
deferral&quot; means the delay of bill payment for property taxes pursuant to
section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Deferred payments&quot;
means taxes subject to a deferral.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Director&quot; means the
Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Eligible senior&quot;
means any person of at least 65 years of age whose residence has an equalized
assessed value of under $500,000, is not subject to a reverse mortgage, and who
has an annual household income, for federal income tax purposes, of less than
$50,000.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Eligible seniors equity&quot;
means 75 percent of the equalized assessed value of the residence as determined
by the municipal assessor for the year in which the eligible senior files a
claim under section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the
Legislature as this bill), which amount shall be reduced by the amount of any
liens against the residence, including the liens for any property taxes already
deferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Residence&quot; means a
dwelling unit that is occupied by the owner as their principal place of
domicile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Reverse mortgage&quot;
means a home equity conversion mortgage or other similar financial instrument
marketed as a reverse mortgage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Senior Citizens Property
Tax Deferral Fund&quot; means the revolving fund established pursuant to
section 13 of
P.L.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending
before the Legislature as this bill).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Tax-deferred property&quot;
means the land and residential improvements thereon upon which property taxes
are deferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    a.  An eligible senior
may apply for an annual deferral of the amount of all property taxes that will

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows New
  Jersey seniors, 65 years of age and older, whose annual household income, for
federal tax purposes, is under $50,000 to also qualify for an annual deferral
of property tax payments.  Deferral eligibility is further limited to persons
whose primary residence does not have a reverse mortgage, and has a value of
under $500,000.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A senior eligible for a
deferral, or a person acting on behalf of the senior, would file an application
with the tax collector of the municipality in which the residence is located by
April 1 of the year preceding the tax year that the deferral would cover, and
submit any documentation required to ascertain that the applicant qualifies for
the deferral.  The amount of an annual deferral cannot exceed 110 percent of
the taxes assessed and levied on the residence for the preceding year, as
adjusted to incorporate any rebates, credits, deductions, or exemptions that
are not received later, but incorporated into the property tax bill itself. 
Deferral payments will not be permitted beyond 75 percent of a homes equity. 
Receipt of a deferral will not limit the amount that may later be received
through the homestead property tax reimbursement program, P.L.1997, c.348
(C.54:4-8.67 et al.).  Interest will accrue on deferred payments at a rate of
nine percent, which is one half of the maximum rate permissible for delinquent
taxes pursuant to R.S.54:4-67.  However, the Director of the Division of
Taxation will have discretion to annually alter this rate by as much as four
percentage points higher or lower in response to mortgage rate trends.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Deferral payments shall become
due upon the death of the senior, the conveyance of the property, upon entrance
into any reverse mortgage agreement, or if the home ceases to be the primary
residence of the eligible senior for reasons other than health complications. 
A spouse of a deceased senior of age 55 or older will be able to continue the
propertys deferred status, subject to the 75 percent equity limit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to avoid an unfunded
mandate, this bill requires that the State annually pay each municipality for
the deferrals that eligible senior residents have applied for.  The tax
collector is required to reimburse the State, including all interest accrued
for each deferral, upon receipt of the payment deferred from each eligible
senior.  At the time of this return payment, the tax collectors office is
permitted to keep up to $25 per annual deferral granted, in order to account
for any administrative costs incurred.  In other words, if a senior receives a
deferral each year for four years, the tax collector would be entitled to keep
as much as $100 in administrative expenses when that deferral is fully repaid
to the State.  Refund payments to the State shall be deposited into the &quot;Senior
Citizens Property Tax Deferral Fund,&quot; a revolving fund to be established
in the Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the State limits the amount
of funding dedicated to property tax deferral reimbursement payments for any
year through the annual appropriations act, and revolving fund monies are
insufficient for all applications, then the amount annually paid from the State
to each municipality will be allocated proportionally to the amount that
eligible seniors within each municipality have applied and qualified for.  Each
municipal tax collector would then award tax deferrals to seniors with priority
going first to those who received a deferral in the previous year, and next to
the earliest applications.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Misrepresenting eligibility
could constitute a crime of the fourth degree, or a disorderly persons offense,
depending on whether the misrepresentation was intentional or only negligent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill directs the Division
of Taxation to adopt regulations to implement the program, and biennially
report on the utilization of the program.</p>
