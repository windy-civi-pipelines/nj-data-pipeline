(2)   The mortgage servicer shall submit information on all forbearances that the mortgage servicer has provided within the State to the Department of Banking and Insurance on a monthly basis, or on any alternative schedule directed by the Department of Banking and Insurance, after removing all personally identifiable information.  This information shall be submitted in accordance with any specifications required by the Department of Banking and Insurance, and, to the extent required by the Department of Banking and Insurance, shall be deemed to be government records and subject to the provisions of P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the Open Public Records Act. i.     This section shall not apply to any mortgage loans made, insured, or securitized by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the Federal Housing Administration of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the Rural Housing Service, nor shall this section apply to any mortgage loans serviced pursuant to the policies of these entities but not made, or insured, or securitized by the entities unless the mortgage loan has been granted a forbearance pursuant to this section prior to being serviced by these entities. j.     It shall be an unlawful discrimination in violation of the "New Jersey Law Against Discrimination," P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) for a mortgage servicer to discriminate in application of the provisions of this section on any basis protected by subsection g. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12). 3.    A storm-impacted homeowner who is the subject of a foreclosure proceeding shall be awarded, by the court and upon application by the property owner for good cause shown, a stay in the foreclosure proceedings.  An application to the court by a storm-impacted homeowner pursuant to this section shall be made prior to the first day of the sixth month next following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), unless the courts in their discretion permit application submission for a longer period. The receipt of a Certification of Eligibility for Forbearance, issued to the storm-impacted homeowner pursuant to section 2 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall constitute good cause for the award of a stay pursuant to this subsection.  The award of a stay pursuant to this section shall conclude upon the earlier of: a.     the conclusion of one year following the initial award of a stay of foreclosure proceedings; or b.    January 1, 2026. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would provide mortgage payment relief and foreclosure protection for certain homeowners impacted by the remnants of Hurricane Ida. Hurricane Ida initially approached the Gulf Coast as a category 4 hurricane, and caused severe damage to a large area of the south and northeast regions of the country.  In New Jersey, thousands of families have been displaced and unable to return to their homes as a result of this storm.  This bill would offer certain homeowners impacted by the remnants of Hurricane Ida temporary protections against foreclosure, and would require mortgage servicers to provide a temporary pause in the mortgage payment obligations of the storm-impacted homeowners. The bill defines a "storm-impacted homeowner" as a mortgagor who, as of August 31, 2021, occupied the residential property as their primary residence and received federal disaster assistance for needs related to damage sustained from the remnants of Hurricane Ida. The bill permits eligible homeowners, meeting the requirements set forth in the bill, to apply to the Department of Community Affairs (department) for Certifications of Eligibility for Forbearance online through a system established by the department no later than 30 days after the date the department makes the application publicly available.  The department would be required to review each application to determine whether the applicant meets eligibility criteria demonstrating their need for assistance, and if they do, issue a Certification of Eligibility for Forbearance to the applicant, which would entitle the applicant to receive a one-year mortgage forbearance from their mortgage servicer.  Any homeowner who is denied a Certification of Eligibility for Forbearance may appeal that decision, and any homeowner who obtains a Certification of Eligibility for Forbearance but is denied a forbearance from a mortgage servicer licensed by the Department of Banking and Insurance may file a complaint with that agency, which must investigate, and if appropriate, order the mortgage servicer to grant a forbearance. The bill requires that, during forbearance, and during the subsequent time period constituting an extension of the mortgage, all terms and conditions of the original mortgage, except with regard to default and delinquency during forbearance, are to continue without modification, fees assessed, late penalties, or penalties for early repayment.  The bill also requires a mortgage servicer to: submit certain information, as specified in the bill, related to any pending actions involving property granted a forbearance to the Superior Court Clerks Office; and, on a monthly basis, submit certain information on all forbearances that the mortgage servicer has provided within the State to the Department of Banking and Insurance, except as provided in the bill. Further, a storm-impacted homeowner who is the subject of a foreclosure proceeding would be awarded, by the court and upon application by the property owner for good cause shown, a stay in the foreclosure proceedings.  An application to the court by a storm-impacted homeowner would be required to be made prior to the first day of the sixth month following the effective date of the bill, unless the courts in their discretion permit application submission for a longer period.  The award of a stay pursuant to the bill would conclude upon the earlier of:       the conclusion of one year following the initial award of a stay of foreclosure proceedings; or       January 1, 2026.
