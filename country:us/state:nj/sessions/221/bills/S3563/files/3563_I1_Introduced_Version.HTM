<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes the New
Jersey Board of Paramedicine.  Current law governing mobile intensive care
paramedics and emergency medical technicians are repealed and the board is
assigned oversight of these professions, in addition to mobile intensive care
nurses, flight paramedics, and flight nurses.  Paramedicine is defined in the
bill to mean the practice of basic life support and advanced life support. 
Basic life support or basic life support services means, in the bill, a
basic level of pre-hospital care which includes the use of procedures,
medications, and equipment established by the National EMS Scope of Practice
Model from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and other
techniques, therapies, and procedures authorized by the board.  Advanced life
support is defined, under the bill, to mean an advanced level of emergency
medical care, including specialty care transport and air medical ambulances,
which includes the use of procedures, medications, and equipment established by
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's National EMS Scope of
Practice Model for paramedics, and any other such procedures, therapies,
medications, and as otherwise authorized in rules or regulations promulgated by
the board.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board is to consist of 15
members to include: (1) five actively practicing as New Jersey-licensed mobile
intensive care paramedics; (2) three New Jersey-licensed emergency medical
technicians; one of whom is to be a board-certified emergency medical services
physician; (3) one board-certified trauma surgeon; (4) one board-certified
pediatric emergency medicine physician; (5) one representative from the New
Jersey Emergency Nurses Association; and (6) three public members.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill authorizes the board
to, among other items: (1) prescribe standards and requirements for individuals
seeking licensure as a mobile intensive care paramedic, mobile intensive care
nurse, flight paramedic, flight nurse, or emergency medical technician; (2)
establish standards for and accredit schools to train individuals overseen by the
new board; (3) develop a registry of all individuals who have successfully
completed training and a competency evaluation program; (4) conduct
investigations and research to determine if new information will help advance
the profession of paramedicine; and (5) establish an Alternative to Discipline
Program for licensees dealing with a chemical dependency or other impairment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes two
separate funds  one a Board of Paramedicine Fund to, in part, fund research
related to paramedicine and support operations of the board and the other an
Emergency Medical Technician Training Fund to assist certain individuals
training to be an emergency medical technician.  The bill also creates an
Emergency Medical Services for Children Advisory Council to advise the board
on emergency medical services for minors.  The bill also updates current laws
to reflect the changes regarding the creation of the board.</p>
