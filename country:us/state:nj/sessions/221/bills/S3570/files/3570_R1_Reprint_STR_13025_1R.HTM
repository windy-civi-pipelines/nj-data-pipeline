R.S.39:3-10 is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     39:3-10.  a. A person shall
not drive a motor vehicle on a public highway in this State unless the person
is under supervision while participating in a behind-the-wheel driving course
pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1977, c.25 (C.39:3-13.2a) or is in possession of a
validated permit, or a probationary or basic driver's license issued to that
person in accordance with this article.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A person under 18 years
of age shall not be issued a basic license to drive motor vehicles, and a
person shall not be issued a validated permit, including a validated
examination permit, until the applicant has passed a satisfactory examination
and other requirements as to the applicant's ability as an operator.  The examination
shall include:  a test of the applicant's vision; the applicant's ability to
understand traffic control devices; the applicant's knowledge of safe driving
practices, including the dangers of driving a vehicle in an aggressive manner,
which shall include, but not be limited to, unexpectedly altering the speed of
a vehicle, making improper or erratic traffic lane changes, disregarding
traffic control devices, failing to yield the right of way, and following
another vehicle too closely; the applicant's knowledge of operating a motor
vehicle in a manner that safely shares the roadway with pedestrians, cyclists,
skaters, riders of motorized-scooters, and other non-motorized vehicles, which
shall include, but not be limited to, passing a cyclist on the roadway,
recognizing bicycle lanes, navigating intersections with pedestrians and
cyclists, and exiting a vehicle without endangering pedestrians and cyclists;
the applicant's knowledge of the effects that ingestion of alcohol or drugs has
on a person's ability to operate a motor vehicle; the applicant's knowledge of
the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning from motor vehicles and techniques for
the safe operation and proper maintenance of a motor vehicle; the applicant's
knowledge of portions of the mechanism of motor vehicles as is necessary to
insure the safe operation of a vehicle of the kind or kinds indicated by the
applicant; and the applicant's knowledge of the laws and ordinary usages of the
road.  The examination shall be made available in English and each of the three
languages, other than English, most commonly spoken in the State, as determined
by the chief administrator.  The chief administrator shall periodically, and at
least every five years, verify the three languages, other than English, most commonly
spoken in the State. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     A person shall not sit
for an examination for any permit without exhibiting photo identification
deemed acceptable by the commission, unless that person is a high school
student participating in a course of automobile driving education approved by
the State Department of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or
private school of this State, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127
(C.39:3-13.1). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Prior to taking an examination
for any permit, a person shall watch a video created by the commission, in
conjunction with the Attorney General, explaining the rights and
responsibilities of a driver stopped by a law enforcement officer.  The video
shall be used for informational purposes only and shall not be used in any
criminal proceeding involving a driver stopped by a law enforcement officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission may waive the
written law knowledge examination for any person 18 years of age or older
possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other state, the District of
Columbia, or the United States Territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands.  The commission shall be
required to provide that person with a booklet that highlights those motor
vehicle laws unique to New Jersey.  A road test shall be required for a
probationary license and serve as a demonstration of the applicant's ability to
operate a vehicle of the class designated.  During the road test, an applicant
may use a rear visibility system, parking sensors, or other technology
installed on the motor vehicle that enables the applicant to view areas
directly behind the vehicle or alerts the applicant of obstacles while parking.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A person shall not sit
for a road test unless that person exhibits photo identification deemed
acceptable by the commission.  A high school student who has completed a course
of behind-the-wheel automobile driving education approved by the State
Department of Education and conducted in a public, parochial, or private school
of this State, who has been issued a special learner's permit pursuant to
section 1 of P.L.1950, c.127 (C.39:3-13.1) prior to January 1, 2003, shall not
be required to exhibit photo identification in order to sit for a road test. 
The commission may waive the road test for any person 18 years of age or older
possessing a valid driver's license issued by any other state, the District of
