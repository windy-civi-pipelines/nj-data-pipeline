Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) a.  There
is established, in the Department of Agriculture, the Farmland Assessment
Review Commission, the purpose of which shall be to regularly review, and to recommend
and facilitate the regular and appropriate updating of, the States farmland
assessment program, as well as the rules and regulations adopted for the programs
purposes, in order to promote and ensure, on a Statewide basis, across all
local jurisdictions and regardless of implementing agency, office, or official,
the consistent, accurate, reliable, and uniform application and enforcement of,
and ongoing site compliance with, existing farmland assessment program
requirements, as necessary to ensure the continued fair and equitable Statewide
allocation and distribution of program benefits to and among all sites, and
only those sites, that continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements
therefor, consistent with the requirements of Article VIII, Section I,
paragraph 1(b) of the State Constitution, as amended, and the provisions of the
Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), as
amended and supplemented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
have the duty to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   evaluate and delineate
the reasons why, as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        )
(pending before the Legislature as this bill), more than 37,000 properties are
subject to farmland assessment in New Jersey; annually identify the current
number, size, and location of all properties that are subject to farmland
assessment in the State, as well as the total amount of farmland-assessed land,
by acreage and percentage of all lands, lying within the jurisdictions of each
county and municipality in the State; determine the rate at which the total number
of farmland-assessed sites has increased, on a year-over-year basis, and by
county and municipality, since the farmland assessment programs inception, and
the rate at which such total number of farmland-assessed sites is expected to continue
to increase, on a year-over-year basis, and by county and municipality, in
future years of program operation; evaluate whether, and the extent to which,
it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to impose conditions or
restrictions that are designed to limit either the total value of benefits being
annually allocated to farmland-assessed properties or the total number of
properties annually entitled to receive such benefits, or to limit, by number
or size, the types of properties that may be deemed newly <br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>eligible for farmland assessment benefits
in each upcoming tax year; and, to the extent that the commission deems it
feasible and appropriate to impose any such limits on total farmland assessment
participation rates or benefits levels, or both, develop recommendations regarding
the appropriate conditions or restrictions to be imposed for such purposes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   evaluate whether, and
the extent to which, there is a need to establish, or to continue using, a
dedicated source of State funding to facilitate the annual undertaking of local
on-site inspections at all farmland-assessed sites in the State, as necessary
to confirm each sites ongoing eligibility for continued program benefits, and whether,
and the extent to which, it would be possible to cover the costs of such local
on-site inspections by requiring the owners or operators of farmland-assessed
sites to annually pay a mandatory inspection fee to be dedicated and used for
such purposes; and, to the extent that such fee-based inspection system is
deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations designed to
facilitate the establishment and the effective and efficient operation of such
system in New Jersey, including, but not limited to, recommendations as to
whether such system would be most effectively operated and administered by the State
government, by local governments, or by both the State and local governments
acting in coordination, recommendations regarding the minimum and maximum fee amounts
to be imposed on farmland-assessed sites to ensure and facilitate the annual
collection and dedication of funding sufficient to cover the requisite costs of
all such on-site inspections, and recommendations as to whether, and the extent
to which, the fee requirements imposed on site owners or operators, for the
purposes of such fee-based funding system, should vary by municipality, or
based on site size, site-related income, or other site-related factors, as
necessary to ensure ongoing fairness and equitability in association with the
Statewide implementation of such fee-based funding system;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   evaluate whether, and
the extent to which, the continuance, from one tax year to the next, of tax
benefits previously allocated to a farmland-assessed site, as authorized pursuant
to section 15 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.15) and section 1 of P.L.1971, c.400
(C.54:4-23.15a), is currently conditioned or is otherwise dependent upon the site
owner or operators submission of site-related farm product sales data, and whether,
and the extent to which, farmland assessment benefits authorized to be continued
in an upcoming tax year may differ, in level or amount, from the benefits previously

most recently reported farm product sales data; and, to the extent the
commission deems it to be appropriate and necessary, develop recommendations for

regulations, procedures, protocols, and standards that could be implemented, by
the Governor, by the Legislature, by the Department of Agriculture or the State
Board of Agriculture, by local government units or local tax assessors, or by
other relevant actors or entities, to facilitate and ensure greater levels of fairness
and equitability in association with the year-to-year continuance of previously
authorized farmland assessment benefits in the State, including, but not
limited to, recommendations regarding the need for, and the feasibility and
benefits of adopting, new or revised Statewide procedures that would expressly
condition the continuance of benefits upon continued site eligibility therefor,

reflect, and to be commensurate with, each such eligible sites most recently
reported farm product sales data; </p>

to, recommendations regarding the maximum amount of annual household income, or
the maximum amount of annual farm income, which a site owner or operator should
be authorized to claim before being deemed ineligible for farmland assessment
benefits in any given year, recommendations regarding whether, and the extent
to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to provide for farmland
assessment benefits to vary by site-related income bracket, and, if such
income-based variation is deemed to be feasible and appropriate,
recommendations regarding the manner in which benefits should be variably allocated,
to site owners or operators in each eligible income bracket below the maximum income
eligibility cap recommended pursuant to this paragraph, as necessary to ensure the

assessment eligibility determinations in the State; evaluate whether, and the
extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to require such
standards and guidelines to be updated on an annual or other regular basis;
and, if such regular updating is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop
recommendations regarding the preferred rate at which such updates should be
made and setting forth simplified and clarified language and new or revised eligibility
test criteria to be incorporated into the updated standards and guidelines, as
necessary to facilitate and maximize consistency and Statewide uniformity in program
eligibility determinations, and fairness and equitability in the valuation of

definitions regarding what it means for a site to be:  (a) devoted to the
production for sale of plants and animals useful to man, as necessary for the
site to be deemed in agricultural use, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1964,

agreement with an agency of the Federal Government, as necessary for the site to
be deemed in horticultural use, pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1964, c.48
(C.54:4-23.4); and (c) actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use,
as necessary for the site to be deemed annually eligible for farmland

adopt new legislation, as necessary and appropriate to implement, or to legislatively
authorize the implementation of, any commission-recommended program changes of
which the Legislature approves.  Any recommendations that are included in a
commission report, but which have not yet been incorporated into, or otherwise
expressly addressed in, legislation adopted pursuant to the bill, would be
deemed to be unapproved for implementation at the present time; however,
nothing in the bills provisions would be deemed to prohibit the Legislature
from approving and adopting any such previously unapproved recommendations, at
a later time, through the enactment of new legislation pursuant to, and as
provided by, the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Whenever a commission report includes
a recommendation advocating for the regular review or the specific updating of
guidelines that are required to be developed, pursuant to section 1 of
P.L.2013, c.43 (C.54:4-23.3d), for the purposes of the States farmland
assessment program, the bill would require the State Agriculture Development
Committee and the Department of Agriculture to cooperatively develop and
implement relevant rules, regulations, procedures, and protocols, as
appropriate, to facilitate the regular and ongoing review thereby of such
guidelines, at intervals recommended by the commission and approved by the
Legislature pursuant to the bill, or to facilitate the timely revision and
updating of such guidelines, as necessary to incorporate any
commission-recommended definitional or language changes or other substantive
revisions or updates which have been approved by the Legislature pursuant to the
bill, or both.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commission established by
this bill is intended, by the sponsor, to provide a formal mechanism and means
by which the State can better ensure and facilitate the ongoing review and
updating of all relevant State laws, rules, regulations, procedures, protocols,
standards, and guidelines which are used in, or which are or may be impacting,
the States farmland assessment program and the allocation of farmland
assessment benefits thereunder.  Although the sponsor agrees with the premise
of keeping New Jersey lands protected from overdevelopment, it is the sponsors
hope and intention that this bill, by facilitating the ongoing
commission-initiated review and legislatively approved revision of farmland
assessment program requirements, will serve to improve and facilitate clarity,
certainty, equitability, and uniformity, both in the Statewide application and
enforcement of farmland assessment program requirements and in the allocation and
distribution of farmland assessment tax benefits, thereby resulting in a
greater sense of fairness, among all taxpayers, in association with the implementation
of the States farmland assessment program and the distribution of tax benefits
thereunder.</p>
