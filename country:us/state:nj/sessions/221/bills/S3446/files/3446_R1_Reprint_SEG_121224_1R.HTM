BUCCO District 25 (Morris and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Turner and Cryan SYNOPSIS Establishes Farmland Assessment Review Commission to annually review and recommend changes to farmland assessment program, as necessary to ensure fair, equitable, and uniform Statewide application and enforcement of program requirements and allocation of program benefits. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As reported by the Senate Economic Growth Committee on December 12, 2024, with amendments. An Act concerning farmland assessment, supplementing Title 54 of the Revised Statutes, and amending P.L.2013, c.43. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.   (New section) a.  There is established, in the Department of Agriculture, the Farmland Assessment Review Commission, the purpose of which shall be to regularly review, and to recommend and facilitate the regular and appropriate updating of, the States farmland assessment program, as well as the rules and regulations adopted for the programs purposes, in order to promote and ensure, on a Statewide basis, across all local jurisdictions and regardless of implementing agency, office, or official, the consistent, accurate, reliable, and uniform application and enforcement of, and ongoing site compliance with, existing farmland assessment program requirements, as necessary to ensure the continued fair and equitable Statewide allocation and distribution of program benefits to and among all sites, and only those sites, that continue to satisfy the eligibility requirements therefor, consistent with the requirements of Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 1(b) of the State Constitution, as amended, and the provisions of the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964, P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented. b.    The commission shall have the duty to: (1)   evaluate and delineate the reasons why, as of the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), more than 37,000 properties are subject to farmland assessment in New Jersey; annually identify the current number, size, and location of all properties that are subject to farmland assessment in the State, as well as the total amount of farmland-assessed land, by acreage and percentage of all lands, lying within the jurisdictions of each county and municipality in the State; determine the rate at which the total number of farmland-assessed sites has increased, on a year-over-year basis, and by county and municipality, since the farmland assessment programs inception, and the rate at which such total number of farmland-assessed sites is expected to continue to increase, on a year-over-year basis, and by county and municipality, in future years of program operation; evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to impose conditions or restrictions that are designed to limit either the total value of benefits being annually allocated to farmland-assessed properties or the total number of properties annually entitled to receive such benefits, or to limit, by number or size, the types of properties that may be deemed newly eligible for farmland assessment benefits in each upcoming tax year; and, to the extent that the commission deems it feasible and appropriate to impose any such limits on total farmland assessment participation rates or benefits levels, or both, develop recommendations regarding the appropriate conditions or restrictions to be imposed for such purposes; (2)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, there is a need to establish, or to continue using, a dedicated source of State funding to facilitate the annual undertaking of local on-site inspections at all farmland-assessed sites in the State, as necessary to confirm each sites ongoing eligibility for continued program benefits, and whether, and the extent to which, it would be possible to cover the costs of such local on-site inspections by requiring the owners or operators of farmland-assessed sites to annually pay a mandatory inspection fee to be dedicated and used for such purposes; and, to the extent that such fee-based inspection system is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations designed to facilitate the establishment and the effective and efficient operation of such system in New Jersey, including, but not limited to, recommendations as to whether such system would be most effectively operated and administered by the State government, by local governments, or by both the State and local governments acting in coordination, recommendations regarding the minimum and maximum fee amounts to be imposed on farmland-assessed sites to ensure and facilitate the annual collection and dedication of funding sufficient to cover the requisite costs of all such on-site inspections, and recommendations as to whether, and the extent to which, the fee requirements imposed on site owners or operators, for the purposes of such fee-based funding system, should vary by municipality, or based on site size, site-related income, or other site-related factors, as necessary to ensure ongoing fairness and equitability in association with the Statewide implementation of such fee-based funding system; (3)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, the continuance, from one tax year to the next, of tax benefits previously allocated to a farmland-assessed site, as authorized pursuant to section 15 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.15) and section 1 of P.L.1971, c.400 (C.54:4-23.15a), is currently conditioned or is otherwise dependent upon the site owner or operators submission of site-related farm product sales data, and whether, and the extent to which, farmland assessment benefits authorized to be continued in an upcoming tax year may differ, in level or amount, from the benefits previously allocated to a farmland-assessed site, based on, and commensurate with, the sites most recently reported farm product sales data; and, to the extent the commission deems it to be appropriate and necessary, develop recommendations for actions that could be undertaken, or for new or revised laws, rules, regulations, procedures, protocols, and standards that could be implemented, by the Governor, by the Legislature, by the Department of Agriculture or the State Board of Agriculture, by local government units or local tax assessors, or by other relevant actors or entities, to facilitate and ensure greater levels of fairness and equitability in association with the year-to-year continuance of previously authorized farmland assessment benefits in the State, including, but not limited to, recommendations regarding the need for, and the feasibility and benefits of adopting, new or revised Statewide procedures that would expressly condition the continuance of benefits upon continued site eligibility therefor, and that would further require the amount of any such continued benefits to reflect, and to be commensurate with, each such eligible sites most recently reported farm product sales data; (4)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to establish new, means-tested farmland assessment eligibility requirements, and, if such action is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations to facilitate the implementation of such requirements, including, but not limited to, recommendations regarding the maximum amount of annual household income, or the maximum amount of annual farm income, which a site owner or operator should be authorized to claim before being deemed ineligible for farmland assessment benefits in any given year, recommendations regarding whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to provide for farmland assessment benefits to vary by site-related income bracket, and, if such income-based variation is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, recommendations regarding the manner in which benefits should be variably allocated, to site owners or operators in each eligible income bracket below the maximum income eligibility cap recommended pursuant to this paragraph, as necessary to ensure the fair and equitable allocation of annually available program benefits to each farmland-assessed site, commensurate with annual site-related income; (5)   review the standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.43 (C.54:4-23.3d), or pursuant to any other law, rule, or regulation, which are used to facilitate farmland assessment eligibility determinations in the State; evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to require such standards and guidelines to be updated on an annual or other regular basis; and, if such regular updating is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations regarding the preferred rate at which such updates should be made and setting forth simplified and clarified language and new or revised eligibility test criteria to be incorporated into the updated standards and guidelines, as necessary to facilitate and maximize consistency and Statewide uniformity in program eligibility determinations, and fairness and equitability in the valuation of program benefits annually allocated to eligible sites.  In developing initial recommendations for language changes pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall include, at a minimum, suggestions designed to facilitate the implementation and use, pursuant to such standards and guidelines, of clearer and more concise definitions regarding what it means for a site to be:  (a) devoted to the production for sale of plants and animals useful to man, as necessary for the site to be deemed in agricultural use, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.3); (b) devoted to the production for sale of fruits of all kinds or devoted to and meeting the requirements and qualifications for payments or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the Federal Government, as necessary for the site to be deemed in horticultural use, pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.4); and (c) actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use, as necessary for the site to be deemed annually eligible for farmland assessment benefits, pursuant to sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.2, C.54:4-23.5, C.54:4-23.6, C.54:4-23.7, and C.54:4-23.11); (6)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, the implementation of the Pinelands Protection Act, P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et seq.), the States Green Acres, Blue Acres, and historic preservation programs, established pursuant to the Garden State Preservation Trust Act, P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) and the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), the States forest stewardship plans and program, established pursuant to P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-29 et seq.), and any other plans, programs, or laws relating to the acquisition, preservation, stewardship, management, or maintenance of open spaces, green spaces, historic spaces, forested or woodland spaces, or other non-farmland spaces in the State, whether implemented or administered by the State, by individual counties or municipalities therein, or cooperatively, by both State and local government officials, are functioning, in practice, in a manner that serves to reduce, hinder, or otherwise restrict the fair, equitable, and uniform Statewide application and enforcement of farmland assessment program requirements, or the fair and equitable allocation and distribution of farmland assessment program benefits on a Statewide basis; and develop recommendations regarding the actions that could be undertaken by the Governor, by the Legislature, by the Department of Agriculture or the State Board of Agriculture, by local government units or local tax assessors, or by other relevant actors or entities, and the other available means and methods that could be utilized in the State, to:  (a) reduce, eliminate, or prevent any such negative effects on the farmland assessment program which have resulted, or which may result, from the implementation of any such plans, laws, or programs relating to the preservation, stewardship, management, or ongoing use of open spaces, green spaces, historic spaces, or other non-farmland spaces in the State; and (b) otherwise ensure that such plans, laws, and programs are implemented and are subject to enforcement, in future years, in a manner that is fully consistent with the provisions and intent of the 1[Farmland Assessment Act,] Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,1 P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), including all farmland assessment eligibility and benefits valuation requirements established pursuant thereto, and in a manner that does not serve to prevent, hinder, or otherwise impede fairness, equitability, or uniformity in association with the Statewide application and enforcement of farmland assessment program requirements, the Statewide allocation and distribution of farmland assessment benefits, or the Statewide achievement of farmland assessment goals; (7)   evaluate the ongoing impacts of inflation on the farmland assessment program; and develop recommendations to facilitate the appropriate modification of the programs income-based requirements, farm product sales requirements, and other relevant requirements, including those requirements that are necessary to establish initial eligibility for farmland assessment benefits, pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.5), and those requirements that are necessary to establish ongoing eligibility for the continued receipt of such benefits in each future tax year, as provided by section 15 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.15) and section 1 of P.L.1971, c.400 (C.54:4-23.15a), in order to mitigate any negative inflationary impacts on the program and its participants and to ensure the continued fair and equitable allocation of tax benefits thereunder, notwithstanding any existing or changing inflationary influences; and (8)   whenever, and to the extent that, the States farmland assessment laws, rules, regulations, protocols, standards, or procedures provide for, require, or necessitate the annual or other review of farm or farmer income, of farm product sales receipts, or of other documentation, including, but not limited to, attestations or other signature-based statements, certifying that land is devoted to use as farmland in accordance with the definitions developed pursuant to paragraph 1[(4)] (5)1 of this subsection:  (a) conduct a timely and independent review, assessment, and audit of all such documentation submitted for each farmland-assessed property in the State;

annually identify the current number, size, and location of all properties that are subject to farmland assessment in the State, as well as the total amount of farmland-assessed land, by acreage and percentage of all lands, lying within the jurisdictions of each county and municipality in the State; determine the rate at which the total number of farmland-assessed sites has increased, on a year-over-year basis, and by county and municipality, since the farmland assessment programs inception, and the rate at which such total number of farmland-assessed sites is expected to continue to increase, on a year-over-year basis, and by county and municipality, in future years of program operation; evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to impose conditions or restrictions that are designed to limit either the total value of benefits being annually allocated to farmland-assessed properties or the total number of properties annually entitled to receive such benefits, or to limit, by number or size, the types of properties that may be deemed newly eligible for farmland assessment benefits in each upcoming tax year; and, to the extent that the commission deems it feasible and appropriate to impose any such limits on total farmland assessment participation rates or benefits levels, or both, develop recommendations regarding the appropriate conditions or restrictions to be imposed for such purposes; (2)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, there is a need to establish, or to continue using, a dedicated source of State funding to facilitate the annual undertaking of local on-site inspections at all farmland-assessed sites in the State, as necessary to confirm each sites ongoing eligibility for continued program benefits, and whether, and the extent to which, it would be possible to cover the costs of such local on-site inspections by requiring the owners or operators of farmland-assessed sites to annually pay a mandatory inspection fee to be dedicated and used for such purposes;

and, to the extent the commission deems it to be appropriate and necessary, develop recommendations for actions that could be undertaken, or for new or revised laws, rules, regulations, procedures, protocols, and standards that could be implemented, by the Governor, by the Legislature, by the Department of Agriculture or the State Board of Agriculture, by local government units or local tax assessors, or by other relevant actors or entities, to facilitate and ensure greater levels of fairness and equitability in association with the year-to-year continuance of previously authorized farmland assessment benefits in the State, including, but not limited to, recommendations regarding the need for, and the feasibility and benefits of adopting, new or revised Statewide procedures that would expressly condition the continuance of benefits upon continued site eligibility therefor, and that would further require the amount of any such continued benefits to reflect, and to be commensurate with, each such eligible sites most recently reported farm product sales data; (4)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to establish new, means-tested farmland assessment eligibility requirements, and, if such action is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations to facilitate the implementation of such requirements, including, but not limited to, recommendations regarding the maximum amount of annual household income, or the maximum amount of annual farm income, which a site owner or operator should be authorized to claim before being deemed ineligible for farmland assessment benefits in any given year, recommendations regarding whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to provide for farmland assessment benefits to vary by site-related income bracket, and, if such income-based variation is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, recommendations regarding the manner in which benefits should be variably allocated, to site owners or operators in each eligible income bracket below the maximum income eligibility cap recommended pursuant to this paragraph, as necessary to ensure the fair and equitable allocation of annually available program benefits to each farmland-assessed site, commensurate with annual site-related income; (5)   review the standards and guidelines adopted pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.43 (C.54:4-23.3d), or pursuant to any other law, rule, or regulation, which are used to facilitate farmland assessment eligibility determinations in the State; evaluate whether, and the extent to which, it would be feasible and beneficial for the State to require such standards and guidelines to be updated on an annual or other regular basis; and, if such regular updating is deemed to be feasible and appropriate, develop recommendations regarding the preferred rate at which such updates should be made and setting forth simplified and clarified language and new or revised eligibility test criteria to be incorporated into the updated standards and guidelines, as necessary to facilitate and maximize consistency and Statewide uniformity in program eligibility determinations, and fairness and equitability in the valuation of program benefits annually allocated to eligible sites.  In developing initial recommendations for language changes pursuant to this paragraph, the commission shall include, at a minimum, suggestions designed to facilitate the implementation and use, pursuant to such standards and guidelines, of clearer and more concise definitions regarding what it means for a site to be:  (a) devoted to the production for sale of plants and animals useful to man, as necessary for the site to be deemed in agricultural use, pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.3); (b) devoted to the production for sale of fruits of all kinds or devoted to and meeting the requirements and qualifications for payments or other compensation pursuant to a soil conservation program under an agreement with an agency of the Federal Government, as necessary for the site to be deemed in horticultural use, pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.4); and (c) actively devoted to agricultural or horticultural use, as necessary for the site to be deemed annually eligible for farmland assessment benefits, pursuant to sections 2, 5, 6, 7, and 11 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.2, C.54:4-23.5, C.54:4-23.6, C.54:4-23.7, and C.54:4-23.11); (6)   evaluate whether, and the extent to which, the implementation of the Pinelands Protection Act, P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et seq.), the States Green Acres, Blue Acres, and historic preservation programs, established pursuant to the Garden State Preservation Trust Act, P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13:8C-1 et seq.) and the Preserve New Jersey Act, P.L.2016, c.12 (C.13:8C-43 et seq.), the States forest stewardship plans and program, established pursuant to P.L.2009, c.256 (C.13:1L-29 et seq.), and any other plans, programs, or laws relating to the acquisition, preservation, stewardship, management, or maintenance of open spaces, green spaces, historic spaces, forested or woodland spaces, or other non-farmland spaces in the State, whether implemented or administered by the State, by individual counties or municipalities therein, or cooperatively, by both State and local government officials, are functioning, in practice, in a manner that serves to reduce, hinder, or otherwise restrict the fair, equitable, and uniform Statewide application and enforcement of farmland assessment program requirements, or the fair and equitable allocation and distribution of farmland assessment program benefits on a Statewide basis; and develop recommendations regarding the actions that could be undertaken by the Governor, by the Legislature, by the Department of Agriculture or the State Board of Agriculture, by local government units or local tax assessors, or by other relevant actors or entities, and the other available means and methods that could be utilized in the State, to:  (a) reduce, eliminate, or prevent any such negative effects on the farmland assessment program which have resulted, or which may result, from the implementation of any such plans, laws, or programs relating to the preservation, stewardship, management, or ongoing use of open spaces, green spaces, historic spaces, or other non-farmland spaces in the State; and (b) otherwise ensure that such plans, laws, and programs are implemented and are subject to enforcement, in future years, in a manner that is fully consistent with the provisions and intent of the 1[Farmland Assessment Act,] Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,1 P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), including all farmland assessment eligibility and benefits valuation requirements established pursuant thereto, and in a manner that does not serve to prevent, hinder, or otherwise impede fairness, equitability, or uniformity in association with the Statewide application and enforcement of farmland assessment program requirements, the Statewide allocation and distribution of farmland assessment benefits, or the Statewide achievement of farmland assessment goals; (7)   evaluate the ongoing impacts of inflation on the farmland assessment program; and develop recommendations to facilitate the appropriate modification of the programs income-based requirements, farm product sales requirements, and other relevant requirements, including those requirements that are necessary to establish initial eligibility for farmland assessment benefits, pursuant to subsection a. of section 5 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.5), and those requirements that are necessary to establish ongoing eligibility for the continued receipt of such benefits in each future tax year, as provided by section 15 of P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.15) and section 1 of P.L.1971, c.400 (C.54:4-23.15a), in order to mitigate any negative inflationary impacts on the program and its participants and to ensure the continued fair and equitable allocation of tax benefits thereunder, notwithstanding any existing or changing inflationary influences; and (8)   whenever, and to the extent that, the States farmland assessment laws, rules, regulations, protocols, standards, or procedures provide for, require, or necessitate the annual or other review of farm or farmer income, of farm product sales receipts, or of other documentation, including, but not limited to, attestations or other signature-based statements, certifying that land is devoted to use as farmland in accordance with the definitions developed pursuant to paragraph 1[(4)] (5)1 of this subsection:  (a) conduct a timely and independent review, assessment, and audit of all such documentation submitted for each farmland-assessed property in the State; and (b) develop and submit, to the Department of Agriculture, the State Agriculture Development Committee, and the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, on an annual or more frequent basis, a list identifying any and all such properties, including the address and the name of the owner and operator thereof, for which requisite documentation, in this regard, is deemed by the commission to be missing, to be materially incomplete, to be untimely submitted, or to contain any materially false, fraudulent, or deceptive information relevant to farmland assessment determinations.  Any such person or parcel of property which is identified on a commission list, developed pursuant to this paragraph, shall be deemed subject to the loss of the farmland assessment privilege, shall be required to repay, within 90 days after written notice thereof and an opportunity for a hearing on the matter, any farmland assessment benefits already allocated or awarded thereto for the tax year in which the requisite documentation is deemed by the commission to be insufficient, and shall be deemed automatically ineligible for farmland assessment benefits in any future tax year.  Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, the commission shall be authorized to approve a waiver of the loss of privilege impacting a property, pursuant to this paragraph, whenever and provided that the commission determines, upon petition thereto, that such property has been transferred to a new owner or operator and, moreover, that none of the propertys current owners or operators, following such transfer, are identified on any commission list developed pursuant to this paragraph. c.     The commission shall consist of nine members, including the Secretary of Agriculture and the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, or their designees, who shall serve ex officio, and seven public members to be appointed as follows: (1)   one resident of the State who is employed by, or who otherwise operates under the authority and supervision of, the Department of Agriculture and has extensive expertise in, and is responsible for overseeing, or is otherwise actively involved in, the practical, day-to-day implementation of, and the effectuation of the departments role and duties under, the 1[Farmland Assessment Act,] Farmland Assessment Act of 1964,1 P.L.1964, c.48 (C.54:4-23.1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, to be appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture;
