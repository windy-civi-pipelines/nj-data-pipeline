District 7 (Burlington) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Assemblywoman  MICHELE MATSIKOUDIS District 21 (Middlesex, Morris, Somerset and Union) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Speight and McCoy SYNOPSIS Adopts Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act adopting the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact and supplementing Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.   The State of New Jersey enacts and enters into the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact with all other jurisdictions that legally join the compact in the form substantially as follows: Section 1.  Title and Purpose. This statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. The purposes of this compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state the ability to practice in participating states in which they are not licensed.  The compact does this by establishing a pathway for dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a compact privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating state in which they are not licensed.  The compact enables participating states to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such dentists and dental hygienists, through the states authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the state.  The compact: a.   Enables dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact privilege to practice in other participating states without satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a license to practice in those states; b.   Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each participating states acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state; c.   Increases public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in participating states; d.   Enhances the ability of participating states to protect the publics health and safety; e.   Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a participating state; f.    Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among participating states; g.   Requires dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating state pursuant to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice authorized in that state; h.   Extends the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to dentists and dental hygienists who practice in the state through a compact privilege; i.    Promotes the cooperation of participating states in regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those states; and j.    Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

Section 5.  Active Military Members and Their Spouses. Active military members and the spouses of active military members shall not be required to pay to the commission for a compact privilege the fee otherwise charged by the commission.  If a remote state chooses to charge a fee for a compact privilege, it may choose to charge a reduced fee or no fee to active military members and spouses of active military members for a compact privilege. Section 6.  Adverse Actions. a.   A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have exclusive authority to impose adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that participating state. b.   A participating state may take adverse action based on significant investigative information of a remote state, provided the participating state follows its own procedures for imposing adverse action. c.   Nothing in this compact shall override a participating states decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the participating states laws.  Participating states shall require licensees who enter any alternative program in lieu of discipline to agree not to practice pursuant to a compact privilege in any other participating state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other participating state. d.   Any participating state in which a licensee is applying to practice or is practicing pursuant to a compact privilege may investigate actual or alleged violations of the statutes and regulations authorizing the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in any other participating state in which the dentist or dental hygienist holds a license or compact privilege. e.   A remote state shall have the authority to: (1)  Take adverse actions as set forth in subsection d. of section 4 of the compact against a licensees compact privilege in the state; (2)  In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the compact and the commissions rules, issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority in a participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of evidence from another participating state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and (3)  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the licensee the costs of investigation and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee. f.    Joint Investigations.

(2)  Participating states shall share any significant investigative information, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact. g.   Authority to Continue Investigation. (1)  After a licensees compact privilege in a remote state is terminated, the remote state may continue an investigation of the licensee that began when the licensee had a compact privilege in that remote state. (2)  If the investigation yields what would be significant investigative information had the licensee continued to have a compact privilege in that remote state, the remote state shall report the presence of such information to the data system as required by paragraph (6) of subsection b. of section 8 of the compact as if it was significant investigative information. Section 7.  Establishment and Operation of the Commission. a.   The compact participating states hereby create and establish a joint government agency, the membership of which shall comprise all participating states that have enacted the compact.  The commission shall be an instrumentality of the participating states acting jointly and not an instrumentality of any one state.  The commission shall come into existence on or after the effective date of the compact as set forth in subsection a. of section 11 of this compact. b.   Participation, Voting, and Meetings.

Rulemaking. a.   The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact.  A commission rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review. b.   The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state, provided, however, that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the participating states scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. c.   The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the commission for each rule. d.   If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule or portion of a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the compact. e.   Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. f.    Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. g.   Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking as follows: (1)  On the Internet website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform; (2)  To persons who have requested notice of the commissions notices of proposed rulemaking; and (3)  In such other ways as the commission may by rule specify. h.   The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1)  The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule; (2)  If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking; (3)  The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule; (4)  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and (5)  The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments. i.    All hearings shall be recorded.  A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public. j.    Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each commission rule.  Rules may be grouped for convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section. k.   The commission shall, by a majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record. (1)  The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the changes do not enlarge the original purposes of the proposed rule. (2)  The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3)  The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule.  Except for an emergency as provided in subsection l. of this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after the commission issues notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l.    Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: (1)  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (2)  Prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds; (3)  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or (4)  Protect public health and safety. m.  The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the Internet website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. n.   No participating states rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. Section 10.  Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement. a.   Oversight. (1)  The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2)  Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located.  The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.  Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3)  The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or commission rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b.   Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination. (1)  If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state.  The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2)  The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other participating states. c.   If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d.   Termination of participation in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the defaulting states governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, the defaulting states state licensing authority or authorities, as applicable, and each of the participating states state licensing authority or authorities, as applicable. e.   A state that has been terminated from participation in the compact shall be responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. f.    Upon the termination of a states participation in this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees of the state, including licensees of other participating states issued a compact privilege to practice within that state, of such termination.  The terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges then in effect in that state for a minimum of 180 days after the date of the notice of termination. g.   The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. h.   The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i.    Dispute Resolution. (1)  Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among participating states and between participating states and nonparticipating states. (2)  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. j.    Enforcement. (1)  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact and the commissions rules. (2)  By a majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action against a participating state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting participating states law. (3)  A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (4)  No individual or entity other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission. Section 11.  Effective Date, Withdrawal, and Amendment. a.   The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state. (1)  On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, which shall be known as charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different from the model compact. (a)  If the enactment of a charter participating state is found to be materially different from the model compact, the charter participating state shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 10 of this compact. (b)  If any participating state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than seven. (2)  Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in paragraph (23) of subsection c. of section 7 of this compact to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3)  All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. (4)  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissions initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the commissions rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. b.   Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the states enactment of the compact. (1)  A participating states withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2)  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states licensing authority or authorities, as applicable, to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3)  Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, the withdrawing state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state 1[, including licensees of other participating states issued a compact privilege to practice within that state]1.  Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges to practice within that state granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c.   Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and a nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d.   This compact may be amended by the participating states.  No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted into the laws of all participating states. Section 12.  Construction and Severability. a.   This compact and the commissions rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact.  Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissions rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b.   The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of this section, the commission may deny a states participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10 of this compact, terminate a participating states participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is a material departure from the compact.  Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. Section 13.  Consistent Effect and Conflict with Other State Laws. a.   Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b.   Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a participating state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c.     All permissible agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill will adopt the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact in New Jersey, which is an interstate compact that will authorize dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a compact state to practice in any other compact state without being individually licensed in that other state. Licensees in a compact state seeking to practice dentistry or dental hygiene in another compact state will be required to apply for a compact privilege to practice in the other state, including paying any applicable fees.  States participating in the compact are required to meet certain requirements related to the licensure of dentists and dental hygienists, require criminal background checks of licensees and applicants for licensure, and participate in a data system that is used to track adverse actions taken against licensees in states participating in the compact.  An adverse action against a licensee in a compact state will suspend the licensees authorization to practice in all other compact states.  Licensees are subject to the practice laws and jurisdiction of the state in which the licensee is practicing. The compact will be overseen by a commission comprising one commissioner appointed from each member state.  An executive board made up of the chair, vice chair, secretary, and treasurer of the commission, as well as up to three additional commissioners, will be charged with the day-to-day administration of the compact.  The bill sets forth specific requirements concerning the operations and authorities of the commission and the executive board, as well as procedures for enforcing compliance with the compact. The compact takes effect when it is adopted in at least seven states.  As of May 2023, Iowa and Washington have enacted legislation adopting the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact.

The purposes of this compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental hygiene services by providing dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state the ability to practice in participating states in which they are not licensed.  The compact does this by establishing a pathway for dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a compact privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating state in which they are not licensed.  The compact enables participating states to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such dentists and dental hygienists, through the states authority to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the state.  The compact: a.   Enables dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact privilege to practice in other participating states without satisfying burdensome and duplicative requirements associated with securing a license to practice in those states; b.   Promotes mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each participating states acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state; c.   Increases public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental hygienists by creating a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in participating states; d.   Enhances the ability of participating states to protect the publics health and safety; e.   Does not interfere with licensure requirements established by a participating state; f.    Facilitates the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among participating states; g.   Requires dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating state pursuant to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice authorized in that state; h.   Extends the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within its borders to dentists and dental hygienists who practice in the state through a compact privilege; i.    Promotes the cooperation of participating states in regulating the practice of dentistry and dental hygiene within those states; and j.    Facilitates the relocation of military members and their spouses who are licensed to practice dentistry or dental hygiene.

Section 5.  Active Military Members and Their Spouses. Active military members and the spouses of active military members shall not be required to pay to the commission for a compact privilege the fee otherwise charged by the commission.  If a remote state chooses to charge a fee for a compact privilege, it may choose to charge a reduced fee or no fee to active military members and spouses of active military members for a compact privilege. Section 6.  Adverse Actions. a.   A participating state in which a licensee is licensed shall have exclusive authority to impose adverse action against the qualifying license issued by that participating state. b.   A participating state may take adverse action based on significant investigative information of a remote state, provided the participating state follows its own procedures for imposing adverse action. c.   Nothing in this compact shall override a participating states decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action and that such participation shall remain nonpublic if required by the participating states laws.  Participating states shall require licensees who enter any alternative program in lieu of discipline to agree not to practice pursuant to a compact privilege in any other participating state during the term of the alternative program without prior authorization from such other participating state. d.   Any participating state in which a licensee is applying to practice or is practicing pursuant to a compact privilege may investigate actual or alleged violations of the statutes and regulations authorizing the practice of dentistry or dental hygiene in any other participating state in which the dentist or dental hygienist holds a license or compact privilege. e.   A remote state shall have the authority to: (1)  Take adverse actions as set forth in subsection d. of section 4 of the compact against a licensees compact privilege in the state; (2)  In furtherance of its rights and responsibilities under the compact and the commissions rules, issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a state licensing authority in a participating state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or the production of evidence from another participating state, shall be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction according to the practice and procedure of that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it.  The issuing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state where the witnesses or evidence are located; and (3)  If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the licensee the costs of investigation and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that licensee. f.    Joint Investigations.

(2)  The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, and representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or as determined by the commission that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining counsel at that persons own expense; and provided further that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that persons intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct.

Section 9. Rulemaking. a.   The commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer the purposes and provisions of the compact.  A commission rule shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact or the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of review. b.   The rules of the commission shall have the force of law in each participating state, provided, however, that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the participating state that establish the participating states scope of practice as held by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in that state to the extent of the conflict. c.   The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules shall become binding as of the date specified by the commission for each rule. d.   If a majority of the legislatures of the participating states rejects a commission rule or portion of a commission rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, within four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any participating state or to any state applying to participate in the compact. e.   Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission. f.    Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments. g.   Prior to adoption of a proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking as follows: (1)  On the Internet website of the commission or other publicly accessible platform; (2)  To persons who have requested notice of the commissions notices of proposed rulemaking; and (3)  In such other ways as the commission may by rule specify. h.   The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include all of the following: (1)  The time, date, and location of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public comments on the proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule; (2)  If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice of proposed rulemaking; (3)  The text of the proposed rule and the reason for the proposed rule; (4)  A request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and (5)  The manner in which interested persons may submit written comments. i.    All hearings shall be recorded.  A copy of the recording and all written comments and documents received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available to the public. j.    Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each commission rule.  Rules may be grouped for convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section. k.   The commission shall, by a majority vote of all commissioners, take final action on the proposed rule based on the rulemaking record. (1)  The commission may adopt changes to the proposed rule, provided the changes do not enlarge the original purposes of the proposed rule. (2)  The commission shall provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were recommended by commenters. (3)  The commission shall determine a reasonable effective date for the rule.  Except for an emergency as provided in subsection l. of this section, the effective date of the rule shall be no sooner than 30 days after the commission issues notice that it adopted or amended the rule. l.    Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule with 24 hours notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of this subsection, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to do any of the following: (1)  Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; (2)  Prevent a loss of commission or participating state funds; (3)  Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or (4)  Protect public health and safety. m.  The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the Internet website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered to the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. n.   No participating states rulemaking requirements shall apply under this compact. Section 10.  Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement. a.   Oversight. (1)  The executive and judicial branches of state government in each participating state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the compact. (2)  Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is located.  The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution proceedings.  Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice, misconduct, or any such similar matter. (3)  The commission shall be entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or interpretation of the compact or commission rule and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide the commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. b.   Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination. (1)  If the commission determines that a participating state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state.  The notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. (2)  The commission shall provide a copy of the notice of default to the other participating states. c.   If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred on that state by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the default shall not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default. d.   Termination of participation in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the commission to the defaulting states governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting states legislature, the defaulting states state licensing authority or authorities, as applicable, and each of the participating states state licensing authority or authorities, as applicable. e.   A state that has been terminated from participation in the compact shall be responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination. f.    Upon the termination of a states participation in this compact, that state shall immediately provide notice to all licensees of the state, including licensees of other participating states issued a compact privilege to practice within that state, of such termination.  The terminated state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges then in effect in that state for a minimum of 180 days after the date of the notice of termination. g.   The commission shall not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state. h.   The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices.  The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. i.    Dispute Resolution. (1)  Upon request by a participating state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact that arise among participating states and between participating states and nonparticipating states. (2)  The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes, as appropriate. j.    Enforcement. (1)  The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this compact and the commissions rules. (2)  By a majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action against a participating state in default in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.  The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the defaulting participating states law. (3)  A participating state may initiate legal action against the commission in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees. (4)  No individual or entity other than a participating state may enforce this compact against the commission. Section 11.  Effective Date, Withdrawal, and Amendment. a.   The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh participating state. (1)  On or after the effective date of the compact, the commission shall convene and review the enactment of each of the states that enacted the compact prior to the commission convening, which shall be known as charter participating states, to determine if the statute enacted by each such charter participating state is materially different from the model compact. (a)  If the enactment of a charter participating state is found to be materially different from the model compact, the charter participating state shall be entitled to the default process set forth in section 10 of this compact. (b)  If any participating state is later found to be in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the compact, the commission shall remain in existence and the compact shall remain in effect even if the number of participating states should be less than seven. (2)  Participating states enacting the compact subsequent to the charter participating states shall be subject to the process set forth in paragraph (23) of subsection c. of section 7 of this compact to determine if their enactments are materially different from the model compact and whether they qualify for participation in the compact. (3)  All actions taken for the benefit of the commission or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of the compact prior to the effective date of the compact or the commission coming into existence shall be considered to be actions of the commission unless specifically repudiated by the commission. (4)  Any state that joins the compact subsequent to the commissions initial adoption of the rules and bylaws shall be subject to the commissions rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state.  Any rule that has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. b.   Any participating state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the states enactment of the compact. (1)  A participating states withdrawal shall not take effect until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute. (2)  Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing states licensing authority or authorities, as applicable, to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. (3)  Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from this compact, the withdrawing state shall immediately provide notice of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state 1[, including licensees of other participating states issued a compact privilege to practice within that state]1.  Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall continue to recognize all compact privileges to practice within that state granted pursuant to this compact for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of withdrawal. c.   Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and a nonparticipating state that does not conflict with the provisions of this compact. d.   This compact may be amended by the participating states.  No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any participating state until it is enacted into the laws of all participating states. Section 12.  Construction and Severability. a.   This compact and the commissions rulemaking authority shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes and the implementation and administration of the compact.  Provisions of the compact expressly authorizing or requiring the promulgation of rules shall not be construed to limit the commissions rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. b.   The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, a state seeking participation in the compact, or of the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. c.   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of this section, the commission may deny a states participation in the compact or, in accordance with the requirements of section 10 of this compact, terminate a participating states participation in the compact, if it determines that a constitutional requirement of a participating state is a material departure from the compact.  Otherwise, if this compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining participating states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. Section 13.  Consistent Effect and Conflict with Other State Laws. a.   Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of any other law of a participating state that is not inconsistent with the compact. b.   Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal requirements in a participating state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. c.     All permissible agreements between the commission and the participating states are binding in accordance with their terms. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill will adopt the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact in New Jersey, which is an interstate compact that will authorize dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a compact state to practice in any other compact state without being individually licensed in that other state. Licensees in a compact state seeking to practice dentistry or dental hygiene in another compact state will be required to apply for a compact privilege to practice in the other state, including paying any applicable fees.  States participating in the compact are required to meet certain requirements related to the licensure of dentists and dental hygienists, require criminal background checks of licensees and applicants for licensure, and participate in a data system that is used to track adverse actions taken against licensees in states participating in the compact.  An adverse action against a licensee in a compact state will suspend the licensees authorization to practice in all other compact states.  Licensees are subject to the practice laws and jurisdiction of the state in which the licensee is practicing. The compact will be overseen by a commission comprising one commissioner appointed from each member state.  An executive board made up of the chair, vice chair, secretary, and treasurer of the commission, as well as up to three additional commissioners, will be charged with the day-to-day administration of the compact.  The bill sets forth specific requirements concerning the operations and authorities of the commission and the executive board, as well as procedures for enforcing compliance with the compact. The compact takes effect when it is adopted in at least seven states.  As of May 2023, Iowa and Washington have enacted legislation adopting the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact.
