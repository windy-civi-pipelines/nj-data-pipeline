<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      This
statute shall be known and cited as the Dentist and Dental Hygienist Compact. 
The purposes of this compact are to facilitate the interstate practice of
dentistry and dental hygiene and improve public access to dentistry and dental
hygiene services by providing dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a
participating state the ability to practice in participating states in which
they are not licensed.  The compact does this by establishing a pathway for
dentists and dental hygienists licensed in a participating state to obtain a
compact privilege that authorizes them to practice in another participating
state in which they are not licensed.  The compact enables participating states
to protect the public health and safety with respect to the practice of such
dentists and dental hygienists, through the states authority to regulate the
practice of dentistry and dental hygiene in the state.  The compact:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      a.   Enables
dentists and dental hygienists who qualify for a compact privilege to practice
in other participating states without satisfying burdensome and duplicative
requirements associated with securing a license to practice in those states;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      b.   Promotes
mobility and addresses workforce shortages through each participating states
acceptance of a compact privilege to practice in that state;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      c.   Increases
public access to qualified, licensed dentists and dental hygienists by creating
a responsible, streamlined pathway for licensees to practice in participating
states;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      d.   Enhances
the ability of participating states to protect the publics health and safety;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      e.   Does
not interfere with licensure requirements established by a participating state;
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      f.    Facilitates
the sharing of licensure and disciplinary information among participating
states;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      g.   Requires
dentists and dental hygienists who practice in a participating state pursuant
to a compact privilege to practice within the scope of practice authorized in
that state;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='letter-spacing:0pt'>      h.   Extends
the authority of a participating state to regulate the practice of dentistry
