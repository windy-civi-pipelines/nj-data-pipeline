(cf: P.L.2018, c.36, s.1) 2.                This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill requires a chief law enforcement officer or Superintendent of State Police to notify federal immigration authorities when a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States applies for a firearms purchaser identification card (FPIC) or permit to purchase a handgun (PPH). Under current law, a person who purchases a rifle or shotgun is required to obtain a FPIC; handgun purchasers are required to obtain a PPH.  An applicant for a FPIC or PPH is required submit to the chief law enforcement officer or the superintendent, as appropriate, a written application, consent for a mental health records search, and two sets of fingerprints for a criminal history records background check. Federal law prohibits selling or transferring a firearm to a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s.922(d)(5). This bill incorporates the federal standard governing the sale or transfer of firearms to a non-citizen. In addition, the bill requires a chief law enforcement officer or the superintendent to notify and cooperate with federal immigration authorities when the officer or superintendent determines that an applicant for a FPIC or PPH is a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States.

STATEMENT This bill requires a chief law enforcement officer or Superintendent of State Police to notify federal immigration authorities when a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States applies for a firearms purchaser identification card (FPIC) or permit to purchase a handgun (PPH). Under current law, a person who purchases a rifle or shotgun is required to obtain a FPIC; handgun purchasers are required to obtain a PPH.  An applicant for a FPIC or PPH is required submit to the chief law enforcement officer or the superintendent, as appropriate, a written application, consent for a mental health records search, and two sets of fingerprints for a criminal history records background check. Federal law prohibits selling or transferring a firearm to a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s.922(d)(5). This bill incorporates the federal standard governing the sale or transfer of firearms to a non-citizen. In addition, the bill requires a chief law enforcement officer or the superintendent to notify and cooperate with federal immigration authorities when the officer or superintendent determines that an applicant for a FPIC or PPH is a non-citizen who is unlawfully present in the United States.
