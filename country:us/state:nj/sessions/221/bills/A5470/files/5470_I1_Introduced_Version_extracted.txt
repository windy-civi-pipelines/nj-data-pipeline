Prior to March 1, 2029, for redevelopment projects eligible pursuant to section 57 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-325) for which a developer is seeking an incentive award for the redevelopment project, the developer shall submit an application to the authority and, in the case of a residential project, shall submit an application to the authority and the agency, in a form and manner prescribed in regulations adopted by the authority pursuant to section 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-335).  The authority shall accept applications for incentive awards during the grant periods established pursuant to section 59 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-327). b.    The authority shall not consider an application for a commercial project unless the developer submits a letter evidencing support for the commercial project from the governing body of the municipality in which the commercial project is located with the application. c.     The authority shall review the project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, provided that the net benefit analysis shall not apply to capital investment for a food delivery source; a health care or health services center; an institutional project; or a residential project.  In determining whether a project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 [et seq.] et al.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developer's State or local tax liability.  The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state.  The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant.  A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer's application for a tax credit that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary.  The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed redevelopment project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. d.    (1) For a redevelopment project subject to the requirement of subsection c. of this section to be eligible for any tax credits under the program, a developer shall demonstrate to the authority that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State equaling an amount determined by the authority through regulation that exceeds the requested tax credit amount.  The developer shall certify, under the penalty of perjury, that all documents submitted, and factual assertions made, to the authority to demonstrate that the award of tax credits will yield a net positive benefit to the State in accordance with this subsection are true and accurate at the time of submission. (2)   A redevelopment project located in a government-restricted municipality shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (3)   A commercial project that contains 50,000 or more square feet of space devoted to research or technology focused incubator and conferencing facilities for one or more institutions of higher education or non-profit organizations, and which has a total project cost of not less than $50 million, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (4)   A redevelopment project that is predominantly commercial and that receives a federal historic rehabilitation tax credit pursuant to section 47 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.47, or a tax credit pursuant to the "Historic Property Reinvestment Act," sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through 34:1B-276), shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (5)   A commercial project that is located on land owned by the federal government on or before December 31, 2005 shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be up to 35 percentage points lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. (6)   A redevelopment project that is undertaken by a major cultural institution to renovate existing space or expand services into additional space, and in which the major cultural institution realizes all returns from the redevelopment project, shall yield a net positive benefit to the State that exceeds the requested tax credit amount, but the net benefit requirement set by the authority for such redevelopment projects may be lower than the net benefit requirement set by the authority for all other eligible redevelopment projects. e.     If at any time during the eligibility period the authority determines that the developer made a material misrepresentation on the developer's application, the developer shall forfeit the incentive award. f.     If circumstances require a developer to amend its application to the authority, then the developer, or an authorized agent of the developer, shall certify to the authority that the information provided in its amended application is true under the penalty of perjury. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.4) 4.    Section 61 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329) is amended to read as follows: 61. a. Up to the limits established in subsection b. of this section and in accordance with an incentive award agreement, beginning upon the receipt of occupancy permits for any portion of the redevelopment project, or upon any other event evidencing project completion as set forth in the incentive award agreement, a developer shall be allowed a total tax credit that shall not exceed: (1) 80 percent of the total project cost for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality or an institutional project; (2) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a redevelopment project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (3) 50 percent of the total project cost for any other redevelopment project. b.    The value of all tax credits approved by the authority under the program for a redevelopment project phase shall not exceed: (1) $120,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is located in a government-restricted municipality or an institutional project; (2) $90,000,000 per redevelopment project or phase for a redevelopment project that is allowed a tax credit under paragraph (2) of subsection a. of this section; and (3) $60,000,000 for any other redevelopment project or phase. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.7) 5.    Section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333) is amended to read as follows: 65. a.

(1) The authority may award incentive awards to transformative projects in accordance with the provisions of sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335). (2) (a) For transformative projects completed in phases, the developer shall enter into a transformative phase agreement with the authority. (b) As used in this subsection, "transformative phase agreement" shall mean a sub-agreement of the incentive award agreement that governs the timing, capital investment, and other applicable details of the respective phase of a phased project. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 57 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-325), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, a transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued a certificate of occupancy for the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within five years of executing the incentive award agreement, except that the authority may, in its discretion, extend this deadline by up to one additional year.  For transformative projects completed in phases, the transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued certificates of occupancy for all phases of the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within 10 years of executing either the incentive award agreement or the first transformative phase agreement corresponding to the transformative project. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 55 and 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 and C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, each phase of a transformative project completed in phases shall have a separate eligibility period.  After completing each phase, the developer shall submit a certification that the phase is completed.  If the authority approves the certification, the tax credit allowed to the developer shall be increased by the tax credit amount corresponding to that phase. Notwithstanding the different eligibility periods for each phase, all conditions and requirements applicable during an eligibility period pursuant to sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335) shall apply to the entire transformative project until the end of the eligibility period for the last phase. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, for a transformative project completed in phases, a review of the project financing gap shall be performed at the certification of completion of each phase, and the authority shall re-evaluate the developer's rate of return in the seventh year and at the end of the eligibility period for the last phase, provided that the authority may also re-evaluate the developer's rate of return during the fifth year of any earlier phase.

Projects that are predominantly residential or that are institutional projects shall be excluded from the calculation of the net benefit test required pursuant to this subsection. d.    In determining net benefits for any business or person considering locating in a transformative project and applying to receive from the authority any other economic development incentive subsequent to the award of transformative project tax credits pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333), the authority shall not credit the business or person with any benefit that was previously credited to the transformative project pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333). e.     The authority shall administer the credits awarded pursuant to this section in accordance with the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330 and C.34:1B-331). f.     Prior to allocating an incentive award to a developer, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan, and the developer shall certify that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the transformative project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. g.    Notwithstanding the limitation on incentive awards set forth in subsection b. of section 61 and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329 and C.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may allow a developer of a transformative project a tax credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1) (a) 80 percent of the total project cost for a transformative project that is located in a government-restricted municipality or an institutional project; (b) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential transformative project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (c) 50 percent of the total project cost for any other transformative project; (2) the total value of the project financing gap; or (3) $400,000,000, except that for a transformative project that is developed in phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the transformative project. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.9) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program) related to construction of institutional projects. Under the bill, the term institutional project is defined as a redevelopment project that is developed by, or in affiliation with, a public or private institution of higher education, and for which at least 51 percent of the square footage of the project is dedicated for the use of qualified research and development.  Qualified research and development is defined to mean research and development activities that are undertaken within a priority industry, including, but not limited to, technology, artificial intelligence, software development, financial services, financial services technology, film and digital media, advanced manufacturing, gaming, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, transportation, logistics, and renewable energy. Specifically, the bill requires the calculation of the project cost of an institutional project to include the construction and completion of:  research workspaces; meeting, classroom, dining, and dormitory spaces; and common areas, including, but not limited to, hallways, utility rooms, storage areas, and parking components.  The bill also provides that an institutional project is eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, which incentive award is limited to a maximum value of $120 million. To qualify for an incentive award under the Aspire Program, the bill provides that the developer of an institutional project is required to contribute capital of at least $30 million, regardless of the overall cost of the project, except when the project is located in a government-restricted municipality.  Under current law, the developer of a redevelopment project is required to contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project costs, except that if the project is located in a government-restricted municipality, the developer is required to contribute capital of at least 10 percent of the total project cost. Additionally, the bill provides that an institutional project is not subject to a net benefit analysis that is required for certain other redevelopment projects.  Under current law, an exemption from the net benefit analysis is provided for investments in residential projects, food delivery sources, and health care or health services centers. The bill also provides similar changes for institutional projects that qualify as transformative projects under the Aspire Program.  Specifically, the bill provides that these projects are eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, up to $400 million or the amount of the project financing gap.  The bill also exempts these projects from the net benefit analysis requirement.

As used in this section, "transformative project" means a redevelopment project: that has a project financing gap ; that has a total project cost of at least $150,000,000; that includes 200,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for a project located in a government-restricted municipality, that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms, or other infrastructure for film production, that includes 300,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for a project located in an enhanced area, or that includes 500,000 or more square feet of new or substantially renovated industrial, commercial, or residential space for any other project; and, for a commercial project, that is of special economic importance as measured by the level of new jobs, new capital investment, opportunities to leverage leadership in a high-priority targeted industry, or other state priorities as determined by the authority pursuant to rules and regulations promulgated to implement this section.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection b. of section 14 of P.L.2023, c.98 (C.34:1B-335.1) to the contrary, for applications submitted on and after the effective date of P.L.2023, c.98 (C.34:1B-335.1 et al.), if the redevelopment project is located entirely on land designated by the Department of Environmental Protection as a brownfield development area pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2005, c.223 (C.58:10B-25.1), and the project cost of the redevelopment project includes at least $15,000,000 in environmental remediation costs, the redevelopment project shall constitute a project of special economic importance.  A transformative project may be completed in phases, which phases may be determined by the authority based on factors such as written architectural plans and specifications completed before or during the physical work, certificates of occupancy, or financial and operational plans.  The criteria developed by the authority shall include, but shall not be limited to: (1) the extent to which the proposed transformative project would create modern facilities that enhance the State's competitiveness in attracting targeted industries; (2) (a) for a residential project, the construction of 700 or more new residential units; (b) for a residential project containing less than 700 new residential units, the construction of 200 or more new residential units if the project is located in a government-restricted municipality, 300 or more residential units if the project is located in an enhanced area, or 400 or more residential units for all other mixed-use projects; (c)   for a residential project containing less than 700 new residential units, the construction of 50,000 square feet or more of commercial space; and (d) for a residential project, 20 percent of the new residential units shall be constructed for occupancy by low- and moderate-income households with affordability controls as adopted by the authority, in consultation with the agency, in accordance with paragraph (2) of subsection a. of section 56 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-324), except that a residential project receiving a federal historic rehabilitation tax credit pursuant to section 47 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 26 U.S.C. s.47, or a tax credit pursuant to the "Historic Property Reinvestment Act," sections 2 through 8 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-270 through 34:1B-276), shall be exempt from the affordability controls related to bedroom distribution; and (3) the extent to which the proposed project would leverage the competitive economic development advantages of the State's mass transit assets, higher education assets, and other economic development assets in attracting or retaining both employers and skilled workers generally or in targeted industries. A "transformative project" shall not include a redevelopment project at which more than 50 percent of the premises is occupied by one or more businesses engaged in final point of sale retail. b. (1) The authority may award incentive awards to transformative projects in accordance with the provisions of sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335). (2) (a) For transformative projects completed in phases, the developer shall enter into a transformative phase agreement with the authority. (b) As used in this subsection, "transformative phase agreement" shall mean a sub-agreement of the incentive award agreement that governs the timing, capital investment, and other applicable details of the respective phase of a phased project. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 57 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-325), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, a transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued a certificate of occupancy for the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within five years of executing the incentive award agreement, except that the authority may, in its discretion, extend this deadline by up to one additional year.  For transformative projects completed in phases, the transformative project shall be completed, and the developer shall be issued certificates of occupancy for all phases of the transformative project facilities by the applicable enforcing agency, within 10 years of executing either the incentive award agreement or the first transformative phase agreement corresponding to the transformative project. (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 55 and 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 and C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, each phase of a transformative project completed in phases shall have a separate eligibility period.  After completing each phase, the developer shall submit a certification that the phase is completed.  If the authority approves the certification, the tax credit allowed to the developer shall be increased by the tax credit amount corresponding to that phase. Notwithstanding the different eligibility periods for each phase, all conditions and requirements applicable during an eligibility period pursuant to sections 55 through 67 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-323 through 34:1B-335) shall apply to the entire transformative project until the end of the eligibility period for the last phase. (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 60 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-328), or any other section of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-269 et al.) to the contrary, for a transformative project completed in phases, a review of the project financing gap shall be performed at the certification of completion of each phase, and the authority shall re-evaluate the developer's rate of return in the seventh year and at the end of the eligibility period for the last phase, provided that the authority may also re-evaluate the developer's rate of return during the fifth year of any earlier phase. (6) A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section, other than a project that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production, shall be located in an incentive area, a distressed municipality, a government-restricted municipality, or an enhanced area.  A transformative project receiving an incentive award pursuant to this section that includes 250,000 or more square feet of film studios, professional stages, television studios, recording studios, screening rooms or other infrastructure for film production may be located anywhere in the State.  The authority shall not consider an application for a transformative project unless the applicant submits with its application a letter evidencing support for the transformative project from the governing body of the municipality in which the transformative project is located. c.     The authority shall review the transformative project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.  In determining whether a transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State, the authority shall not consider the value of any taxes exempted, abated, rebated, or retained under the "Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law," P.L.1991, c.441 (C.40A:21-1 et seq.), the "Long Term Tax Exemption Law," P.L.1991, c.431 (C.40A:20-1 et al.), the "New Jersey Urban Enterprise Zones Act," P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.), or any other law that has the effect of lowering or eliminating the developer's State or local tax liability.  The determination made pursuant to this subsection shall be based on the potential tax liability of the developer without regard for potential tax losses if the developer were to locate in another state.  The authority shall assess the cost of these reviews to the applicant.  A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer's application for an incentive award that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary.  The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed transformative project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. Projects that are predominantly residential or that are institutional projects shall be excluded from the calculation of the net benefit test required pursuant to this subsection. d.    In determining net benefits for any business or person considering locating in a transformative project and applying to receive from the authority any other economic development incentive subsequent to the award of transformative project tax credits pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333), the authority shall not credit the business or person with any benefit that was previously credited to the transformative project pursuant to section 65 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-333). e.     The authority shall administer the credits awarded pursuant to this section in accordance with the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-330 and C.34:1B-331). f.     Prior to allocating an incentive award to a developer, the authority shall confirm with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, the Department of Environmental Protection, and the Department of the Treasury that the developer is in substantial good standing with the respective department, or the developer has entered into an agreement with the respective department that includes a practical corrective action plan, and the developer shall certify that each contractor or subcontractor performing work at the transformative project: (1) is registered as required by "The Public Works Contractor Registration Act," P.L.1999, c.238 (C.34:11-56.48 et seq.); (2) has not been debarred by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development from engaging in or bidding on Public Works Contracts in the State; and (3) possesses a tax clearance certificate issued by the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The authority may also contract with an independent third party to perform a background check on the developer. g.    Notwithstanding the limitation on incentive awards set forth in subsection b. of section 61 and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329 and C.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may allow a developer of a transformative project a tax credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1) (a) 80 percent of the total project cost for a transformative project that is located in a government-restricted municipality or an institutional project; (b) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential transformative project that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative project that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a municipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or (c) 50 percent of the total project cost for any other transformative project; (2) the total value of the project financing gap; or (3) $400,000,000, except that for a transformative project that is developed in phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this paragraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the transformative project. (cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.9) 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill modifies certain provisions of the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program) related to construction of institutional projects. Under the bill, the term institutional project is defined as a redevelopment project that is developed by, or in affiliation with, a public or private institution of higher education, and for which at least 51 percent of the square footage of the project is dedicated for the use of qualified research and development.  Qualified research and development is defined to mean research and development activities that are undertaken within a priority industry, including, but not limited to, technology, artificial intelligence, software development, financial services, financial services technology, film and digital media, advanced manufacturing, gaming, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, transportation, logistics, and renewable energy. Specifically, the bill requires the calculation of the project cost of an institutional project to include the construction and completion of:  research workspaces; meeting, classroom, dining, and dormitory spaces; and common areas, including, but not limited to, hallways, utility rooms, storage areas, and parking components.  The bill also provides that an institutional project is eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, which incentive award is limited to a maximum value of $120 million. To qualify for an incentive award under the Aspire Program, the bill provides that the developer of an institutional project is required to contribute capital of at least $30 million, regardless of the overall cost of the project, except when the project is located in a government-restricted municipality.  Under current law, the developer of a redevelopment project is required to contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project costs, except that if the project is located in a government-restricted municipality, the developer is required to contribute capital of at least 10 percent of the total project cost. Additionally, the bill provides that an institutional project is not subject to a net benefit analysis that is required for certain other redevelopment projects.  Under current law, an exemption from the net benefit analysis is provided for investments in residential projects, food delivery sources, and health care or health services centers. The bill also provides similar changes for institutional projects that qualify as transformative projects under the Aspire Program.  Specifically, the bill provides that these projects are eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, up to $400 million or the amount of the project financing gap.  The bill also exempts these projects from the net benefit analysis requirement.
