<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill modifies certain
provisions of the New Jersey Aspire Program (Aspire Program) related to
construction of institutional projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the term institutional
project is defined as a redevelopment project that is developed by, or in
affiliation with, a public or private institution of higher education, and for
which at least 51 percent of the square footage of the project is dedicated for
the use of qualified research and development.  Qualified research and
development is defined to mean research and development activities that are
undertaken within a priority industry, including, but not limited to,
technology, artificial intelligence, software development, financial services,
financial services technology, film and digital media, advanced manufacturing,
gaming, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, transportation, logistics, and
renewable energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, the bill requires
the calculation of the project cost of an institutional project to include
the construction and completion of:  research workspaces; meeting, classroom,
dining, and dormitory spaces; and common areas, including, but not limited to,
hallways, utility rooms, storage areas, and parking components.  The bill also
provides that an institutional project is eligible for an incentive award equal
to 80 percent of project costs, which incentive award is limited to a maximum value
of $120 million.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     To qualify for an incentive
award under the Aspire Program, the bill provides that the developer of an
institutional project is required to contribute capital of at least $30 million,
regardless of the overall cost of the project, except when the project is
located in a government-restricted municipality.  Under current law, the
developer of a redevelopment project is required to contribute capital of at
least 20 percent of the total project costs, except that if the project is
located in a government-restricted municipality, the developer is required to
contribute capital of at least 10 percent of the total project cost.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill provides
that an institutional project is not subject to a net benefit analysis that is
required for certain other redevelopment projects.  Under current law, an
exemption from the net benefit analysis is provided for investments in
residential projects, food delivery sources, and health care or health services
centers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides similar
changes for institutional projects that qualify as transformative projects
under the Aspire Program.  Specifically, the bill provides that these projects are
eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, up to
$400 million or the amount of the project financing gap.  The bill also exempts
these projects from the net benefit analysis requirement.</p>
