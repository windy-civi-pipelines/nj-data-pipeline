an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill imposes requirements
on certain entities (i.e., controllers) that determine the purposes and means
of processing personal data.  However, the provisions of the bill would only
apply to controllers, which conduct business in the State or produce products
or services that are targeted to residents of the State, and which control or
process the personal data of a minimum number of consumers each year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a controller
to provide notice to consumers of the collection and disclosure of personal
data, as that term is defined in the bill, to third parties. The bill also
sets forth various requirements concerning the information that is required to
be included in this notice.  The bill also imposes other requirements and
limitations on controllers regarding the processing of personal data, including
limiting the collection and processing of personal data, taking reasonable
measures to protect personal data, and obtaining consumer consent before processing
certain data.  Specifically, the bill imposes additional restrictions on the
processing of sensitive data, as defined in the bill, or the processing of a
childs personal data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill
requires a controller that processes personal data for purposes of targeted
advertising, the sale of personal data, or profiling in furtherance of
decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a
consumer to allow consumers to exercise the right to opt-out of such processing
through a user-selected universal opt-out mechanism.  The bill permits a
consumer to authorize another person to act on the consumers behalf to opt out
of the sale of personal data.  The bill prohibits a controller from
discriminating against a consumer if the consumer chooses to opt out of the
processing for sale, targeted advertising, or profiling in furtherance of
decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects of the consumers
personal data, provided certain exceptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a controller
to complete data protection assessments, as described in the bill, and to make
such assessments available to the Division of Consumer Affairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a
processor, in addition to a controller, has certain duties under the bill.  A
processor is required to cooperate with a controller so that a controller
remains in compliance with the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, the consumers
of a controller may submit a verified request to exercise any rights
established under the bill.  The bill requires a controller to respond to each
verified request within 45 days, except as extended in certain circumstances. 
Any information provided in response to a verified request would be provided
free of charge, except that a controller may charge a fee for a second or
subsequent request submitted within a 12-month period.  The bill also requires
a controller to establish a process for consumers to appeal the controllers
refusal to take action on a request.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also establishes
certain consumer rights concerning personal data, including the right to:
confirm whether a controller may process or access the consumers personal
data; correct inaccuracies in the consumers personal data; delete personal
data concerning the consumer; obtain a copy of the consumers personal data
held by the controller in a portable format; and opt out of the processing of
personal data for the purposes of (i) targeted advertising; (ii) the sale of
personal data; or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal
or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.</p>
