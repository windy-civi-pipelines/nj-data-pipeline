In the event any newspaper which shall have been qualified to publish legal advertisements shall move its publication office to any municipality in the same county or in an adjacent county in this State and which shall otherwise continue to meet the qualifications of this section, it shall be qualified to publish legal advertisements which it was qualified to publish prior to moving said publication office for a period of 2 years after the date of the moving of its publication office or such period as said newspaper shall have the highest paid circulation of any newspaper within the county or municipality which shall use said newspaper for legal advertisements. b.    Whenever a newspaper meets the qualifications in subsection a. of this section or has met these qualifications in the preceding two years prior to publication and is published in whole or in part electronically through the Internet,  or whenever there is no qualified newspaper, or in the event that the county, city or other municipality or municipal corporation is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, it shall be sufficient for the county, city or other municipality or municipal corporation to (1) publish on their official website and (2) post such notice in at least one public place reserved for such or similar announcements.  The publishing and posting shall be prominently displayed, and shall be published and posted continuously for the equivalent length of time as required by law for publishing in a newspaper. (cf: P.L.1979, c.84, s.1) 4.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Under current law, a public body is required to post certain public notices, such as resolutions, ordinances, advertisements, meetings, or publications, in newspapers prior to the public body taking action. This bill amends the definition of adequate notice for public meetings to allow public bodies to satisfy their meeting notice requirements by notifying newspapers that are published in part or in whole electronically via the Internet. Under the bill, a qualified or previously qualified newspaper that is now published in part or in whole electronically through the Internet, or when there is no qualified newspaper or the State or local body is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, the State or local body will publish on their publicly accessible website, and in at least one public place reserved for such or similar announcements.  This will be deemed as compliance with the publication requirements of the notice.  The publishing and posting will be prominently displayed, as well as published and posted continuously for the equivalent length of time as required by law for publishing in a newspaper.
