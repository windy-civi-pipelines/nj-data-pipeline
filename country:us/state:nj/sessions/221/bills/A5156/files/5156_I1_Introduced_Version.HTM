means a commission, authority, board, council, committee  or any other group of
two or more persons organized under the laws of this  State, and collectively
empowered as a voting body to perform a public  governmental function affecting
the rights, duties, obligations, privileges,  benefits, or other legal
relations of any person, or collectively authorized to  spend public funds
including the Legislature, but does not mean or include the  judicial branch of
the government, any grand or petit jury, any parole board or  any agency or

Apportionment Commission established under Article IV,  Section III, of the
Constitution, or any political party committee organized  under Title 19 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.   &quot;Meeting&quot; 
means and includes any gathering whether corporeal or by means of communication
equipment, which is attended by, or open to, all of the members of a public
body, held with the intent, on the part of the members of the body present, to
discuss or act as a unit upon the specific public business  of that body. 
Meeting does not mean or include any such gathering (1) attended by less than
an effective majority of the members of a public body, or (2) attended by or
open to all the members of three or more similar public bodies at a convention
or similar gathering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.   &quot;Public business
means and includes all matters which relate in any way, directly or indirectly,
to the performance of the public body's functions or the conduct of its
business.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.   &quot;Adequate
notice&quot; means written advance notice of at least 48 hours, giving the
time, date, location and, to the extent known, the agenda of any regular,
special or rescheduled meeting, which notice shall accurately state whether
formal action may or may not be taken and which shall be (1) prominently posted
in at least one public place reserved for such or similar announcements, (2) <u>physically</u>
mailed, <u>electronically mailed,</u> telephoned, telegrammed, or hand
delivered to at least two newspapers<u>, including newspapers published in part
or in whole electronically through the Internet,</u> which newspapers shall be
designated by the public body to receive such notices because they have the
greatest likelihood of informing the  public within the area of jurisdiction of
the public body of such meetings, one of which shall be the official newspaper,
where any such has been designated by  the public body or if the public body
has failed to so designate, where any has  been designated by the governing
body of the political subdivision whose geographic boundaries are coextensive
with that of the public body and (3) filed with the clerk of the municipality
when the public body's geographic boundaries are coextensive with that of a
single municipality, with the clerk  of the county when the public body's
geographic boundaries are coextensive with  that of a single county, and with

other public body the filing shall be with the clerk or chief administrative
officer of such other public body and each municipal or county clerk of each
municipality or county encompassed within the jurisdiction of such public
body.  Where annual notice or revisions thereof in compliance with section 13
of this act set forth the location of any meeting, no further notice shall be
required for such meeting.</p>

newspaper cannot meet these qualifications, itself, but has acquired another
newspaper which meets these qualifications, the acquiring newspaper shall be
deemed to meet these qualifications if it is published in the same municipality
and entered in the same post office as was the acquired newspaper.  Continuous
publication within the meaning of this section shall not be deemed interrupted
by any involuntary suspension of publication for a period not exceeding six
months, resulting from loss, destruction, mechanical or electrical failure of
typesetting equipment or printing presses or the unavailability, due to
conditions beyond the control of the publisher, of paper or other materials and
supplies necessary for operation, or resulting from a labor dispute with a
recognized labor union, and any newspaper so affected shall not be disqualified
hereunder in the event that publication is resumed within said period of six
months.</p>

meets the qualifications in subsection a. of this section or has met these
qualifications in the preceding two years prior to the publication and is
published in whole or in part electronically through the Internet, or whenever there
is no qualified newspaper, or in the event that the State or board or body is
unable to identify a qualified newspaper, it shall be sufficient for the State
or board or body to (1) publish on their official website and (2) post such
notice in at least one public place reserved for such or similar announcements. 
The publishing and posting shall be prominently displayed, and shall be published
and posted continuously for the equivalent length of time as required by law

Whenever, by law, it is required that there be published by printing and
publishing in a newspaper or newspapers, ordinances, resolutions or notices or
advertisements of any sort, kind or character by any county, city or other
municipality or municipal corporation, or by any municipal board or official
board, or body, or office, or officials, or by any person or corporation, such
newspaper or newspapers must, in addition to any other qualification now
required by law, meet the following qualifications, namely:  said newspaper or

have been published continuously in the municipality where its publication
office is situate for not less than 2 years and shall have been entered for 2
years as second-class mail matter under the postal laws and regulations of the
United States.  In case a newspaper cannot meet these qualifications itself but
has acquired another newspaper which meets these qualifications, the acquiring
newspaper shall be deemed to meet these qualifications if it is published in
the same municipality and entered in the same post office as was the acquired
newspaper.  Continuous publication within the meaning of this section shall
not  be deemed interrupted by any involuntary suspension of publication for a period
not exceeding 6 months resulting from loss, destruction, mechanical or
electrical failure of typesetting equipment or printing presses or the
unavailability, due to conditions beyond the control or the publisher, of paper
or other materials and supplies necessary for operation, or resulting from a
labor dispute with a recognized labor union, and any newspaper so affected
shall not be disqualified hereunder in the event that publication is resumed within
said period of 6 months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the purposes of this
section and for the purpose of qualifying for legal advertisements generally,
any newspaper which for not less than 2 years shall  have been continuously
printed in a building located within two municipalities and which for not less
than 2 years shall have continuously maintained its editorial and business
offices in said building shall be deemed to have been published continuously in
each of said municipalities during that period and its publication office shall
be deemed to have been situate in each municipality during that period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event any newspaper
which shall have been qualified to publish legal advertisements shall move its
publication office to any municipality in the same county or in an adjacent
county in this State and which shall otherwise continue to meet the
qualifications of this section, it shall be qualified to publish legal
advertisements which it was qualified to publish prior to moving said
publication office for a period of 2 years after the date of the moving of its
publication office or such period as said newspaper shall have the highest paid
circulation of any newspaper within the county or municipality which shall use
said newspaper for legal advertisements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.    Whenever a newspaper
meets the qualifications in subsection a. of this section or has met these qualifications
in the preceding two years prior to publication and is published in whole or in
part electronically through the Internet,  or whenever there is no qualified
newspaper, or in the event that the county, city or other municipality or
municipal corporation is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, it shall be
sufficient for the county, city or other municipality or municipal corporation
to (1) publish on their official website and (2) post such notice in at least
one public place reserved for such or similar announcements.  The publishing
and posting shall be prominently displayed, and shall be published and posted
continuously for the equivalent length of time as required by law for
publishing in a newspaper.  </u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, a public
body is required to post certain public notices, such as resolutions, ordinances,
advertisements, meetings, or publications, in newspapers prior to the public
body taking action.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill amends the
definition of adequate notice for public meetings to allow public bodies to
satisfy their meeting notice requirements by notifying newspapers that are
published in part or in whole electronically via the Internet.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a qualified or
previously qualified newspaper that is now published in part or in whole electronically
through the Internet, or when there is no qualified newspaper or the State or
local body is unable to identify a qualified newspaper, the State or local body
will publish on their publicly accessible website, and in at least one public
place reserved for such or similar announcements.  This will be deemed as
compliance with the publication requirements of the notice.  The publishing and
posting will be prominently displayed, as well as published and posted
continuously for the equivalent length of time as required by law for
publishing in a newspaper.</p>
