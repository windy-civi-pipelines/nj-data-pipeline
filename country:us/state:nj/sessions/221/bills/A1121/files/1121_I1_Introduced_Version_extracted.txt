The provisions of section 23 of P.L.2003, c.117 amendatory of this section shall apply to licenses issued or transferred on or after July 1, 2003, and to license renewals commencing on or after July 1, 2003. Sporting facility license. 6. The holder of this license shall be entitled, subject to rules and regulations, to sell at retail or to serve any alcoholic beverages as the owner, operator, lessee, or concessionaire of a sporting facility by the glass or other receptacle or in original containers only on the premises of the sporting facility. Notwithstanding any other provision of Title 33 of the Revised Statutes and subject to conditions established by the director, the holder of this license may share direction and control of the premises to be licensed and share proceeds and profits from the sale of alcoholic beverages with the owner, operator, concessionaire, or lessee of the facility.  The holder of this license shall be permitted to conduct consumer wine, beer, and spirits tasting events and samplings for a fee or on a complimentary basis provided, however, the license holder complies with the provisions of section 3 of P.L.2009, c.216 (C.33:1-12d) and rules and regulations promulgated thereto.  Notwithstanding any law, rule or regulation to the contrary, the holder of this license shall be entitled to establish an all-inclusive area within the licensed sporting facility, provided the all-inclusive area is limited to one area within the sporting facility for each game or event and the capacity of the all-inclusive area does not exceed 500 persons. The fee for this license shall be $2,500 for venues with a capacity of less than 7,500 persons; $5,000 for venues with a capacity of not less than 7,500 persons but not more than 14,999 persons; $7,500 for venues with a capacity of not less than 15,000 persons but not more than 22,499 persons; and $10,000 for venues with a capacity of 22,500 persons or more.

"Team training facility" shall include team offices and team headquarters. (cf: P.L.2018, c.147, s.1) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill prohibits the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) from charging a fee to a municipality in connection with the renewal of a plenary retail consumption license. A plenary retail consumption license entitles the holder to sell any alcoholic beverages for consumption on the licensed premises by the glass or other open receptacle, and also to sell any alcoholic beverages in original containers for consumption off the licensed premises. The ABC charges current holders of the license a renewal fee of $200. This bill would prohibit the ABC from requiring municipalities to pay an additional fee in connection with the processing of renewal applications.
