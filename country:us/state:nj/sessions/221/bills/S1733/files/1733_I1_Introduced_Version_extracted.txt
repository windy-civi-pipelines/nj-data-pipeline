This section shall not apply to an officer or employee with regard to travel solely to the Philadelphia, New York City, or Wilmington metropolitan areas to meet with federal or state government officers or employees, or members of the States Congressional delegation or their officers or employees, for a period not to exceed one day, or to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area for the same purposes for a period not to exceed two consecutive days. 17.  Section 1 of P.L.1971, c.323 (C.40A:5-16.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    [Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.40A:5-16, the governing body of any local unit may, by resolution, provide for and authorize payment of advances to officers and employees of the local unit toward their expenses for authorized official travel and expenses incident thereto.  Any such resolution shall provide for the verification and adjustment of such expenses and advances and the repayment of any excess advanced by means of a detailed bill of items or demand and the certifications or affidavit required by N.J.S.40A:5-16 which shall be submitted within 10 days after the completion of the travel for which an advance was made.] a.     As used in this section: (1)   "Travel expenditures" means those costs paid by the local unit using local, State, or federal funds, whether directly by the local district or by reimbursement, for travel by local unit officers and employees, to the following four types of travel events: (a)   "training and seminars" which means all regularly scheduled, formal residential or non-residential training functions, conducted at a hotel, motel, convention center, residential facility, or at any educational institution or facility; (b)   "conventions and conferences" which means general programs, sponsored by professional associations on a regular basis, which address subjects of particular interest to a local unit or are convened to conduct association business.  The primary purpose of attendance at conferences and conventions is the development of new skills and knowledge or the reinforcement of those skills and knowledge in a particular field related to local unit operations.  These are distinct from formal staff training and seminars, although some training may take place at such events; (c)   "regular local unit business" which means all regular official business travel, including attendance at meetings, conferences and any other gatherings which are not covered by the definitions included in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph; (d)   "retreats" which mean meetings with local unit officers and employees, held away from the normal work environment at which organizational goals and objectives are discussed.  If available, local unit facilities shall be utilized for this type of event.

(2)   for travel that is critical to the needs of the local unit or furthers the efficient operation of the local unit; and (3)   in compliance with State travel payment guidelines as established by the Department of the Treasury and with guidelines established by the federal Office of Management and Budget; except that those guidelines that conflict with the provisions of Title 40A of the New Jersey Statutes shall not be applicable, including, but not limited to, the authority to issue travel charge cards.  The governing body shall specify in its travel policy the applicable restrictions and requirements set forth in the State and federal guidelines including, but not limited to, types of travel, methods of transportation, mileage allowance, subsistence allowance, and submission of supporting documentation including receipts, checks or vouchers. d.    A governing body shall include in its travel policy a requirement for the officer or employee to submit to an appropriate party as designated, and within a timeframe specified by the local unit's travel policy, a brief report that includes the primary purpose for the travel and the key issues that were addressed at the event and their relevance to improving the operation of the local unit. e.     A governing body shall require in its travel policy that detailed documentation be maintained on file in the local unit which demonstrates compliance with the local unit's travel policy including travel approvals, reports, and receipts for all local unit funded expenditures, as appropriate. f.     A governing body shall require in its policy that travel occur only upon prior written approval of the chief financial officer and prior approval by a majority of the full voting membership of the governing body and that the travel be in compliance with the Local Government Ethics Law,.P.L.1991, c.29 (C.40A:9-22.1 et seq.) g.    A governing body may authorize in its travel policy an annual maximum amount per local unit officer and employee for regular business travel for which governing body approval is not required. h.    A governing body may also approve, at any time prior to the event, travel for multiple months as long as the governing body approval, as detailed in its minutes, itemizes the approval by event, total cost, and number of officers and employees attending the event.  General or blanket pre-approval for travel is not authorized.  Approval shall be itemized by event, event total cost, and number of officers and employees attending the event. i.     A local unit shall state in its policy that travel payments will be paid only upon compliance with this section and the local unit's travel policy provisions and approval requirements.  The policy shall state that the local unit will not ratify or approve payments or reimbursements for travel after completion of the travel event. j.     A local unit officer or employee shall not receive an amount for travel and travel-related expenses in advance of the travel. k.    A local unit travel policy shall require a member of the governing body to recuse himself from voting on travel if the governing body member, a member of his immediate family, or a business organization in which he has an interest, has a direct or indirect financial involvement that may reasonably be expected to impair his objectivity or independence of judgment. l.     A local unit travel policy shall prohibit a member of the governing body from acting in his official capacity in any matter in which he or a member of his immediate family has a personal involvement that is or creates some benefit to the governing body member or a member of his immediate family; or undertake any employment or service, whether compensated or not, which may reasonably be expected to prejudice his independence of judgment in the execution of his official duties. m.   A local unit travel policy may exclude from the requirements of prior governing body approval pursuant to subsection f. of this section any travel caused by or subject to contractual provisions, other statutory requirements, or federal regulatory requirements.  The governing body may not exclude such travel from the subsistence requirements pursuant to subsections n. and o. of this section and the annual maximum travel expenditure amount pursuant to subsection p. of this section. n.    A local unit travel policy shall not allow subsistence payment or reimbursement for one-day trips that do not involve overnight lodging except in limited circumstances authorized in Department of the Treasury guidelines. o.    A local unit travel policy shall allow subsistence payment or reimbursement for overnight travel is eligible as authorized in Department of the Treasury guidelines, except as otherwise superseded by the following: (1)   per diem payment or reimbursement for lodging and meals shall be actual reasonable costs, not to exceed the federal per diem rates as established in the federal register for the current year; (2)   lodging expenses may exceed the federal per diem rates if the hotel is the site of the convention, conference, seminar or meeting and the going rate of the hotel is in excess of the federal per diem rates.  If the hotel at the site of the convention, conference, seminar, or meeting is no longer available, lodging may be paid for similar accommodations at a rate not to exceed the hotel rate for the event; (3)   receipts are required for hotel expenses.  Meal expenses under the federal per diem allowance limits do not require receipts; (4)   in any case in which the total per diem reimbursement is greater than the federal per diem rate, except as stated in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the costs shall be considered to be excessive and shall not be paid by local unit funds; (5)   local units shall patronize hotels and motels that offer special rates to government employees unless alternative lodging offers greater cost benefits; and (6)   payment or reimbursement is approved for the full cost of an official convention meal that the officer or employee attends if the meal is scheduled as an integral part of the convention or conference proceedings.  If a meal is included in the registration fee, the allowance for the meal is not eligible for reimbursement. p.    Each local unit budget shall include a separate item of appropriation for travel, establishing a maximum local unit travel expenditure amount for the budget year, which the local unit shall not exceed in that budget year. (1)   The maximum local unit travel expenditure amount shall include all travel in accordance with this section supported by local and State funds. (2)   A local unit may exclude from the maximum travel expenditure amount amounts supported by federal funds and by dedicated revenues. q.    Each local unit shall maintain separate accounting for local unit travel expenditures as necessary to ensure compliance with the maximum travel expenditure amount.  This may include, but need not be limited to, a separate or offline accounting of such expenditures or expanding the local unit's accounting system.  The tracking system shall be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the board's policy and this section, and shall provide auditable information. r.     Any local unit that violates its maximum travel expenditure amount or that otherwise is not in compliance with the travel limitations set forth in this section may be subject to sanctions by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, including reduction of State aid in an amount equal to any excess expenditure. s.     A person who approves any travel in violation of the local unit's travel policy or this section shall be required to reimburse the local unit in an amount equal to three times the cost associated with attending the event. An officer or employee who travels in violation of the local units travel policy or this section shall be required to reimburse the local unit in an amount equal to three times the cost associated with attending the event. t.     The provisions of this section shall apply to the governing bodies and officers and employees of fire districts. (cf: P.L.1971, c.323, s.1) 18.  Section 1 of P.L.1983, c.475 (C.40A:14-81.5) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The provisions of section 1 of P.L.1971, c.323 (C.40A:5-16.1) are applicable to the governing body, officers and employees of [any] every fire district [may, by resolution, provide for and authorize payment of advances to officers and employees of the fire district toward their expenses for authorized official travel and expenses incident thereto.  The resolution shall provide for the verification and adjustment of the expenses and advances and the repayment of any excess advance by means of a detailed bill of items or demand and certification or affidavit in the same form as required by a local unit pursuant to N.J.S.40A:5-6 which shall be submitted within 10 days after the completion of the travel for which an advance was made]. (cf: P.L.1983, c.475, s.1) 19.  This act shall take effect on the 60th day after enactment, but shall not be construed to impair the obligation of any collective bargaining agreement or individual contract of employment in effect on the effective date. STATEMENT Sections 1 through 3:  These sections of the bill amend the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, N.J.S.A.52:13D-12 et seq., and the Legislative and Governmental Process Activities Disclosure Act, N.J.S.A.52:13C-18 et seq., to add to the provision on the acceptance of gifts by members of the Legislature, State officers and employees and special State officers and employees the officers and employees of the staff of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.  The bill amends provisions of current law that permit the acceptance by members and staff of the Legislature and Executive Branch officers and employees of gifts from lobbyists and governmental affairs agents totaling not more than $250 per year to permit only gifts involving a de-minimus value. Sections 4 through 10:  These sections of the bill amend the School Ethics Act, N.J.S.A.18A:12-21 et seq., and the Local Government Ethics Law, N.J.S.A.40A:9-22.1 et seq., to prohibit school board members, employees of school districts, and employees and officers of the New Jersey School Boards Association, and local government officers and employees, from soliciting or accepting any gift, favor, loan, political contribution, service, promise of future employment, or other thing of value under circumstances from which it may be reasonably inferred that the gift, favor, loan, contribution, service, promise, or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the officer or employee, directly or indirectly, in the discharge of official duties. The bill also modifies the standard which prohibits a member of the immediate family of such a person, or a business organization in which the public officer or employee has an interest, from soliciting or accepting gifts, favors, loans, political contributions, services, promises of future employment, or other things of value. Current law prohibits a family member or such a business organization from soliciting or accepting a gift or other thing of value based on an understanding that it was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the school or local government official or employee, including an employee of the New Jersey School Boards Association, in the discharge of official duties.  The bill changes the standard so that the prohibition applies in circumstances from which it may be reasonably inferred that the gift or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the official or employee in the discharge of official duties. The bill provides for the imposition of a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 for a violation of these prohibitions, and for possible removal from office and being barred from holding public employment for a period of up to five years if the violators conduct is found to constitute a willful and continuous disregard of the prohibitions. These sections of the bill also bar State officers and employees, special State officers and employees, members of the Legislature, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and officers and employees of the Office of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and local government and school district officers and employees, and the members of the immediate family of these officers, employees, and members, from soliciting, receiving, or agreeing to receive, whether directly or indirectly, any ticket or other form of admission to any place of entertainment that is provided free of charge or at a discounted rate by the sponsor, promoter, performer owner, or operator of the event or entertainment venue unless the same free or reduced admission is available to (a) the public; (b) a class consisting of all officers or employees of the State, local government, or school district, as appropriate, whether or not restricted on the basis of geographic consideration; (c) all members of a group or class in which membership is unrelated to public service; (d) all members of an organization, such as an employees' association or public employees credit union, in which membership is related to public service; or (e) a group or class that is not defined in a manner that specifically discriminates among public officers or employees on the basis of branch of government or type of responsibility, or on a basis that favors those of higher rank or rate of pay.  Free or discounted admission available to the member of the immediate family would be treated as available to the public officer, employee, or member. "Place of entertainment" is defined as any privately or publicly owned and operated entertainment facility within or outside of this State, such as a theater, stadium, museum, arena, racetrack or other place where performances, concerts, exhibits, games or contests are held and for which an entry fee is charged. Sections 4 through 11:  These sections also impose a two-year post employment restriction on a public officer or employee, or a member of the immediate family, or a partnership, firm, or corporation with which the officer or employee is associated or in which the officer or employee has an interest, or a partner, officer, director, or employee while the officer or employee is associated with such partnership, firm, or corporation, from holding, directly or indirectly, within two years next subsequent to the termination of the office or employment of such officer or employee, an interest in, or employment with, or from representing, appearing for or negotiating on behalf of, a vendor or contractor that was awarded a public contract with which the officer or employee had been substantially and directly involved by making an investigation, rendering a ruling, or giving an opinion at any time during the course of the officers or employees employment. This prohibition applies to all State officers and employees covered by the State conflicts of interest law, and including a member of the Legislature, and the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and their staff.  It also applies to members of boards of education, employees of school districts, and local government officers and employees.  A violation of this prohibition would result in a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, and the bill clarifies the jurisdiction of the various ethics boards over former local government officers and employees for enforcement purposes. Sections 12 through 15:  These sections prohibit the State, a county, a municipality, a local school district, a county college, or a fire district from providing, directly or indirectly, to any officer, employee, or elected official and the officer, employee or elected officer from accepting: a residence owned or leased by the government entity that the officer, employee, or official may use at any time for personal purposes, unless the use of the residence is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public; an allowance, stipend, subsidy, or other form of payment for the purchase, lease, or maintenance of a residence or a motor vehicle owned or leased by the officer, employee, or official, or by an immediate family member, for the personal or primarily personal use of the officer, employee, or official, except reasonable mileage reimbursement when the vehicle is used for the performance of duties; a motor vehicle owned or leased by the government entity that is assigned exclusively to the officer, employee, or official on a full-time basis, unless the assignment and use of the motor vehicle is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, inspections or audits of regulated facilities, entities, or persons, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public, or is essential, as documented in writing, for a specified period of time to the personal security of the officer, employee, or official; a driver or chauffer whose assigned full-time or part-time duties are to operate any motor vehicle in which the officer, employee, or official, or an immediate family member, is a passenger, unless the driver is a law enforcement officer who is assigned also to provide for the security of the officer, employee, or official when the need for such security has been documented; an exemption from the payment of any toll relating to the use of a State toll bridge or toll road or fare relating to the use of the transportation services of a State agency, or payment for any such toll or fare or any other travel expense for commuting between the place of residence and the place of employment or for tolls, fare, or other travel expense not directly related to the performance of duties by the officer, employee, or official; a personal line of credit or a credit card, or an allowance, stipend, subsidy, or other payment for a credit card, unless the use of a credit card is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, inspections or audits of regulated facilities, entities, or persons, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public; or tuition reimbursement for attendance of courses at an institution of higher education, including a county college, within or outside of this State, unless the course is taken at an accredited public institution of higher education in this State, the reimbursement is limited to not more than 50 percent of the tuition for each course, the employee receives a grade of at least a C or its equivalent, for the course, the course is directly related to the skills and knowledge required for the duties being performed by the officer or employee when the reimbursement is made or required for the performance of the duties of a position to which the officer or employee may directly be promoted from the current position, and the officer and employee agrees to remain a public officer or employee for five years after the final tuition reimbursement is made.  If the officer or employee does not remain a public employee for that period of time, the officer or employee must reimburse the public entity for tuition reimbursements made with the reimbursement pro-rated for the number of years the public officer or employee remains after the final tuition reimbursement is made.  This paragraph will not apply to tuition reimbursement for a course or program that provides a certification of a skill or understanding sufficient to perform or assess a particular technological, mechanical, industrial, operational, accounting, or construction process or function, and that certification is required for holding that office or employment. Other provisions of law relevant to the matters covered in these sections would remain applicable to the extent not inconsistent.  These provisions would not be construed to preclude the imposition of additional restrictions by directive or regulation. For the matters described above, the bill defines State to mean any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of the State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission or other instrumentality within or created by such department; any independent State authority, commission, instrumentality or agency; the Offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor and the officers and employees of those offices; the Legislature of the State, and any office, board, bureau or commission within or created by the Legislative Branch; institutions of higher education of this State; and, to the extent consistent with law, any interstate agency to which New Jersey is a party.  For a violation, the officer, employee, or elected official would have to pay a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 Section 16:  This section prohibits a State officer or employee or special State officer or employee, other than a member of the Legislature or such an officer or employee of the Legislature, but including the officers and employees of the Office of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, from undertaking any travel outside of the State, or within the State when it involves an overnight stay, when the expenses of that travel or the expenses incident thereto, or both, are paid in part or in whole with the public funds of a State agency unless that travel has been determined in advance by the office of the Governor to be essential to the performance of the duties of the officer or employee and approved in writing by the Governor or the Governors designee.  When the performance of the duties of an officer or employee require travel on a regular or recurring basis, the Governor may grant approval in advance for such travel, under such terms and conditions as the Governor determines, during a specified period of time not to exceed one year from the date of approval as determined by the Governor.  The bill bars an officer or employee from receiving an amount for travel and travel-related expenses in advance of the travel.  This requirement will not apply to an officer or employee for travel solely to the Philadelphia, New York City, or Wilmington metropolitan areas to meet with federal or state government officers or employees, or members of the States Congressional delegation or their officers or employees, for a period not to exceed two consecutive days, or to Washington, D.C., for the same purposes for two consecutive days. Sections 17 and 18:  These sections increase the accountability of local units of government regarding approvals and expenditures for travel by local government officers and employees.  While a 2007 law, N.J.S.A.18A:11-12, imposed stringent requirements regarding travel and expense reimbursement upon school board members and school district employees, local governments are afforded considerable discretion over authorizing and monitoring travel by local government officers and employees. These sections impose upon local governments travel restrictions and accountability measures that are substantially similar to those currently applicable to school districts.  The sections would require local governing bodies to adopt travel policies and procedures ensuring that all travel by local government officers and employees is necessary and fiscally prudent.  Local unit travel expenditures would have to be directly related to and within the scope of the officers or employee's current responsibilities, critical to the needs of the local unit or further the efficient operation of the local unit, consistent with the local unit 's professional development plan, and, except as otherwise provided in statutory law, in compliance with State travel payment guidelines established by the Department of the Treasury and the federal Office of Management and Budget. The bill provides that local units must adopt travel policies requiring: officers and employees to document the primary purpose for the travel, the key issues addressed at the event and their relevance to improving the operation of the local unit; governing bodies to maintain detailed documentation demonstrating compliance with the local unit's travel policy including travel approvals, reports, and receipts for all local unit funded expenditures; and that travel occur only upon prior written approval of the chief financial officer and prior approval of the governing body. These sections apply to the governing bodies and officers and employees of fire districts.

Other provisions of law relevant to the matters covered in this section shall remain applicable to the extent not inconsistent with this section.  This section shall not be construed to preclude the imposition of additional restrictions by directive or regulation. 16.  (New section)  A State officer or employee or special State officer or employee as defined in section 2 of P.L.1971, c.182, (C:52:13D-13), other than a member of the Legislature or such an officer or employee of the Legislature, but including the officers and employees of the Office of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, shall not undertake any travel outside of the State, or within the State that involves an overnight stay, when the expenses of that travel or the expenses incident thereto, or both, are paid in part or in whole with the public funds of a State agency, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1971, c.182, (C:52:13D-13), unless that travel has been determined in advance by the office of the Governor to be essential to the performance of the duties of the officer or employee and approved in writing by the Governor or the Governors designee.  When the performance of the duties of an officer or employee require travel on a regular or recurring basis, the Governor may grant approval in advance for travel, under such terms and conditions as the Governor shall determine, during a specified period of time not to exceed one year from the date of approval as determined by the Governor.  An officer or employee shall not receive an amount for travel and travel-related expenses in advance of the travel. This section shall not apply to an officer or employee with regard to travel solely to the Philadelphia, New York City, or Wilmington metropolitan areas to meet with federal or state government officers or employees, or members of the States Congressional delegation or their officers or employees, for a period not to exceed one day, or to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area for the same purposes for a period not to exceed two consecutive days. 17.  Section 1 of P.L.1971, c.323 (C.40A:5-16.1) is amended to read as follows: 1.    [Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.40A:5-16, the governing body of any local unit may, by resolution, provide for and authorize payment of advances to officers and employees of the local unit toward their expenses for authorized official travel and expenses incident thereto.  Any such resolution shall provide for the verification and adjustment of such expenses and advances and the repayment of any excess advanced by means of a detailed bill of items or demand and the certifications or affidavit required by N.J.S.40A:5-16 which shall be submitted within 10 days after the completion of the travel for which an advance was made.] a.     As used in this section: (1)   "Travel expenditures" means those costs paid by the local unit using local, State, or federal funds, whether directly by the local district or by reimbursement, for travel by local unit officers and employees, to the following four types of travel events: (a)   "training and seminars" which means all regularly scheduled, formal residential or non-residential training functions, conducted at a hotel, motel, convention center, residential facility, or at any educational institution or facility; (b)   "conventions and conferences" which means general programs, sponsored by professional associations on a regular basis, which address subjects of particular interest to a local unit or are convened to conduct association business.  The primary purpose of attendance at conferences and conventions is the development of new skills and knowledge or the reinforcement of those skills and knowledge in a particular field related to local unit operations.  These are distinct from formal staff training and seminars, although some training may take place at such events; (c)   "regular local unit business" which means all regular official business travel, including attendance at meetings, conferences and any other gatherings which are not covered by the definitions included in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph; (d)   "retreats" which mean meetings with local unit officers and employees, held away from the normal work environment at which organizational goals and objectives are discussed.  If available, local unit facilities shall be utilized for this type of event. (2)   Local unit travel expenditures include, but are not limited to, all costs for transportation, meals, lodging, and registration or conference fees to and for the travel event. (3)   Local unit travel expenditures include costs for all required training and all travel authorized in existing local unit employee contracts and local unit policies.  This includes, but is not limited to, required professional development and other staff training, required training for new governing body members, and attendance at specific conferences authorized in existing employee contracts. (4)   A local unit shall not bear costs for car rentals, limousine services, and chauffeuring costs to or during the event, as well as costs for employee attendance for coordinating other attendees' accommodations at the travel event. b.    The governing body of every local unit shall implement a policy and procedures pertaining to travel expenditures for its officers and employees that are in accordance with the provisions of this section. c.     A governing body shall ensure through its policy and procedures that all travel by its officers and employees is necessary and fiscally prudent, and shall include the requirement that all local unit travel expenditures are: (1)   directly related to and within the scope of the officers and employee's current responsibilities and, for employees, the local unit 's professional development plan; (2)   for travel that is critical to the needs of the local unit or furthers the efficient operation of the local unit; and (3)   in compliance with State travel payment guidelines as established by the Department of the Treasury and with guidelines established by the federal Office of Management and Budget; except that those guidelines that conflict with the provisions of Title 40A of the New Jersey Statutes shall not be applicable, including, but not limited to, the authority to issue travel charge cards.  The governing body shall specify in its travel policy the applicable restrictions and requirements set forth in the State and federal guidelines including, but not limited to, types of travel, methods of transportation, mileage allowance, subsistence allowance, and submission of supporting documentation including receipts, checks or vouchers. d.    A governing body shall include in its travel policy a requirement for the officer or employee to submit to an appropriate party as designated, and within a timeframe specified by the local unit's travel policy, a brief report that includes the primary purpose for the travel and the key issues that were addressed at the event and their relevance to improving the operation of the local unit. e.     A governing body shall require in its travel policy that detailed documentation be maintained on file in the local unit which demonstrates compliance with the local unit's travel policy including travel approvals, reports, and receipts for all local unit funded expenditures, as appropriate. f.     A governing body shall require in its policy that travel occur only upon prior written approval of the chief financial officer and prior approval by a majority of the full voting membership of the governing body and that the travel be in compliance with the Local Government Ethics Law,.P.L.1991, c.29 (C.40A:9-22.1 et seq.) g.    A governing body may authorize in its travel policy an annual maximum amount per local unit officer and employee for regular business travel for which governing body approval is not required. h.    A governing body may also approve, at any time prior to the event, travel for multiple months as long as the governing body approval, as detailed in its minutes, itemizes the approval by event, total cost, and number of officers and employees attending the event.  General or blanket pre-approval for travel is not authorized.  Approval shall be itemized by event, event total cost, and number of officers and employees attending the event. i.     A local unit shall state in its policy that travel payments will be paid only upon compliance with this section and the local unit's travel policy provisions and approval requirements.  The policy shall state that the local unit will not ratify or approve payments or reimbursements for travel after completion of the travel event. j.     A local unit officer or employee shall not receive an amount for travel and travel-related expenses in advance of the travel. k.    A local unit travel policy shall require a member of the governing body to recuse himself from voting on travel if the governing body member, a member of his immediate family, or a business organization in which he has an interest, has a direct or indirect financial involvement that may reasonably be expected to impair his objectivity or independence of judgment. l.     A local unit travel policy shall prohibit a member of the governing body from acting in his official capacity in any matter in which he or a member of his immediate family has a personal involvement that is or creates some benefit to the governing body member or a member of his immediate family; or undertake any employment or service, whether compensated or not, which may reasonably be expected to prejudice his independence of judgment in the execution of his official duties. m.   A local unit travel policy may exclude from the requirements of prior governing body approval pursuant to subsection f. of this section any travel caused by or subject to contractual provisions, other statutory requirements, or federal regulatory requirements.  The governing body may not exclude such travel from the subsistence requirements pursuant to subsections n. and o. of this section and the annual maximum travel expenditure amount pursuant to subsection p. of this section. n.    A local unit travel policy shall not allow subsistence payment or reimbursement for one-day trips that do not involve overnight lodging except in limited circumstances authorized in Department of the Treasury guidelines. o.    A local unit travel policy shall allow subsistence payment or reimbursement for overnight travel is eligible as authorized in Department of the Treasury guidelines, except as otherwise superseded by the following: (1)   per diem payment or reimbursement for lodging and meals shall be actual reasonable costs, not to exceed the federal per diem rates as established in the federal register for the current year; (2)   lodging expenses may exceed the federal per diem rates if the hotel is the site of the convention, conference, seminar or meeting and the going rate of the hotel is in excess of the federal per diem rates.  If the hotel at the site of the convention, conference, seminar, or meeting is no longer available, lodging may be paid for similar accommodations at a rate not to exceed the hotel rate for the event; (3)   receipts are required for hotel expenses.  Meal expenses under the federal per diem allowance limits do not require receipts; (4)   in any case in which the total per diem reimbursement is greater than the federal per diem rate, except as stated in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the costs shall be considered to be excessive and shall not be paid by local unit funds; (5)   local units shall patronize hotels and motels that offer special rates to government employees unless alternative lodging offers greater cost benefits; and (6)   payment or reimbursement is approved for the full cost of an official convention meal that the officer or employee attends if the meal is scheduled as an integral part of the convention or conference proceedings.  If a meal is included in the registration fee, the allowance for the meal is not eligible for reimbursement. p.    Each local unit budget shall include a separate item of appropriation for travel, establishing a maximum local unit travel expenditure amount for the budget year, which the local unit shall not exceed in that budget year. (1)   The maximum local unit travel expenditure amount shall include all travel in accordance with this section supported by local and State funds. (2)   A local unit may exclude from the maximum travel expenditure amount amounts supported by federal funds and by dedicated revenues. q.    Each local unit shall maintain separate accounting for local unit travel expenditures as necessary to ensure compliance with the maximum travel expenditure amount.  This may include, but need not be limited to, a separate or offline accounting of such expenditures or expanding the local unit's accounting system.  The tracking system shall be sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the board's policy and this section, and shall provide auditable information. r.     Any local unit that violates its maximum travel expenditure amount or that otherwise is not in compliance with the travel limitations set forth in this section may be subject to sanctions by the Commissioner of Community Affairs, including reduction of State aid in an amount equal to any excess expenditure. s.     A person who approves any travel in violation of the local unit's travel policy or this section shall be required to reimburse the local unit in an amount equal to three times the cost associated with attending the event. An officer or employee who travels in violation of the local units travel policy or this section shall be required to reimburse the local unit in an amount equal to three times the cost associated with attending the event. t.     The provisions of this section shall apply to the governing bodies and officers and employees of fire districts. (cf: P.L.1971, c.323, s.1) 18.  Section 1 of P.L.1983, c.475 (C.40A:14-81.5) is amended to read as follows: 1.    The provisions of section 1 of P.L.1971, c.323 (C.40A:5-16.1) are applicable to the governing body, officers and employees of [any] every fire district [may, by resolution, provide for and authorize payment of advances to officers and employees of the fire district toward their expenses for authorized official travel and expenses incident thereto.  The resolution shall provide for the verification and adjustment of the expenses and advances and the repayment of any excess advance by means of a detailed bill of items or demand and certification or affidavit in the same form as required by a local unit pursuant to N.J.S.40A:5-6 which shall be submitted within 10 days after the completion of the travel for which an advance was made]. (cf: P.L.1983, c.475, s.1) 19.  This act shall take effect on the 60th day after enactment, but shall not be construed to impair the obligation of any collective bargaining agreement or individual contract of employment in effect on the effective date. STATEMENT Sections 1 through 3:  These sections of the bill amend the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law, N.J.S.A.52:13D-12 et seq., and the Legislative and Governmental Process Activities Disclosure Act, N.J.S.A.52:13C-18 et seq., to add to the provision on the acceptance of gifts by members of the Legislature, State officers and employees and special State officers and employees the officers and employees of the staff of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.  The bill amends provisions of current law that permit the acceptance by members and staff of the Legislature and Executive Branch officers and employees of gifts from lobbyists and governmental affairs agents totaling not more than $250 per year to permit only gifts involving a de-minimus value. Sections 4 through 10:  These sections of the bill amend the School Ethics Act, N.J.S.A.18A:12-21 et seq., and the Local Government Ethics Law, N.J.S.A.40A:9-22.1 et seq., to prohibit school board members, employees of school districts, and employees and officers of the New Jersey School Boards Association, and local government officers and employees, from soliciting or accepting any gift, favor, loan, political contribution, service, promise of future employment, or other thing of value under circumstances from which it may be reasonably inferred that the gift, favor, loan, contribution, service, promise, or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the officer or employee, directly or indirectly, in the discharge of official duties. The bill also modifies the standard which prohibits a member of the immediate family of such a person, or a business organization in which the public officer or employee has an interest, from soliciting or accepting gifts, favors, loans, political contributions, services, promises of future employment, or other things of value. Current law prohibits a family member or such a business organization from soliciting or accepting a gift or other thing of value based on an understanding that it was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the school or local government official or employee, including an employee of the New Jersey School Boards Association, in the discharge of official duties.  The bill changes the standard so that the prohibition applies in circumstances from which it may be reasonably inferred that the gift or other thing of value was given or offered for the purpose of influencing the official or employee in the discharge of official duties. The bill provides for the imposition of a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 for a violation of these prohibitions, and for possible removal from office and being barred from holding public employment for a period of up to five years if the violators conduct is found to constitute a willful and continuous disregard of the prohibitions. These sections of the bill also bar State officers and employees, special State officers and employees, members of the Legislature, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor and officers and employees of the Office of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and local government and school district officers and employees, and the members of the immediate family of these officers, employees, and members, from soliciting, receiving, or agreeing to receive, whether directly or indirectly, any ticket or other form of admission to any place of entertainment that is provided free of charge or at a discounted rate by the sponsor, promoter, performer owner, or operator of the event or entertainment venue unless the same free or reduced admission is available to (a) the public; (b) a class consisting of all officers or employees of the State, local government, or school district, as appropriate, whether or not restricted on the basis of geographic consideration; (c) all members of a group or class in which membership is unrelated to public service; (d) all members of an organization, such as an employees' association or public employees credit union, in which membership is related to public service; or (e) a group or class that is not defined in a manner that specifically discriminates among public officers or employees on the basis of branch of government or type of responsibility, or on a basis that favors those of higher rank or rate of pay.  Free or discounted admission available to the member of the immediate family would be treated as available to the public officer, employee, or member. "Place of entertainment" is defined as any privately or publicly owned and operated entertainment facility within or outside of this State, such as a theater, stadium, museum, arena, racetrack or other place where performances, concerts, exhibits, games or contests are held and for which an entry fee is charged. Sections 4 through 11:  These sections also impose a two-year post employment restriction on a public officer or employee, or a member of the immediate family, or a partnership, firm, or corporation with which the officer or employee is associated or in which the officer or employee has an interest, or a partner, officer, director, or employee while the officer or employee is associated with such partnership, firm, or corporation, from holding, directly or indirectly, within two years next subsequent to the termination of the office or employment of such officer or employee, an interest in, or employment with, or from representing, appearing for or negotiating on behalf of, a vendor or contractor that was awarded a public contract with which the officer or employee had been substantially and directly involved by making an investigation, rendering a ruling, or giving an opinion at any time during the course of the officers or employees employment. This prohibition applies to all State officers and employees covered by the State conflicts of interest law, and including a member of the Legislature, and the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and their staff.  It also applies to members of boards of education, employees of school districts, and local government officers and employees.  A violation of this prohibition would result in a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000, and the bill clarifies the jurisdiction of the various ethics boards over former local government officers and employees for enforcement purposes. Sections 12 through 15:  These sections prohibit the State, a county, a municipality, a local school district, a county college, or a fire district from providing, directly or indirectly, to any officer, employee, or elected official and the officer, employee or elected officer from accepting: a residence owned or leased by the government entity that the officer, employee, or official may use at any time for personal purposes, unless the use of the residence is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public; an allowance, stipend, subsidy, or other form of payment for the purchase, lease, or maintenance of a residence or a motor vehicle owned or leased by the officer, employee, or official, or by an immediate family member, for the personal or primarily personal use of the officer, employee, or official, except reasonable mileage reimbursement when the vehicle is used for the performance of duties; a motor vehicle owned or leased by the government entity that is assigned exclusively to the officer, employee, or official on a full-time basis, unless the assignment and use of the motor vehicle is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, inspections or audits of regulated facilities, entities, or persons, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public, or is essential, as documented in writing, for a specified period of time to the personal security of the officer, employee, or official; a driver or chauffer whose assigned full-time or part-time duties are to operate any motor vehicle in which the officer, employee, or official, or an immediate family member, is a passenger, unless the driver is a law enforcement officer who is assigned also to provide for the security of the officer, employee, or official when the need for such security has been documented; an exemption from the payment of any toll relating to the use of a State toll bridge or toll road or fare relating to the use of the transportation services of a State agency, or payment for any such toll or fare or any other travel expense for commuting between the place of residence and the place of employment or for tolls, fare, or other travel expense not directly related to the performance of duties by the officer, employee, or official; a personal line of credit or a credit card, or an allowance, stipend, subsidy, or other payment for a credit card, unless the use of a credit card is directly related and essential to the performance of those official duties of the officer, employee, or official, as documented in writing, that concern the maintenance of security for specified persons or property, law enforcement, inspections or audits of regulated facilities, entities, or persons, or the health, safety, or welfare of members of the public; or tuition reimbursement for attendance of courses at an institution of higher education, including a county college, within or outside of this State, unless the course is taken at an accredited public institution of higher education in this State, the reimbursement is limited to not more than 50 percent of the tuition for each course, the employee receives a grade of at least a C or its equivalent, for the course, the course is directly related to the skills and knowledge required for the duties being performed by the officer or employee when the reimbursement is made or required for the performance of the duties of a position to which the officer or employee may directly be promoted from the current position, and the officer and employee agrees to remain a public officer or employee for five years after the final tuition reimbursement is made.  If the officer or employee does not remain a public employee for that period of time, the officer or employee must reimburse the public entity for tuition reimbursements made with the reimbursement pro-rated for the number of years the public officer or employee remains after the final tuition reimbursement is made.  This paragraph will not apply to tuition reimbursement for a course or program that provides a certification of a skill or understanding sufficient to perform or assess a particular technological, mechanical, industrial, operational, accounting, or construction process or function, and that certification is required for holding that office or employment. Other provisions of law relevant to the matters covered in these sections would remain applicable to the extent not inconsistent.  These provisions would not be construed to preclude the imposition of additional restrictions by directive or regulation. For the matters described above, the bill defines State to mean any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of the State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission or other instrumentality within or created by such department; any independent State authority, commission, instrumentality or agency; the Offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor and the officers and employees of those offices; the Legislature of the State, and any office, board, bureau or commission within or created by the Legislative Branch; institutions of higher education of this State; and, to the extent consistent with law, any interstate agency to which New Jersey is a party.  For a violation, the officer, employee, or elected official would have to pay a civil penalty of not less than $500 nor more than $10,000 Section 16:  This section prohibits a State officer or employee or special State officer or employee, other than a member of the Legislature or such an officer or employee of the Legislature, but including the officers and employees of the Office of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, from undertaking any travel outside of the State, or within the State when it involves an overnight stay, when the expenses of that travel or the expenses incident thereto, or both, are paid in part or in whole with the public funds of a State agency unless that travel has been determined in advance by the office of the Governor to be essential to the performance of the duties of the officer or employee and approved in writing by the Governor or the Governors designee.  When the performance of the duties of an officer or employee require travel on a regular or recurring basis, the Governor may grant approval in advance for such travel, under such terms and conditions as the Governor determines, during a specified period of time not to exceed one year from the date of approval as determined by the Governor.  The bill bars an officer or employee from receiving an amount for travel and travel-related expenses in advance of the travel.  This requirement will not apply to an officer or employee for travel solely to the Philadelphia, New York City, or Wilmington metropolitan areas to meet with federal or state government officers or employees, or members of the States Congressional delegation or their officers or employees, for a period not to exceed two consecutive days, or to Washington, D.C., for the same purposes for two consecutive days. Sections 17 and 18:  These sections increase the accountability of local units of government regarding approvals and expenditures for travel by local government officers and employees.  While a 2007 law, N.J.S.A.18A:11-12, imposed stringent requirements regarding travel and expense reimbursement upon school board members and school district employees, local governments are afforded considerable discretion over authorizing and monitoring travel by local government officers and employees. These sections impose upon local governments travel restrictions and accountability measures that are substantially similar to those currently applicable to school districts.  The sections would require local governing bodies to adopt travel policies and procedures ensuring that all travel by local government officers and employees is necessary and fiscally prudent.  Local unit travel expenditures would have to be directly related to and within the scope of the officers or employee's current responsibilities, critical to the needs of the local unit or further the efficient operation of the local unit, consistent with the local unit 's professional development plan, and, except as otherwise provided in statutory law, in compliance with State travel payment guidelines established by the Department of the Treasury and the federal Office of Management and Budget. The bill provides that local units must adopt travel policies requiring: officers and employees to document the primary purpose for the travel, the key issues addressed at the event and their relevance to improving the operation of the local unit; governing bodies to maintain detailed documentation demonstrating compliance with the local unit's travel policy including travel approvals, reports, and receipts for all local unit funded expenditures; and that travel occur only upon prior written approval of the chief financial officer and prior approval of the governing body. These sections apply to the governing bodies and officers and employees of fire districts.
