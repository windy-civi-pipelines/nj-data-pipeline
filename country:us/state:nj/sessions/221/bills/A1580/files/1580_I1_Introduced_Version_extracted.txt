The commission is required to annually report to the Governor and the Legislature as to its activities, as well as its findings and recommendations for any needed new laws, services, or resources for victims of human trafficking. Recent FBI investigations reveal that some human traffickers have used popular online gaming platforms to victimize children. Based on news reports related to these investigations, predators may groom children on online gaming sites through chats or voice communications and then convince them to switch over to other social media platforms, which provides predators with greater access to information about their potential victims. Under the bill, in addition to its existing duties, the commission also is required to investigate methods by which human traffickers use video game and social media platforms to locate and abuse children and other human trafficking victims; develop solutions to prevent human trafficking through video game and social media platforms; and make recommendations for legislation to implement these solutions.
