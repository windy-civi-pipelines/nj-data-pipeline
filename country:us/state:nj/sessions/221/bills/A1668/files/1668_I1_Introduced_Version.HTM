Current law generally provides that the subject matter of the board member training is prescribed by the institutions of higher education, in consultation with the Secretary of Higher Education.  This bill provides that the secretary is to determine the subject matter of the training and that the training include the role of the governing board in the financial management of an institution of higher education.  The bill provides that, in the case of four-year public institutions of higher education, the secretary will arrange for the training; current law, by contrast, requires the institution to arrange for the training.  Public institutions of higher education also would no longer be required to conduct a periodic review of the training. The bill directs the secretary to provide notification to a governing board member who has failed to comply with the training requirement and provide the member with a 30-day grace period to fulfill the outstanding training requirement. The bill permits the secretary to provide additional extensions to the grace period. The bill provides that failure to fulfill the outstanding training requirement within the grace period may constitute a resignation from the governing board at the discretion of the secretary and a vacancy will be deemed to exist.  Under the bill, the board member will be disqualified from being reappointed to the board, or appointed to any other governing board of a public institution of higher education, for the succeeding two-year period. Additionally, the bill permits training for governing board members to be made available online. The bill further repeals a section of law that requires four-year public institutions of higher education to provide certain information, orientation, and training to each of its governing board members. Under the bill, all required training for governing board members at public institutions of higher education is to be arranged for by the secretary. Finally, the bill provides that $350,000 will be annually appropriated from the General Fund to the Office of the Secretary of Higher Education to effectuate the bills purposes.
