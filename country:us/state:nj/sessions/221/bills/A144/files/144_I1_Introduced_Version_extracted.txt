The enforcing agency in any municipality would make the decision to grant a certification that the structures qualify after receiving a written application.  The enforcing agency may inquire into the right of a claimant to the exemption and may require the filing of a new application or the submission of any proof necessary to determine the continuation of the exemption.  The enforcing agency would also have the authority to make an inspection of the premises.  The exemption for the water quality management structure would begin the tax year following the year in which certification was granted. The enforcing agency may revoke the certificate if: the certificate was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation; the claimant fails to proceed with the construction, reconstruction, installation, or acquisition of a water quality management structure; the water quality management structure to which the certificate relates is being used for a different primary purpose; or the claimant has so departed from the equipment, design, and construction previously certified by the enforcing agency that, the water quality management structure is not suitable the purposes initially intended. The bill also requires the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury to adopt rules and regulations necessary for certification of the water quality management systems, including the technical sufficiency of a water quality management system to qualify for an exemption, for the implementation of the act.
