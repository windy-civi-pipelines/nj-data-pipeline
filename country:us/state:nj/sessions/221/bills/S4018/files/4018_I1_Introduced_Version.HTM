<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  A carrier that
offers a health benefits plan in this State shall provide benefits to any
subscriber for medical expenses incurred in screening, prevention, and
treatment services of behavioral health issues in children.  A carrier shall
accept and reimburse claims for screening, prevention, and treatment using an
at-risk diagnosis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The benefits shall be
provided to the same extent as for any other service, drug, device, product, or

diagnosis made after consideration of factors influencing behavioral health and
child development, such as family circumstances or life challenges, that does
not lead to a formal mental health diagnosis and instead, promotes preventive
care.  Allowing providers to bill for an at-risk diagnosis authorizes
providers to use an alternative code, including a Social Determinants of Health
Z-code, to the codes of the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the Diagnostic Classification of
Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood, when
billing for services, without a formal mental health diagnosis, for children
who are 18 years of age or younger.</p>

medical service corporation, or health maintenance organization authorized to
issue health benefits plans in this State.</p>

to individuals with potential mental health disorders not yet diagnosed.</p>

commission on or after the effective date of this act that provides hospital
and medical expense benefits shall provide benefits to any covered person for
medical expenses incurred in the screening, prevention, and treatment services
of behavioral health issues in children.  The contract shall allow for
acceptance and reimbursement of claims for screening, prevention, and treatment
using an at-risk diagnosis.</p>
