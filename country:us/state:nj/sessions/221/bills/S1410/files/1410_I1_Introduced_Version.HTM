Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1996,
c.138 (C.18A:7F-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As used in this section,
&quot;cost of living&quot; means the CPI as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Within 30 days
following the approval of the Educational Adequacy Report, the commissioner
shall notify each district of the base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts
for full-day preschool, the weights for grade level, county vocational school
districts, at-risk pupils, bilingual pupils, and combination pupils, the cost
coefficients for security aid and for transportation aid, <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the State
average classification rate and<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
the excess cost for general special education services pupils, <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>the State
average classification rate and<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
the excess cost for speech-only pupils, and the geographic cost adjustment for
each of the school years to which the report is applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Annually, within two days
following the transmittal of the State budget message to the Legislature by the
Governor pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-20), the
commissioner shall notify each district of the maximum amount of aid payable to
the district in the succeeding school year pursuant to the provisions of
P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.), and shall notify each district of the
district's adequacy budget for the succeeding school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the 2008-2009 school year
and thereafter, unless otherwise specified within P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.), aid amounts payable for the budget year shall be based on budget year
pupil counts, which shall be projected by the commissioner using data from
prior years.  Adjustments for the actual pupil counts of the budget year shall
be made to State aid amounts payable during the school year succeeding the
budget year.  Additional amounts payable shall be reflected as revenue and an account
receivable for the budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, each district's State aid payable for
the 2008-2009 school year, with the exception of aid for school facilities
projects, shall be based on simulations employing the various formulas and
State aid amounts contained in P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.). The
commissioner shall prepare a report dated December 12, 2007 reflecting the
State aid amounts payable by category for each district and shall submit the
report to the Legislature prior to the adoption of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.).  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection and
paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-47),
the amounts contained in the commissioner's report shall be the final amounts
payable and shall not be subsequently adjusted other than to reflect the
phase-in of the required general fund local levy pursuant to paragraph (4) of
subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58) and to reflect
school choice aid to which a district may be entitled pursuant to section 20 of
that act. The projected pupil counts and equalized valuations used for the
calculation of State aid shall also be used for the calculation of adequacy
budget, local share, and required local share.  For <br>
2008-2009, extraordinary special education State aid shall be included as a
projected amount in the commissioner's report dated December 12, 2007 pending
the final approval of applications for the aid.  If the actual award of
extraordinary special education State aid is greater than the projected amount,
the district shall receive the increase in the aid payable in the subsequent
school year pursuant to the provisions of subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-55). If the actual award of extraordinary special education
State aid is less than the projected amount, other State aid categories shall
be adjusted accordingly so that the district shall not receive less State aid
than as provided in accordance with the provisions of sections 5 and 16 of
P.L.2007, c.260 <br>
(C.18A:7F-47 and C.18A:7F-58).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that the
commissioner determines, following the enactment of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-43 et al.) but prior to the issuance of State aid notices for the
2008-2009 school year, that a significant district-specific change in data
warrants an increase in State aid for that district, the commissioner may
adjust the State aid amount provided for the district in the December 12, 2007

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 2 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-44) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The Constitution of the
State of New Jersey states that the Legislature shall provide for the
maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public
schools for the instruction of all children in the State between the ages of
five and eighteen years.  (N.J. Const. art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The State, in addition
to any constitutional mandates, has a moral obligation to ensure that New
Jersey's children, wherever they reside, are provided the skills and knowledge
necessary to succeed.  Any school funding formula should provide resources in a
manner that optimizes the likelihood that children will receive an education
that will make them productive members of society. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Although the Supreme
Court of New Jersey has held that prior school funding statutes did not
establish a system of public education that was thorough and efficient as to
certain districts, the Court has consistently held that the Legislature has the
responsibility to substantively define what constitutes a thorough and
efficient system of education responsive to that constitutional requirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Every child in New
Jersey must have an opportunity for an education based on academic standards
that satisfy constitutional requirements regardless of where the child resides,
and public funds allocated to this purpose must be expended to support schools
that are thorough and efficient in delivering those educational standards.  In
turn, school districts must be assured the financial support necessary to
provide those constitutionally compelled educational standards.  Any school
funding formula should provide State aid for every school district based on the
characteristics of the student population and up-to-date measures of the
individual district's ability to pay. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     New Jersey's current
public school funding formula, established under the provisions of the
&quot;Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996,&quot;
(CEIFA) P.L.1996, c.138, has not been used to calculate State aid for public
schools since the 2001-02 school year.  Any new school funding formula should
account for changes in enrollment and other significant developments, providing
relief to those districts that have experienced substantial enrollment
increases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     The decisions in the
Abbott cases have resulted in frequent litigation and a fragmented system of
funding under which limited resources cannot be distributed equitably to all
districts where at-risk children reside, instead dividing the districts sharply
into Abbott and non-Abbott categories for funding purposes without regard to a
district's particular pupil characteristics and leading to needlessly adversarial
relationships among school districts and between districts and the State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    In the absence of a
clear, unitary, enforceable statutory formula to govern appropriations for
education, crucial funding decisions are made annually, in competition for
limited State resources with other needs and requirements as part of the annual
budget negotiation process, utilizing many different classes and categories of
aid, leading to an uncertain, unpredictable, and untenable funding situation
for the State and school districts alike.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    This act represents the
culmination of five years of diligent efforts by both the Executive and
Legislative branches of State government to develop an equitable and
predictable way to distribute State aid that addresses the deficiencies found
in past formulas as identified by the Supreme Court.  Working together toward
this common goal, the Department of Education and the Legislature engaged
nationally recognized experts in education funding and provided significant
opportunities for stakeholder involvement and public input to assist in
formulating and refining a comprehensive school funding model that has been
validated by experts.  The formula accounts for the individual characteristics
of school districts and the realities of their surroundings, including the need
for additional resources to address the increased disadvantages created by high
concentrations of children at-risk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     i.     The formula established
under this act is the product of a careful and deliberative process that first
involved determining the educational inputs necessary to provide a high-quality
education, including specifically addressing the supplemental needs of at-risk
students and those with limited English proficiency (LEP), and a determination
of the actual cost of providing those programs.  The formula provides adequate
funding that is realistically geared to the core curriculum content standards,
thus linking those standards to the actual funding needed to deliver that
content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     j.     In recognition of the
unique problems and cost disadvantages faced by districts with high
concentrations of at-risk students, it is appropriate to reflect in the formula
a greater weight as the district's proportion of at-risk students increases. 
In addition, the new formula recognizes the disadvantages of an expanded group
of students by including in the definition of at-risk those students who
qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.  Expanding the definition of at-risk
students in this manner will significantly increase the resources flowing to
districts with high concentrations of these low-income students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     k.    In light of the
demonstrable, beneficial results and success of the current Abbott preschool
program, it is appropriate to build upon this success by incorporating in the
formula an expanded high-quality preschool program for all children who qualify
for free and reduced price meals in all districts.  It is appropriate for the
formula to acknowledge that at-risk children do not always receive the same
educational exposure at an early age as their peers and to provide the
additional resources necessary through high-quality preschool to prepare every
child to learn and succeed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     l.     It is appropriate to
reflect in this formula the inherent value of educating a child in the least
restrictive environment and, whenever possible, in that child's neighborhood
school alongside his peers.  The new funding formula should provide incentives
for keeping classified students in district.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     m.   It is also appropriate to
recognize in the formula the need for all schools to incorporate effective
security measures, which may vary from district to district depending upon the
at-risk student population and other factors, and to provide categorical
funding to address these important requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     n.    <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>In recognition
of the potentially wide variability in special education costs, even for the
same category of disability, from district to district, it is appropriate for
the new funding formula to mitigate the impact of that variability by establishing
a census model based on the actual Statewide average excess cost of educating
special education students and by providing for an increase in State aid for
extraordinary costs incurred by districts.<b><span style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b>
<u>(Deleted by amendment, P.L.    , c.   ) (pending before the Legislature as
this bill)</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     o.    It is imperative that
any new school funding formula work in conjunction with the key school
accountability measures that have been enacted in recent years to promote
greater oversight, transparency, and efficiency in the delivery of educational
services.  These accountability measures include the New Jersey Quality Single
Accountability Continuum, the &quot;School District Fiscal Accountability
Act,&quot; P.L.2006, c.15 (C.18A:7A-54 et seq.), P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A:65-1 et al.)
which established the duties and responsibilities of the executive county
superintendent of schools, and P.L.2007, c.53 (C.18A:55-3 et al.).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     p.    Together with a renewed
legislative focus on and commitment to providing sufficient means to maintain
and support a high-quality system of free public schools in the State, a new
funding formula supported by significantly increased State resources will
ensure compliance with all statutory and constitutional mandates.  Districts
that were formerly designated as Abbott districts will be provided sufficient
resources to continue those Court-identified programs, positions, and services
that have proven effective while being provided the flexibility to shift
resources and programmatic focus based on the needs of their students and
current research.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     q.    The time has come for
the State to resolve the question of the level of funding required to provide a
thorough and efficient system of education for all New Jersey school children. 
The development and implementation of an equitable and adequate school funding
formula will not only ensure that the State's students have access to a
constitutional education as defined by the core curriculum content standards,
but also may help to reduce property taxes and assist communities in planning
to meet their educational expenses.  The development of a predictable,
transparent school funding formula is essential for school districts to plan
effectively and deliver the quality education that our citizens expect and our
Constitution requires.</p>

requires special education services, rather than using the actual number of
special education students to determine the amount of State aid that school
districts will receive.  This bill eliminates the use of the census-based
methodology, and calculates State aid for special education based on the actual
number of special education students included in the districts resident
enrollment.</p>
