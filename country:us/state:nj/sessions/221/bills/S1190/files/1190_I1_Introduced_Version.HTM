<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    a.  For the purposes of
this section:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commission means the Rider

Transit Office of Customer Advocate established pursuant to this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.  There is established in
the Department of Transportation the Rider Advocacy Commission.  For the
purposes of complying with the provisions of Article V, Section IV, paragraph 1
of the New Jersey Constitution, the Rider Advocacy Commission is allocated to
the Department of Transportation but, notwithstanding this allocation, the commission
shall be independent of any supervision or control by the department.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     (1) The Rider Advocacy

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. The Rider Advocate shall be
appointed by the Rider Advocacy Commission and shall report directly to the commission. 
The Rider Advocate shall have the authority to carry out the purposes of the
office to protect the interests of New Jersey Transit Corporation customers. Except
for supervision by the commission, the Rider Advocate shall not be subject to
any supervision or control by the Commissioner of Transportation, the board of

may on a temporary basis retain such expert assistants as are necessary to
protect the interests of corporation customers, pursuant to a reasonable fee
established in advance by the State Treasurer for the compensation paid to
expert assistants.  For the purposes of this subsection, exceptional
circumstances includes, but is not limited to, any instance in which the
corporation experiences a planned or actual fare increase, a substantial
curtailment of service, a significant expansion of service, or a major
operating or capital expenditure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    The responsibilities of
the New Jersey Transit Office of Customer Advocate shall be to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  provide information and
analysis to the board of directors of the corporation, the Governor, and the
Legislature concerning the actual or anticipated impact of any actions by the
corporation or the board of the corporation on the corporations customers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  provide customer input
and feedback to the board of directors of the corporation, the Governor, and
the Legislature, including relaying the needs and concerns of customers to the
board of directors of the corporation, the Governor, and the Legislature; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  represent the interests
of the corporations customers as determined by the Rider Advocate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    The New Jersey Transit
Office of Customer Advocate may conduct investigations; initiate studies;
conduct research; present comments and testimony before the board of directors
of the corporation, legislative committees, and other governmental bodies; prepare
and issue reports; and undertake any other actions that further the purposes of
the office.  The office shall allow public input concerning the operations of
the corporation and customer experiences to be submitted, at any time, through
the offices official Internet website and through voicemail.  The office shall
conduct at least one meeting per month with customers of the corporation and
shall allow for a remote attendance option, for the purpose of relaying the
concerns and needs of customers to the board of directors of the corporation and,
when the Rider Advocate deems it appropriate, to the executive management team
of the corporation.  The meetings shall also provide information to customers regarding
any major actions of the corporation or the board of the corporation for which
the Rider Advocate has knowledge.  </p>

follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)    upon publication of any

proposal to substantially curtail service, the corporation shall immediately make
available to the office all information and documents concerning the proposal
so that the office may review those documents and prepare an analysis of the

to the board of directors of the corporation, the Governor, and the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes a Rider
Advocacy Commission (commission) in, but not of, the Department of
Transportation and requires the commission to establish a New Jersey Transit
Office of Customer Advocate (office).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Similar to the New York City
Transit Riders Council, also known as the New York City Transit Authority
Advisory Council, which&#8239;was created by the New York State Legislature in
1981 to represent New York City subway and bus riders, and users of the Staten
Island Railway, the office is to investigate, monitor, advocate, promote, and
advise on all customer-experience matters pertaining to the operation of the
New Jersey Transit Corporation (NJT). The commission is to consist of three
members, one member appointed by the Governor, one member appointed by the
President of the Senate, and one member appointed by the Speaker of the General
Assembly. Each member is limited to a five-year term, except that of the
members first appointed, the member appointed by the Governor is to be
appointed for a one-year term, the member appointed by the President of the
Senate is to be appointed for a two-year term, and the member appointed by the
Speaker of the General Assembly is to be appointed for a three-year term. The
commission is empowered to engage and dismiss staff as necessary, including the
appointment of a Rider Advocate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Rider Advocate is the head
of the office, is required to report directly to the commission, and has the
authority to carry out the purposes of the office, including, with the approval
of the commission, temporarily retaining expert assistants as are necessary to
protect the interests of NJT customers when exceptional circumstances arise.
The responsibilities of the office include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  providing information and
analysis to the NJT board of directors, Governor, and Legislature concerning
the actual or anticipated impact of any NJT board or NJT actions on NJTs
customers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  providing customer input
and feedback to the NJT board, Governor, and Legislature, including relaying
the needs and concerns of customers to the NJT board, Governor, and
Legislature; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  representing the
interests of NJTs customers as determined by the Rider Advocate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The office has the authority
to conduct investigations; initiate studies; conduct research; present comments
and testimony before the NJT board of directors, legislative committees, and
other governmental bodies; prepare and issue reports; and undertake any other
actions that further the purposes of the office.  The office is also required
to conduct meetings with NJT customers, which are to occur at least on a
monthly basis, and would allow for a remote attendance option, for the purpose
of relaying the concerns and needs of customers to the NJT board of directors
and, when the Rider Advocate deems appropriate, to the executive management
team of NJT.  In addition, the office would also be required to allow for
public input on NJT operations and experiences at any time, through the
offices official Internet website and through voicemail.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The office is also required to
represent the interests of NJTs customers in areas such as proposed fare
increases, proposed substantial curtailment of services, and any proposed
expansion of service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Funds for the expenses of the
commission and office are to be provided by the State Treasurer, as
appropriated by the Legislature, and are to be independent of funds for the
NJT.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     On or before March 31 of each
year, the commission in consultation with the Rider Advocate is required to
prepare and submit a report to the Governor and Legislature on the activities
of the commission and office for the previous calendar year, including any
reports provided to the NJT board of directors.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill repeals a provision
of law requiring NJT to employ a customer advocate.</p>
