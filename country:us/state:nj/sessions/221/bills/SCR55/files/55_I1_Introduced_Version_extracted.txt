The surviving spouse of a deceased citizen and resident of the State who during his or her life received a deduction pursuant to this paragraph shall be entitled, so long as he or she shall remain unmarried and a resident of the same dwelling house situated on the same land with respect to which said deduction was granted, to the same deduction, upon the same conditions, with respect to the same real property or with respect to the same dwelling house which is situated on land owned by another or others, or with respect to the same cooperative or mutual housing corporation, notwithstanding that said surviving spouse is under the age of 65 and is not permanently and totally disabled, provided that said surviving spouse is 55 years of age or older.

INTERPRETIVE STATEMENT NO Currently the Constitution limits to $10,000 the amount of income that can be earned annually in order to qualify for the senior and disabled property tax deduction. This amendment will increase the annual income limit to $15,000, beginning in 2023. The income limit was last increased in 1983, from $9,000 to $10,000. STATEMENT This concurrent resolution proposes a constitutional amendment authorizing an increase from $10,000 to $15,000 in the annual income limitation for eligibility to receive the annual senior and disabled property tax deduction.  The change to the income limitation would take effect in 2023. In order to qualify for this deduction, a senior citizen must be 65 years of age or older, and have an annual income that does not exceed the Constitutional income limit (currently $10,000).  A person who is permanently and totally disabled does not need to meet an age requirement, but does need to meet the Constitutional income limit. The annual income limit has not been increased since 1983, when the States voters approved an increase from $9,000 per year to the current $10,000 per year.
