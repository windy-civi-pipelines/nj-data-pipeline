amending various parts of the statutory law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 5 of P.L.1996,
c.138 (C.18A:7F-5) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    As used in this section,
&quot;cost of living&quot; means the CPI as defined in section 3 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-45).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Within 30 days
following the approval of the Educational Adequacy Report, the commissioner
shall notify each district of the base per pupil amount, the per pupil amounts
for full-day preschool, the weights for grade level, county vocational school
districts, at-risk pupils, bilingual pupils, and combination pupils, the cost
coefficients for security aid and for transportation aid, the State average
classification rate and the excess cost for general special education services
pupils, the State average classification rate and the excess cost for speech-only
pupils, and the geographic cost adjustment for each of the school years to
which the report is applicable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Annually, within two days
following the transmittal of the State budget message to the Legislature by the
Governor pursuant to section 11 of P.L.1944, c.112 (C.52:27B-20), the
commissioner shall notify each district of the maximum amount of aid payable to
the district in the succeeding school year pursuant to the provisions of
P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.), and shall notify each district of the
district's adequacy budget for the succeeding school year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For the 2008-2009 school year
and thereafter, unless otherwise specified within P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.), aid amounts payable for the budget year shall be based on budget year
pupil counts, which shall be projected by the commissioner using data from
prior years.  Adjustments for the actual pupil counts of the budget year shall
be made to State aid amounts payable during the school year succeeding the
budget year.  Additional amounts payable shall be reflected as revenue and an
account receivable for the budget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Notwithstanding any other
provision of this act to the contrary, each district's State aid payable for
the 2008-2009 school year, with the exception of aid for school facilities
projects, shall be based on simulations employing the various formulas and
State aid amounts contained in P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43 et al.).  The
commissioner shall prepare a report dated December 12, 2007 reflecting the
State aid amounts payable by category for each district and shall submit the
report to the Legislature prior to the adoption of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.).  Except as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection and
paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 5 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-47),
the amounts contained in the commissioner's report shall be the final amounts
payable and shall not be subsequently adjusted other than to reflect the
phase-in of the required general fund local levy pursuant to paragraph (4) of
subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58) and to reflect
school choice aid to which a district may be entitled pursuant to section 20 of
that act. The projected pupil counts and equalized valuations used for the
calculation of State aid shall also be used for the calculation of adequacy
budget, local share, and required local share.  For 2008-2009, extraordinary
special education State aid shall be included as a projected amount in the
commissioner's report dated December 12, 2007 pending the final approval of
applications for the aid.  If the actual award of extraordinary special
education State aid is greater than the projected amount, the district shall
receive the increase in the aid payable in the subsequent school year pursuant
to the provisions of subsection c. of section 13 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-55). If the actual award of extraordinary special education State aid
is less than the projected amount, other State aid categories shall be adjusted
accordingly so that the district shall not receive less State aid than as
provided in accordance with the provisions of sections 5 and 16 of P.L.2007,
c.260 (C.18A:7F-47 and C.18A:7F-58).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the event that the
commissioner determines, following the enactment of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-43
et al.) but prior to the issuance of State aid notices for the 2008-2009 school
year, that a significant district-specific change in data warrants an increase
in State aid for that district, the commissioner may adjust the State aid
amount provided for the district in the December 12, 2007 report to reflect the
increase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Each district shall have
a required local share.  For districts that receive educational adequacy aid
pursuant to subsection b. of section 16 of P.L.2007, c.260 (C.18A:7F-58), the
required local share shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of
that subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     For all other districts, the
required local share shall equal the lesser of the local share calculated at
the district's adequacy budget pursuant to section 9 of P.L.2007, c.260
(C.18A:7F-51), or the district's budgeted local share for the prebudget year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to meet this

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill will return to
voters residing in school districts in which the annual school election has
been moved to November the right to approve or disapprove the districts base
budget.  Under the provisions of this bill, a voter at the November school
election will have the right to vote on the same matters that are presented to
a voter at an April school election.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of this
bill, a school district with a November school election will continue to submit
its budget to the commissioner by March 20, except that this budget will be a
temporary budget for the upcoming school year.  As current law provides, the
secretary of the board of education by May 19 will certify the amount fixed and
determined by the school board to the county board of taxation and the amount
certified will be included in the taxes levied and collected in the
municipality or municipalities comprising the district.  If the voters approve
the budget at the November school election, the temporary budget will be the final
budget for the district for that school year.  If the voters disapprove the
budget, the budget will be submitted to the governing body of each of the
municipalities included within the district for determination of the amount
that should be expended notwithstanding voter rejection, as is the process
under current law for defeated school budgets.  If under this process the
general fund tax levy of the district is reduced, or if the voters in November fail
to approve any separate proposal on the ballot to spend above cap, then the
secretary of the board of education will re-certify to the county board of
taxation the sum or sums to be raised for that school year.</p>
