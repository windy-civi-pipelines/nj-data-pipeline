licenses to qualifying smart growth municipalities, supplementing Title 33 of
the Revised Statues, and amending and repealing parts of P.L.2007, c.351.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section) The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Smart growth is an
innovative approach to land use planning that directs the States resources and
funding to projects that enhance the quality of life for New Jersey residents;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Smart growth encourages
the development of distinctive, attractive communities with mixed use
development, walkable town centers and neighborhoods, a range of housing
options, and a variety of transportation modes;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Small businesses,
including restaurants and other establishments that serve alcoholic beverages,
enhance the economic viability of a smart growth community and the quality of
life for residents and visitors;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Under current law, a
municipality may not issue a new plenary retail consumption license unless and
until the combined total number of such licenses existing in the municipality
is fewer than one for each 3,000 of its population according to the most recent
estimates issued by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, and liquor licenses issued
in one municipality may not be transferred to another municipality;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     As a result of these
restrictions, there is an insufficient number or complete lack of available
plenary retail consumption licenses in many smart growth communities where real
estate development projects including restaurants have been proposed; at the
same time, there are numerous other municipalities that have a surplus of
inactive plenary retail consumption licenses in excess of any foreseeable
demand for those licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     In order to foster and
encourage development in smart growth communities in which there is an
insufficient number or complete lack of available plenary retail consumption
licenses, it is appropriate  to create a method for the sale and transfer of
inactive plenary retail consumption licenses existing in those communities
having a surplus of inactive licenses to purchasers who will activate and utilize
such licenses in smart growth communities, and to provide financial
compensation to the municipalities from which such licenses are transferred.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    (New section) a.  As
used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Green building conversion
redevelopment project means any redevelopment project that includes the
conversion of not less than 150,000 square feet of existing office or other
commercial premises, that is vacant or functionally obsolete and at least 35
years old, into Class A office or other commercial premises satisfying the
requirements for the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green
Building Rating System as adopted by the United States Green Building Council.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Inactive license means a
plenary retail consumption license that has been renewed as authorized by the
provisions of R.S.33:1-12.39 for more than three license terms and for which
the holder of the license certifies that he has not received any viable,
reasonable, or acceptable offers to purchase and no location at which to
activate the license within the issuing municipality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Qualifying smart growth
municipality means a municipality that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1) is located in a smart
growth area; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2) is not authorized to issue
any new plenary retail consumption licenses because of the limitation on the number
of plenary retail consumption licenses in section 2 of P.L.1947, c.94
(C33:1-12.14), excluding plenary retail consumption licenses transferred
pursuant to this act; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3) is unable to issue a
sufficient number of new plenary retail consumption licenses to satisfy the
anticipated demand for plenary retail consumption licenses to be utilized
within a real estate development project, as determined by the director
pursuant to subsection c. of this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Real estate development
project means any building or complex of buildings, whether or not under
common ownership or control, which is the subject of a common redevelopment
plan, site plan, general development plan, or other land use plan approved by
the qualifying smart growth municipality in which it is located.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Sending municipality means a
municipality that has one or more inactive plenary retail consumption licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Smart growth area means a
Planning Area 1 (Metropolitan), Planning Area 2 (Suburban), or a designated
center or designated growth center in an endorsed plan; a smart growth area and
planning area designated in a master plan adopted by the New Jersey Meadowlands
Commission pursuant to subsection (i) of section 6 of P.L.1968, c.404
(C.13:17-6); a growth area designated in the comprehensive management plan
adopted pursuant to section 7 of the Pinelands Protection Act, P.L.1979,
c.111 (C.13:18A-8); any area designated for growth in the Highlands regional
master plan adopted by the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Council pursuant
to P.L.2004, c.120 (C.13:20-1 et al.); a transit village; an urban enterprise
zone designated pursuant to P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et seq.) or P.L.2001,
c.347 (C.52:27H-66.2 et al.); an area determined to be in need of redevelopment
or rehabilitation pursuant to P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.) and as
approved by the Department of Community Affairs; any area on which a green
building conversion redevelopment project is located; and federally owned land
approved for closure under a federal Base Realignment Closing Commission
action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    An inactive license
which has been issued by a sending municipality may, in accordance with the

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the provisions of this
bill, an inactive plenary retail consumption license may be purchased by: (1) a
corporation or other legal entity operating or intending to operate a
restaurant or bar in a qualifying smart growth municipality; or (2) the owner
of a real estate development project in a qualifying smart growth municipality,
provided that the inactive license would be transferred to a restaurant or bar
in the real estate development project.  The bill repeals sections 1 and 2 of
P.L.2007, c.351 (C.33:1-24.1 and 33:1-24.2) which permit the Director of the
Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) to issue special permits for the
service of alcoholic beverages in smart growth development projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill first requires the
Director of the ABC to determine whether an inactive license may be transferred
to a qualifying smart growth municipality.  The director is required to approve
the transfer if the municipality is unable to issue a sufficient number of new
plenary retail consumption licenses to satisfy the anticipated demand for such
licenses in a real estate development project because of the statutory
limitation on the number of plenary retail consumption licenses (currently one
for every 3,000 members of the population).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     After a contract for the sale
of a license has been signed, the seller is required to obtain resolutions
adopted by the issuing authorities of the sending municipality and the
qualifying smart growth municipality.  The resolution adopted by the sending
municipality must consent to the transfer of the license to the qualifying
smart growth municipality.  The resolution adopted by the issuing authority of
the qualifying smart growth municipality must state that the municipality
wishes to acquire the license and that it will be administered in the same
manner as other plenary retail consumption licenses and in accordance with all
applicable municipal ordinances.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the
purchaser to pay to the sending municipality prior to the transfer of the
license a fee equal to twenty times the annual renewal fee for a plenary retail
consumption license in the sending municipality.  The fee is to be distributed
in the following manner: (1) twenty-five percent is to be paid to the sending
municipality; (2) twenty-five percent is to be paid to the director; and (3)
fifty percent is to be divided equally among and paid to the holders of plenary
retail consumption licensees in the qualifying smart growth municipality.  The
bill requires the purchaser to pay the qualifying smart growth municipality the
fee or fees required for the transfer of a plenary retail consumption license
as well as the annual renewal fee, prorated to the next June 30, the annual
date of renewal for all retail licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A license purchased pursuant
to the provisions of the bill may only be transferred to a premises located
within the same real estate development project.  A license may be transferred
to a corporation or other legal entity that operates a bar or restaurant in the
same real estate development project or to the owner of the real estate
development project.  The bill requires the Director of the ABC
to assign a distinctive designation for the license number, after the initial
transfer of the license, in order to identify the license as being restricted
and subject to the provisions of this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill prohibits the
director from issuing a special concessionaire permit for any location or
premises which is eligible to obtain a license to serve alcoholic beverages
under this bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill amends
section 3 of P.L.2007, c.351 (C.33:1-24.3) which provides that a municipality
containing an urban enterprise zone or a Planning Area 1 (Metropolitan) may
acquire by purchase any existing plenary retail consumption licenses within the
municipality that are inactive and retain them for up to five years.  Under
this bill, the municipality must acquire the license by purchase and the
license must be inactive for more than three years.  The bill also clarifies
that the municipality may retain the inactive licenses notwithstanding that the
Director of ABC has not issued a special ruling and the license holder has not
paid the annual license renewal fees.  The bill further amends current law to
provide that a municipality may have a public sale of an inactive plenary
retail consumption license for use only at a licensed premises in a real estate
development project within a qualifying smart growth municipality as defined in
the bill.</p>
