This bill requires the department to conduct subsequent technological stress test analyses every 15 years next following the completion of the initial analysis with the goal of adjusting, as needed, the proposals generated by the initial analysis. Under the bill, subsequently to the initial Information Technology stress test analysis, the department shall adopt a telecommuting or telework program to be applied consistently throughout the department.  The program shall require the department, in exercising its discretion, to consider an employee request to engage in telecommuting in relation to the agencys operating and service needs. The bill defines stress test as a process of determining the ability of a computer, network, program, or device to maintain a certain level of effectiveness under unfavorable conditions, and telecommuting program or telework program as a written program containing specific criteria or procedures for promoting and encouraging telecommuting or teleworking during a national or State emergency.
