duration of authority.  Any person who holds a valid permit to carry a handgun
issued pursuant to this section shall be authorized to carry a handgun in all
parts of this State, except as prohibited by subsection e. of N.J.S.2C:39-5. 
One permit shall be sufficient for all handguns owned by the holder thereof,
but the permit shall apply only to a handgun carried by the actual and legal
holder of the permit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     All permits to carry handguns
shall expire two years from the date of issuance or, in the case of an employee
of an armored car company, upon termination of his employment by the company occurring
prior thereto whichever is earlier in time, and they may thereafter be renewed
every two years in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as in the
case of original applications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Application forms.  All
applications for permits to carry handguns, and all applications for renewal of
permits, shall be made on the forms prescribed by the superintendent.  Each
application shall set forth the full name, date of birth, sex, residence,
occupation, place of business or employment, and physical description of the
applicant, and any other information the superintendent may prescribe for the
determination of the applicant's eligibility for a permit and for the proper
enforcement of this chapter.  The application shall be signed by the applicant
under oath, and shall be indorsed by three reputable persons who have known the
applicant for at least three years preceding the date of application, and who
shall certify thereon that the applicant is a person of good moral character

The chief police officer, or the superintendent, as the case may be, shall
cause the fingerprints of the applicant to be taken and compared with any and
all records maintained by the municipality, the county in which it is located,
the State Bureau of Identification and the Federal Bureau of Identification. 
He shall also determine and record a complete description of each handgun the
applicant intends to carry.</p>

existence of any specific threats or previous attacks by reference to reports
of the incidents to the appropriate law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the application is not

present it to the Superior Court of the county in which the applicant resides,
or to the Superior Court in any county where he intends to carry a handgun, in
the case of a nonresident or employee of an armored car company.  The court
shall issue the permit to the applicant if, but only if, it is satisfied that
the applicant is a person of good character who is not subject to any of the
disabilities set forth in subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:58-3, that he is thoroughly
familiar with the safe handling and use of handguns, and that he has a
justifiable need to carry a handgun in accordance with the provisions of
subsection c. of this section.  The court may at its discretion issue a
limited-type permit which would restrict the applicant as to the types of
handguns he may carry and where and for what purposes the handguns may be
carried.  At the time of issuance, the applicant shall pay to the county clerk
of the county where the permit was issued a permit fee of <b><span

applications.  Any person aggrieved by the denial by the chief police officer
or the superintendent of approval for a permit to carry a handgun may request a
hearing in the Superior Court of the county in which he resides or in any
county in which he intends to carry a handgun, in the case of a nonresident, by
filing a written request for a hearing within 30 days of the denial.  Copies of
the request shall be served upon the superintendent, the county prosecutor, and
the chief police officer of the municipality where the applicant resides, if he
is a resident of this State.  The hearing shall be held within 30 days of the
filing of the request, and no formal pleading or filing fee shall be required. 
Appeals from the determination at the hearing shall be in accordance with law
and the rules governing the courts of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     If the superintendent or chief
police officer approves an application and the Superior Court denies the
application and refuses to issue a permit, the applicant may appeal the denial
in accordance with law and the rules governing the courts of this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     Revocation of permits. 
Any permit issued under this section shall be void at the time the holder
thereof becomes subject to any of the disabilities set forth in subsection c.
of N.J.S.2C:58-3, and the holder of a void permit shall immediately surrender
the permit to the superintendent who shall give notice to the licensing
authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any permit may be revoked by
the Superior Court, after hearing upon notice to the holder, if the court finds
that the holder is no longer qualified for the issuance of a permit.  The
county prosecutor of any county, the chief police officer of any municipality,
the superintendent, or any citizen may apply to the court at any time for the
revocation of any permit issued pursuant to this section.</p>

purchase a handgun, and permits to carry a handgun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current law, the
one-time application fee for a firearms purchaser identification card is $5. 
This bill increases that fee to $100.  The $2 application fee for a permit to
purchase a handgun for each handgun purchased is increased to $50 under the
bill.  Finally, the $20 fee for the initial application for a permit to carry a
handgun and subsequent two-year renewals of the permit is increased to $200.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     According to the sponsor, fees
for firearms permits have not been changed since the 1960s and therefore, the
increases in the fees set forth in the bill are warranted. </p>
