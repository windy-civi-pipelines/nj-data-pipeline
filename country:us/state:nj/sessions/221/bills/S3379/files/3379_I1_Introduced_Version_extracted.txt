Section 1:
S3379 SENATE, No. 3379 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED JUNE 3, 2024 Sponsored by: Senator  JOSEPH F. VITALE District 19 (Middlesex) SYNOPSIS Establishes gross income tax credit for cost of certain postage for sending goods to members of United States Armed Forces and National Guard who are serving their country away from home. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act establishing a gross income tax credit for the cost of certain postage incurred in sending goods to members of the United States Armed Forces and the National Guard who are serving their country away from home, and supplementing chapter 4 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    a.  A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax otherwise due for the taxable year under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., in an amount equal to the amount the taxpayer expended in the taxable year on United States Postal Service postage to send parcels as priority mail to an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard at a military installation within or outside of the United States. b.    The amount of the credit allowed pursuant to this section shall be applied against the tax otherwise due under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J.S.54A:1-1 et seq., after all other credits and payments.  If the credit exceeds the amount of tax liability otherwise due, that amount of excess shall be an overpayment for the purposes of N.J.S.54A:9-7, provided, however, that subsection f. of N.J.S.54A:9-7 shall not apply. 2.    This act shall take effect immediately and section 1 shall apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1 next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill establishes a gross income tax credit for the amount of postage taxpayers pay the United States Postal Service to send parcels as priority mail to individuals serving in the Armed Forces of the United States or the National Guard at military installations in the United States or abroad. Homesickness frequently befalls members of the Armed Forces and the National Guard while serving their country afield.  To boost their morale, many send military personnel packages with cherished items from back home.  The cost of postage can strain the ability of the home front to take care of those stationed or deployed afield. In allowing a tax credit for certain postage expenses, this bill removes a cost-prohibitive deterrent to sending goods of appreciation and caring to loved ones serving away from home.
