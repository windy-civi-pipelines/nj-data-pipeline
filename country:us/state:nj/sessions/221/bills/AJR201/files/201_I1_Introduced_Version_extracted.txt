AJR201 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 201 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED OCTOBER 21, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblywoman  MARGIE DONLON, M.D. District 11 (Monmouth) Assemblywoman  SHANIQUE SPEIGHT District 29 (Essex and Hudson) SYNOPSIS Designates last full week of September of each year as Frontotemporal Degeneration Awareness Week in NJ. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week in New Jersey. Whereas, Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), or frontotemporal degeneration, refers to a group of disorders caused by progressive nerve cell loss in the brains frontal lobes or temporal lobes; and Whereas, FTD is a terminal and incurable neurodegenerative disease that causes impairments to speech, personality, behavior, and motor skills; and Whereas, FTD accounts for an estimated five to 15 percent of all dementia cases; and Whereas, FTD is the most common form of dementia in individuals under 60; and Whereas, On average, it takes about 3.6 years from the onset of FTD symptoms to receive an accurate diagnosis; and Whereas, The average life expectancy for someone with FTD is typically between seven and 13 years from the onset of symptoms; and Whereas, FTD can affect individuals between the ages of 21 and 80, with the highest proportion of cases occurring between 45 and 64. This often leaves people in the prime of life unable to work or function normally; and Whereas, FTD can be misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease but unlike Alzheimers disease, FTD tends to occur at a younger age; and Whereas, The average annual cost of care for a person living with FTD is roughly twice as high as the cost associated with Alzheimers disease; and Whereas, FTD is recognized as a priority disease in The National Plan to Address Alzheimers Disease; and Whereas, The National Plan to Address Alzheimers Disease is a federal strategy that aims to reduce the burden of Alzheimers disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) by accelerating research towards treatments, improving care and support for people facing these conditions, and reducing the risk of AD/ADRD by promoting brain health; and Whereas, Approximately 40 percent of individuals living with FTD have a family history of the disease or a related condition like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Of those with a family history, about half have an inherited form rare genetic mutations; and Whereas, Due to its broad range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms, FTD is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric condition or another neurodegenerative disease; and Whereas, FTD frequently impairs a persons ability to express emotions, demonstrate empathy, and show affection toward loved ones; and Whereas, An individual living with FTD may lose their sense of social propriety and experience significant changes in their personality. They might also struggle with understanding grammar, lose the meaning of words, become hesitant in their speech, and may eventually become mute; and Whereas, A person living with FTD may experience physical changes such as muscle weakness which can lead to loss of balance and increased falls.  They may also experience difficulty speaking and swallowing; and Whereas, The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration is the leading national organization exclusively focused on the spectrum of FTD disorders with a mission to improve the quality of life of people affected by FTD and promote research in effort to find a cure; and Whereas, Further research at both the national and global level is needed to enhance our understanding of FTD; and Whereas, In New Jersey there are an estimated 185,000 people living with Alzheimers dementia.  It is unknown how many New Jerseyans are living with FTD; and Whereas, Increasing FTD awareness through public events focused on the impact that FTD has on communities is key to informing New Jerseyans of this often overlooked and incurable terminal neurodegenerative medical condition; and Whereas, Designating the last full week of September as Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week would provide New Jerseyans with an annual reminder on the effects that FTD has on New Jerseyans diagnosed with the medical condition; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  The last full week of September of each year shall be designated as Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week in New Jersey to bring awareness to Frontotemporal dementia and its effect on New Jerseyans diagnosed with the medical condition. 2.  The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing the last full week of September as Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week in New Jersey, and calling upon public officials and the citizens of this State to observe the month with appropriate activities and programs. 3. This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates the last full week of September of each year as Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week in New Jersey.

Research at both the national and global level is needed to enhance our understanding of FTD and ultimately discover a cure.  In New Jersey there are an estimated 185,000 people living with Alzheimers dementia.  It is unknown how many New Jerseyans are living with FTD.  Increasing FTD awareness through public events focused on the impact that FTD has on communities is key to informing New Jerseyans of this often overlooked and incurable terminal neurodegenerative medical condition.  Designating the last full week of September as Frontotemporal Dementia Awareness Week would provide New Jerseyans with an annual reminder on the effects that FTD has on New Jerseyans diagnosed with FTD.
