(cf: P.L.1981, c.290, s.41) 4.    Section 2 of P.L.2015, c.144 (C.2C:45-6) is amended to read as follows: 2.    a.  The Administrative Director of the Courts shall establish a program to record and analyze the recidivism of all persons sentenced to a period of probation pursuant to N.J.S.2C:43-2 and N.J.S.2C:45-1 et seq.

(cf: P.L.2001, c.141, s.5) 7.    Section 17 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.61) is amended to read as follows: 17.  a.  If the parole officer assigned to supervise a parolee has probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated a condition of his parole, such violation not being a basis for return to custody pursuant to subsection b. or c. of section 16 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60), the officer may require that the parolee appear before a designated representative of the board for a review of the parolee's adjustment. b.    If the board's designated representative finds that a parolee has violated a condition of his parole, such violation not being a basis for return to custody pursuant to subsection b. or c. of section 16 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60), the designated representative may subject the parolee to one or [both] more of the actions set forth in subsection a. of section 16 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.60). c.    A parolee or the parolee's assigned parole officer may apply to the board's designated representative for modification of the conditions of parole. d.    Any action to modify the conditions of parole and any forfeiture of commutation time credits or reduction in term based on compliance pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.

(cf: P.L.1995, c.280, s.41) 8.    Section 3 of P.L.2009, c.329 (C.30:4-91.15) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  The Commissioner of Corrections, in conjunction with the Juvenile Justice Commission and the State Parole Board, shall establish a program to record and analyze the recidivism of all inmates and juveniles adjudicated delinquent who are released from a State correctional facility or a training school for juveniles, whether on parole or upon the completion of their maximum sentences.  The purpose of this program shall be to assist in measuring the effectiveness of the State's reentry initiatives and programs. b.    The program shall record the arrests for all offenses committed by releasees within three years following their release and any convictions resulting from the arrests.  These data shall be analyzed to determine whether the rates and nature of rearrests and convictions differ according to the criminal histories and personal characteristics of releasees, the treatment they received while confined, length of sentence, conditions of parole, participation and involvement in reentry initiatives and programs, the earlier discharge of releasees pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and such other factors as may be relevant to the purposes of this section, including, but not limited to, race, gender, ethnicity, and age. c.    The commissioner shall prepare and disseminate semi-annual reports summarizing the recidivism rates, patterns, and other findings and analyses resultant of the information gathered pursuant to this section. These reports shall include summaries of the treatment received by the releasees and any participation and involvement in reentry initiatives by the releasees, and shall make recommendations concerning the effectiveness of the treatment programs and reentry initiatives.  These reports shall be available to the general public and shall not contain any personally identifying information.  To facilitate the accessibility of these reports to the general public, the commissioner shall, to the greatest extent possible, utilize the Internet. d.    The commissioner shall annually prepare and transmit to the Governor and the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), a summary of the recommendations set forth in the reports prepared pursuant to subsection c. of this section, along with any recommendations the department, Juvenile Justice Commission or the State Parole Board may have for legislation to improve the effectiveness of the State's reentry initiatives and programs. (cf: P.L.2015, c.144, s.1) 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides for a reduction in a defendants suspended sentence, sentence of probation, or parole based on the defendants compliance with the conditions of the sentence.  The bill also requires studies and annual reports on recidivism that are required under current law to include data on the effect these reductions have on recidivism. The bill is modeled on a Missouri law which grants a sentence reduction through earned compliance credits to certain probationers and parolees as a reward for compliance with the terms of probation or parole.  This law has resulted in an average reduction of a supervisory sentence by 14 months.  It is the sponsors intent to provide similar incentives in New Jersey for compliance with the terms of a suspended sentence or a sentence of probation or parole, and to enable a person to reenter society more quickly. Under current law, an earlier discharge from a period of probation may be granted to a defendant on application of a probation officer, the defendant, or the courts own motion.  Under the bill, a defendants term of suspension or period of probation will be reduced as a result of a defendants compliance with the conditions of the suspension or probation.  The bill provides that the period of suspension or probation will be reduced by 30 days for each full calendar month the defendant is in compliance with the conditions of suspension or probation. Currently, the Administrative Director of the Courts is required to record and analyze data concerning the recidivism of those sentenced to a period of probation, and prepare and transmit an annual report on the effectiveness of the State's rehabilitation initiatives and programs.  This bill requires the Administrative Director also to consider how a reduction in the period of suspension or probation under the bill affects recidivism rates. Under current law, a parolee may be granted a complete discharge from parole prior to the expiration of the full maximum term, provided: 1) the parolee has made a satisfactory adjustment while on parole; 2) that continued supervision is not required; and 3) the parolee has made full payment of any fine or restitution required.  Under the bill, a parolee who is in compliance with the terms of supervision also would be entitled to have the term of supervision reduced by 30 days for each full calendar month the parolee is in compliance. Under current law, the Commissioner of Corrections, in conjunction with the Juvenile Justice Commission and the State Parole Board, is required to record and analyze recidivism data and issue an annual report regarding the effectiveness of the State's reentry initiatives and programs.  The provisions of the bill require the data and report also to include information on parolees who receive an earlier discharge under the bill. The bill provides that a person who has been sentenced to a special sentence of community supervision for life or parole supervision for life; or a parolee who has been convicted of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child pursuant to subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, endangering the welfare of a child pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4; luring or enticing pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.291 (C.2C:13-6); kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, criminal restraint pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-2, or false imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-3 if the victim is a minor and the offender is not the parent of the victim; knowingly promoting prostitution of a child pursuant to paragraphs (3) or (4) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:34-1; or an attempt to commit any of these offenses is not eligible to receive a reduction in the period of suspension, probation, or parole under the bill. With regard to a reduced term of suspension or probation under the bill, compliance is defined as the absence of a violation of a condition of suspension or probation as set forth in N.J.S.2C:45-1.  With regard to an earlier discharge from parole under the bill, compliance is defined as the absence of a violation of the conditions of parole as set forth under subsection b. of section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59).  The appropriate board panel shall review a parolees compliance and eligibility to receive a reduction under this section at least once every six months.

(cf: P.L.2015, c.144, s.1) 9.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month following enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides for a reduction in a defendants suspended sentence, sentence of probation, or parole based on the defendants compliance with the conditions of the sentence.  The bill also requires studies and annual reports on recidivism that are required under current law to include data on the effect these reductions have on recidivism. The bill is modeled on a Missouri law which grants a sentence reduction through earned compliance credits to certain probationers and parolees as a reward for compliance with the terms of probation or parole.  This law has resulted in an average reduction of a supervisory sentence by 14 months.  It is the sponsors intent to provide similar incentives in New Jersey for compliance with the terms of a suspended sentence or a sentence of probation or parole, and to enable a person to reenter society more quickly. Under current law, an earlier discharge from a period of probation may be granted to a defendant on application of a probation officer, the defendant, or the courts own motion.  Under the bill, a defendants term of suspension or period of probation will be reduced as a result of a defendants compliance with the conditions of the suspension or probation.  The bill provides that the period of suspension or probation will be reduced by 30 days for each full calendar month the defendant is in compliance with the conditions of suspension or probation. Currently, the Administrative Director of the Courts is required to record and analyze data concerning the recidivism of those sentenced to a period of probation, and prepare and transmit an annual report on the effectiveness of the State's rehabilitation initiatives and programs.  This bill requires the Administrative Director also to consider how a reduction in the period of suspension or probation under the bill affects recidivism rates. Under current law, a parolee may be granted a complete discharge from parole prior to the expiration of the full maximum term, provided: 1) the parolee has made a satisfactory adjustment while on parole; 2) that continued supervision is not required; and 3) the parolee has made full payment of any fine or restitution required.  Under the bill, a parolee who is in compliance with the terms of supervision also would be entitled to have the term of supervision reduced by 30 days for each full calendar month the parolee is in compliance. Under current law, the Commissioner of Corrections, in conjunction with the Juvenile Justice Commission and the State Parole Board, is required to record and analyze recidivism data and issue an annual report regarding the effectiveness of the State's reentry initiatives and programs.  The provisions of the bill require the data and report also to include information on parolees who receive an earlier discharge under the bill. The bill provides that a person who has been sentenced to a special sentence of community supervision for life or parole supervision for life; or a parolee who has been convicted of aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of N.J.S.2C:13-1, endangering the welfare of a child by engaging in sexual conduct which would impair or debauch the morals of the child pursuant to subsection a. of N.J.S.2C:24-4, endangering the welfare of a child pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), or subparagraph (a) of paragraph (5) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:24-4; luring or enticing pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1993, c.291 (C.2C:13-6); kidnapping pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-1, criminal restraint pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-2, or false imprisonment pursuant to N.J.S.2C:13-3 if the victim is a minor and the offender is not the parent of the victim; knowingly promoting prostitution of a child pursuant to paragraphs (3) or (4) of subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:34-1; or an attempt to commit any of these offenses is not eligible to receive a reduction in the period of suspension, probation, or parole under the bill. With regard to a reduced term of suspension or probation under the bill, compliance is defined as the absence of a violation of a condition of suspension or probation as set forth in N.J.S.2C:45-1.  With regard to an earlier discharge from parole under the bill, compliance is defined as the absence of a violation of the conditions of parole as set forth under subsection b. of section 15 of P.L.1979, c.441 (C.30:4-123.59).  The appropriate board panel shall review a parolees compliance and eligibility to receive a reduction under this section at least once every six months.
