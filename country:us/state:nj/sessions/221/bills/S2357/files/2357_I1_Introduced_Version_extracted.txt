An Act excluding certain contributions to deferred compensation plans and providing a deduction for certain individual retirement savings under the gross income tax, amending N.J.S.54A:5-1 and P.L.1983, c.571 and supplementing chapter 3 of Title 54A of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    N.J.S.54A:5-1 is amended to read as follows: 54A:5-1.  New Jersey Gross Income Defined.  New Jersey gross income shall consist of the following categories of income: a.    Salaries, wages, tips, fees, commissions, bonuses, and other remuneration received for services rendered whether in cash or in property, and amounts paid or distributed, or deemed paid or distributed, out of a medical savings account that are not excluded from gross income pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1997, c.414 (C.54A:6-27). b.    Net profits from business.  The net income from the operation of a business, profession or other activity after provision for all costs and expenses incurred in the conduct thereof, determined either on a cash or accrual basis in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes but without deduction of the amount of: (1)  taxes based on income; (2)  a civil, civil administrative, or criminal penalty or fine, including a penalty or fine under an administrative consent order, assessed and collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, an administrative consent order, or an environmental ordinance or resolution of a local governmental entity, and any interest earned on the penalty or fine, and any economic benefits having accrued to the violator as a result of a violation, which benefits are assessed and recovered in a civil, civil administrative, or criminal action, or pursuant to an administrative consent order.  The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a penalty or fine assessed or collected for a violation of a State or federal environmental law, or local environmental ordinance or resolution, if the penalty or fine was for a violation that resulted from fire, riot, sabotage, flood, storm event, natural cause, or other act of God beyond the reasonable control of the violator, or caused by an act or omission of a person who was outside the reasonable control of the violator; and (3)  treble damages paid to the Department of Environmental Protection pursuant to subsection a. of section 7 of P.L.1976, c.141 (C.58:10-23.11f) for costs incurred by the department in removing, or arranging for the removal of, an unauthorized discharge upon the failure of the discharger to comply with a directive from the department to remove, or arrange for the removal of, a discharge. c.    Net gains or income from disposition of property.  Net gains or net income, less net losses, derived from the sale, exchange or other disposition of property, including real or personal, whether tangible or intangible as determined in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.  For the purpose of determining gain or loss, the basis of property shall be the adjusted basis used for federal income tax purposes, except as expressly provided for under this act, but without a deduction for penalties, fines, or economic benefits excepted pursuant to paragraph (2), or for treble damages excepted pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection b. of this section. A taxpayer's net gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of a share of an S corporation shall be calculated by increasing the adjusted basis of the share by an amount equal to the shareholder's net losses and deductions in respect of the share allowed and deducted from income for federal income tax purposes, not including any personal net operating loss deductions, to the extent that such net losses were not offset by the taxpayer's pro rata share of S corporation income otherwise subject to taxation pursuant to subsection p. of this section in respect of another S corporation, subject to rules of priority and assignment determined by the director.

The term "net gains or income" shall not include gains or income derived from obligations which are referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14 of this act or from securities which evidence ownership in a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1).  The term "net gains or income" shall not include gains or income derived from the sale or assignment of a tax credit transfer certificate pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-248) and section 10 of P.L.2014, c.63 (C.34:1B-251) from any sale or assignment of a tax credit issued pursuant to an award of tax credits approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority prior to July 1, 2018, regardless of when such sale or assignment occurs.  The term "net gains or net income" shall not include gains or income from transactions to the extent to which nonrecognition is allowed for federal income tax purposes.  The term "sale, exchange or other disposition" shall not include the exchange of stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization and the transfer of property to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation if immediately after the exchange such person or persons are in control of the corporation.  For purposes of this clause, stock or securities issued for services shall not be considered as issued in return for property.

For purposes of this clause, the term "control" means the ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of the corporation.

Notwithstanding any provisions hereof, upon every such exchange or conversion, the taxpayer's basis for the stock or securities received shall be the same as the taxpayer's actual or attributed basis for the stock, securities or property surrendered in exchange therefor. d.    Net gains or net income derived from or in the form of rents, royalties, patents, and copyrights. e.    Interest, except interest referred to in clause (1) or (2) of N.J.S.54A:6-14, or distributions paid by a qualified investment fund as defined in section 2 of P.L.1987, c.310 (C.54A:6-14.1), to the extent provided in that section. f.     Dividends.

STATEMENT This bill excludes from gross income taxation the elective contributions that employees of the public and non-profit sectors make toward their retirement savings, and allows a deduction for federally qualifying IRA contributions. The New Jersey gross income tax currently allows the employees of private, for profit, businesses to make tax-deferred contributions to the retirement savings plans authorized under section 401(k) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. Employees of the public and nonprofit sectors do not enjoy the same access to 401(k) plans as private sector employees. This bill expands the current provision to incorporate tax deferrals for the elective deferred compensation systems allowed to employees of governments and nonprofits.  Charitable, educational and religious organization employees and public school employees are authorized by federal law to contribute toward their retirement savings under plans established under subsection (b) of section 403 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  State and local government and authority employers are authorized by federal law to make contributions under plans established under section 457 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, and federal employees are authorized by the federal Internal Revenue Code to make contributions to the federal Thrift Savings Plan. This bill gives the employees of federally tax-exempt charitable, educational or religious organizations; the employees of public school systems; the employees of state and local government and federal employees similar tax incentives for retirement savings that are provided under the New Jersey gross income tax to private sector employees. This bill also allows a gross income tax deduction for contributions to individual retirement accounts, or premiums paid to individual retirement annuities, that qualify for federal income tax deductions. IRA's are a significant retirement savings vehicle for employees whose employers do not offer a pension plan.

STATEMENT This bill excludes from gross income taxation the elective contributions that employees of the public and non-profit sectors make toward their retirement savings, and allows a deduction for federally qualifying IRA contributions. The New Jersey gross income tax currently allows the employees of private, for profit, businesses to make tax-deferred contributions to the retirement savings plans authorized under section 401(k) of the federal Internal Revenue Code. Employees of the public and nonprofit sectors do not enjoy the same access to 401(k) plans as private sector employees. This bill expands the current provision to incorporate tax deferrals for the elective deferred compensation systems allowed to employees of governments and nonprofits.  Charitable, educational and religious organization employees and public school employees are authorized by federal law to contribute toward their retirement savings under plans established under subsection (b) of section 403 of the federal Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  State and local government and authority employers are authorized by federal law to make contributions under plans established under section 457 of the federal Internal Revenue Code, and federal employees are authorized by the federal Internal Revenue Code to make contributions to the federal Thrift Savings Plan. This bill gives the employees of federally tax-exempt charitable, educational or religious organizations; the employees of public school systems; the employees of state and local government and federal employees similar tax incentives for retirement savings that are provided under the New Jersey gross income tax to private sector employees. This bill also allows a gross income tax deduction for contributions to individual retirement accounts, or premiums paid to individual retirement annuities, that qualify for federal income tax deductions. IRA's are a significant retirement savings vehicle for employees whose employers do not offer a pension plan.
