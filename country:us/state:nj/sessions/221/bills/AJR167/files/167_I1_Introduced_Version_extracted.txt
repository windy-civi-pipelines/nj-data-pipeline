AJR167 ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION No. 167 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 2, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  ANTHONY S. VERRELLI District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Designates May 17 of each year as Necrotizing Enterocolitis Awareness Day in New Jersey. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. A Joint Resolution designating May 17 of each year as Necrotizing Enterocolitis Awareness Day in New Jersey. Whereas, Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease that can affect medically fragile infants, which causes inflammation, infection, and systemic tissue damage; and Whereas, Despite limited public understanding for the condition, NEC affects one in 1,000 premature infants and is the third most common form of death in hospitalized infants; and Whereas, NEC affects two to five percent of all premature infants but is responsible for up to 20 percent of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit costs; and Whereas, Symptoms and risk factors may be as innocuous as low birthweight, poor blood circulation, low blood oxygenation level, difficulty nursing, and the stress of the birthing process; and Whereas, The condition produces an increased risk of later functional impairment including cerebral palsy, limited gross motor skills, cardiac issues, malnutrition, and developmental delays; and Whereas, NEC limits healthy neural development, resulting in poor executive function and decreased working memory capacity over time; and Whereas, The combination of immediate healthcare costs and long term individual costs results in approximately $5.8 billion in hospital expenses each year; and Whereas, In New Jersey, approximately five in every 100,000 infants die due to NEC each year; and Whereas, Supports and interventions exist to reduce the social and financial burdens of the disease; and Whereas, Public education, regular neurodevelopmental screenings, nursing support, and use of probiotics may prevent a condition that erodes young families throughout the State, nation, and world; and Whereas, May 17 has been designated as World NEC Awareness Day by the NEC Society and other states; and Whereas, Based on the foregoing, it is in public interest to increase awareness for this condition and its social determinants in order to reduce its prevalence within New Jersey; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.  May 17 of each year is designated as Necrotizing Enterocolitis Awareness Day in New Jersey. 2.  The Governor is respectfully requested to annually issue a proclamation recognizing May 17 as Necrotizing Enterocolitis Awareness Day in New Jersey, and to call upon public officials and citizens of this State to observe the day with appropriate activities and programs. 3.  This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This resolution designates May 17 of each year as NEC Awareness Day in the State of New Jersey. Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating intestinal disease that can affect medically fragile infants. The condition causes inflammation and tissue damage which may lead to systemic infection, neurological complications, and developmental delays.  Infants afflicted with NEC often require incubation, and can pass away within hours of a turn in their condition.  Symptoms and risk factors may be as innocuous as low birthweight, poor blood circulation, blood oxygenation level, difficulty nursing, and the stress of the birthing process. Despite limited public understanding for the inflammatory disorder, NEC is the third most common cause of hospitalization and death in neonatal infants. NEC affects one in 1,000 premature infants; its mortality rate is 20-30 percent and 42 percent for the smallest premature infants. The condition affects two to five percent of all premature infants but is responsible for up to 20 percent of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit costs. Of those who survive the condition, 89 percent report long term complications including cardiac issues, motor skill loss, respiratory impairment, lost time at work, and hearing and vision challenges.  The condition produces an increased risk of later functional impairment including cerebral palsy, fine and gross motor skill loss, and behavioral issues.  Survivors experience poor executive function and worse working memory capacity over time. Several social determinants of health contribute to NEC prevalence.  Risk factors include maternal cocaine abuse, smoking, and congenital heart disease.  Mode of birth delivery and formula feeding are other precursors to the disease. NEC imposes a long-term financial burden on families and medical systems across the state and nation.  When considering lifelong medical repercussions, NEC results in approximately $5.8 billion in U.S. hospital expenses each year, or 19 percent of neonatal healthcare expenditures and $200,000 in costs for each infant receiving surgery.  NEC is the second most costly morbidity of prematurity in the U.S., impacting families not only financially but emotionally as they cope with challenging pregnancies, unmet rehabilitation needs, frequent hospital readmittance, and repeated medical procedures upon birth. With this in mind, it is in public interest for New Jersey citizens to increase their awareness of Necrotizing Enterocolitis and protective measures.  Recognizing May 17 as a commemorative day for this condition, in keeping with the designated World NEC Awareness Day and Californias recently proclaimed NEC Awareness Day, would commit public recognition to an under-acknowledged health concern.
