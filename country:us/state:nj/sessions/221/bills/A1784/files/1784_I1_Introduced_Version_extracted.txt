STATEMENT This bill enhances protections against fraudulent deed recordings by requiring the county recording officer to notify the transferor any time a deed transfer is being recorded for his or her property.  To facilitate this requirement, the bill directs the recording officer to accept and retain a submission from a property owner of his or her preferred mailing address or e-mail address, or both.  The "county recording officer" is also known as the "register of deeds and mortgages" in some counties, and the "county clerk" in the others. To further enhance protections against fraudulent deed recordings, this bill also requires the person recording the deed to submit an affidavit of title as a prerequisite to the actual deed recording. The bill allows the county recording officer to collect an additional $2 in addition to existing recording fees to offset the cost of the notification requirement.  The bill takes effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment in order to allow recording offices to adjust fees.
