If a county board of elections begins opening the inner envelopes and canvassing the mail-in ballots from the inner envelopes prior to the day of the election, the county board shall implement the measures necessary to ensure the security and secrecy of the mail-in ballots, which shall include following any guidelines established by the Secretary of State.  To the extent capable, the scanning and tabulation system shall restrict the generation of any tabulation or results report to system administrators only.  The administrator passwords shall not be shared.  No such report may be run before 8:00 p.m. on the day of the election, and, to the extent such system is capable, each county board of elections shall submit to the Division of Elections no later than 24 hours following the close of the polls on the day of the election a complete copy of the scanning and tabulation systems audit log from the time that scanning commenced until 8:00 p.m. on the date of the election.

(cf: P.L.2020, c.71, s.13) 3.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill allows county clerks to begin canvassing early votes cast during the early voting period, and county boards of elections to begin canvassing mail-in ballots, before election day under certain conditions.  However, the bill excludes provisional and emergency ballots from being counted during the early canvassing process for early votes and mail-in ballots: Under current law, early votes cast during the early voting period may not be canvassed or counted until the polls close on election day.

Under current law for mail-in ballots, any person who is authorized to receive and canvass completed mail-in-ballots who knowingly discloses to the public the contents of a mail-in ballot prior to the time designated by law for the closing of the polls for each election is guilty of a crime of the third degree. This bill extends the same penalties to the disclosure of early voting results. The bill also requires the board of elections to transmit the media for the early vote canvass to the county clerk no later than the opening of the polls on election day.  The bill further requires the county board of elections to transmit the media containing the canvass of mail-in results to the county clerk no later than one hour following the close of the polls. The bill also provides, to the extent capable, the scanning and tabulation system for mail-in ballots to restrict the generation of any tabulation or results report to system administrators only and prohibits administrator passwords from being shared. The bill further prohibits tabulation and results reports from being generated before 8:00 p.m. on the day of the election, and, to the extent such system is capable, requires each county board of elections to submit to the Division of Elections no later than 24 hours following the close of the polls on the day of the election a complete copy of the scanning and tabulation systems audit log. The bill provides that the results from the early canvassing process for mail-in ballots be reported as a separate columns alongside the columns for election day results and early voting results: The bill also requires that the county clerks rather than the board of elections certify the results of the votes cast for members of the county committees to the respective municipal clerks following the canvass of mail-in ballots.
