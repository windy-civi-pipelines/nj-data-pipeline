<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill, entitled the &quot;Innovate
New Jersey Act,&quot; creates the Innovate New Jersey Program (program) to
allow public and private colleges, universities, and community colleges in New
  Jersey to be able to apply to have vacant space or land on their campuses
designated as tax-free areas for the purpose of creating incubators for certain
new and expanding businesses.  The area designated for a business incubator may
be no more than 150,000 square feet at any one college or university and no
more than 1.5 million square feet of business incubator space authorized for
the State.  Participating colleges or universities may not utilize space that
is currently being used for academic purposes to open a business incubator. 
Business incubator programs which currently exist and meet the programs
qualifications criteria may apply for approval under the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The program transforms vacant
land and building space on the campuses of institutions of higher education
into a tax-free New Jersey area (tax-free area) for qualifying businesses. 
This creates the opportunity for businesses to engage in commerce in a zero tax
environment and allows businesses to leverage the assets of the college or university.
 Under the bill, these businesses will not be subject to State corporate or income
tax or franchise fees or any local property taxes for five years, and will not
have any sales tax liability for 10 years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Applications for acceptance
into the program are to be decided by an Innovate New Jersey Board (board) to
be established within the Economic Development Authority (EDA).  The board
consists of five members, one member each designated by the Governor, the
Senate President, the Assembly Speaker, the Senate Minority Leader, and the
Assembly Minority Leader.  The board is to decide which colleges or universities
may allocate tax-free space for a business incubator and which businesses are
eligible to locate there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A new business accepted into
the program is exempt for five years, or for the duration of the time that the
new business is participating in the program, whichever is shorter, from: 1)
the corporation business tax; 2) the gross income tax; 3) premiums taxes on
domestic and foreign insurers; and 4) local property taxes.  Further, the new
business is exempt for 10 years, or for the duration of the time that the new
business is participating in the program, whichever is shorter, from the sales
and use tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to locate in a
tax-free area: 1) A new business is to be in the formative stage of development
or engaged in the design, development, and introduction of new biotechnology,
information technology, remanufacturing, advanced materials, processing,
engineering, or electronic technology products, or innovative manufacturing
processes, and meet any other requirements for a high technology business as
the authority shall develop; 2) the missions and activities of the business are
to align with, or further the academic mission of the university or college in
the area in which the business seeks to locate; 3) a business will be required
to be a new business in the State or an expanding business that creates net new
jobs pursuant to a net-benefits test requiring that the business continue to
maintain net new jobs and employment numbers of the business and its related
companies throughout the State while in the program; and 4) the businesss
participation in the program is to have positive community and economic
effects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill establishes an
Innovate New Jersey Grant Fund (fund) to provide grants to assist selected
colleges or universities with start-up costs related to necessary capital
improvements to college or university facilities, and service improvement
including consulting and technical assistance in order to open and operate an
incubator.  Grants are to be up to $125,000 a year for the first three years
following board approval for inclusion in the program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A business that does not meet
its net new job creation performance standards is subject to a proportionate
reduction of benefits, suspension, termination, or any of the above.  In the
case of a business that acted fraudulently, the business would be immediately
terminated from the program, be subject to applicable criminal penalties
including the crime of offering a false instrument for filing in the first
degree, and be required to pay back all tax benefits that the company and its
employees have received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In administering the program,
the EDA is to create a website for the program to include, but not be limited
to: 1) a list of the resources available to potential new businesses; 2) a complete
listing of business incubator facilities located in the State; 3) a description
of the economic incentives for New Jersey-based businesses with the criteria
for each program; and 4) the contact information for the authority and the
Business Action Center. </p>
