<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    As used in this act:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Behavioral health or
behavioral health care means procedures or services rendered by a health care
or mental health care provider for the treatment of mental illness, mental
health or emotional disorders, or substance use disorders.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Care transition means the
transfer or transition of a patient from one health care or behavioral health
care provider to another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Commissioner means the
Commissioner of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Department means the
Department of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Eligible patient means a
patient with a severe behavioral health disorder who is identified pursuant to

a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) or other community
behavioral health provider that is contracted pursuant to paragraph (2) of
subsection c. of section 2 of this act to participate in the pilot program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Pilot program means the
Regional Community Behavioral Health Pilot Program established pursuant to this
act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Rapid referral means the
taking of appropriate steps by a participating provider, as soon as is
practicable and not more than 48 hours after an eligible patient undergoes a
needs assessment, as may be necessary to facilitate:  the patients referral or
transfer to, prompt access to an appointment with, and timely receipt of
services from, another appropriate health care or behavioral health care
services provider; the patients prompt and voluntary admission to an inpatient
psychiatric facility; or the patients prompt evaluation by a screening service
or mental health screener to determine whether involuntary commitment to
treatment is warranted pursuant to P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1 et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Supportive contacts means
brief communications with a patient that occur during care transitions or when
a patient misses an outpatient appointment or unexpectedly drops out of
outpatient treatment, and which show support for the patient and are designed
to promote a patients feeling of connection to treatment and willingness to
collaboratively participate in treatment.  Supportive contacts may include
the sending of postcards, letters, email messages, and text messages, the
making of phone calls, or the undertaking of home visits either by the
participating provider that is providing care to the patient or by an outside

provider has a contract or other agreement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Warm hand-off means a safe
care transition that connects a patient directly with a new health care or
mental health care provider or interim contact, such as a crisis center worker
or peer specialist, before the patients first appointment with the new
provider, or that connects a patient directly with a screening service or
mental health screener for the purposes of determining whether involuntary
commitment to treatment is warranted pursuant to P.L.1987, c.116 (C.30:4-27.1
et seq.).  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  a.  The Department of
Human Services shall establish a two-year Regional Community Behavioral Health
Pilot Program in accordance with the provisions of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Within 180 days after
the effective date of this act, the department shall issue a request for
proposals (RFP) and select one or more managed care organizations to administer
the pilot program in each of the northern, central, and southern regions of the
State.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The managed care
organization or organizations selected to administer the pilot program shall:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   access and review
Medicaid claims data, and work with primary care practitioners within the
managed care network, to identify patients in the network who have a severe
behavioral health disorder.  The patients identified pursuant to this paragraph
shall be eligible to participate in the pilot program;  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   enter into contracts
with three community behavioral health providers, one in each of the northern,
central, and southern regions of the State, and require each participating
provider to promptly perform a behavioral health needs assessment for each
eligible patient, identified under paragraph (1) of this section, who resides
in the providers region of operations.  The needs assessment shall be
performed using a standardized tool or methodology and shall be used by the
provider to identify each eligible patients behavioral health and social
service needs, including, but not limited to, the need for medication-assisted
treatment and other substance use disorder treatment, the need for mental
health treatment, including voluntary or involuntary commitment, and the need
for food, housing, financial, or other social assistance; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   work with each
participating provider, as well as with primary care providers, substance use
disorder treatment providers, and social service providers in the State, to
ensure that eligible patients in the participating providers region of operations
have access to an intensive, coordinated support system to help them navigate
the States behavioral health care service system and identify and access, in a
timely manner, necessary and appropriate behavioral health care services in the
State and region.  The coordinated support system utilized in each region shall
incorporate:  (a) the use, by participating providers, of warm hand-offs, rapid
referrals, supportive contacts, and other efficient and supportive care
transition methods; (b) the hiring, by participating providers, of service
navigation specialists and advisors to guide eligible patients through the
behavioral health care system and to direct, monitor, and keep a record of, the
services received by each eligible patient; and (c) the use, by participating
providers or the administering managed care organization or organizations, of
any other means or methods deemed appropriate or necessary to facilitate
behavioral health care coordination or care transitions for eligible patients

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   in selecting one or more
managed care organizations to administer the pilot program, give priority to
those managed care organizations that have the ability to link to, and exchange
relevant information and data through, a Statewide health information platform;
and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   following the selection
of an administering managed care organization or organizations, encourage the
administering managed care organization or organizations to engage in the
active and ongoing use of a Statewide health information platform and relevant
information contained therein, as may be necessary to efficiently and
effectively administer the pilot program.  A portion of the funds provided to
the administrating managed care organization or organizations, pursuant to
section 3 of this act, may be used thereby, as deemed appropriate, to finance
the costs associated with the use of the Statewide health information platform
pursuant to this paragraph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The pilot program
established pursuant to this act shall be funded through the Medicaid program
using a value-based payment system.  The value-based payment system shall be
modeled on, and be consistent with, the population-based payment methodology
that is described under Category 4 of the alternative payment methodologies
(APM) framework developed by the Health Care Payment Learning and Action
Network.  Specifically, the value-based payment system shall provide for a quarterly
advanced bundled payment to be provided to the administering managed care
organization or organizations for the purposes of financing the total cost of
behavioral health care that is provided, by participating providers and other
appropriate service providers, to eligible patients in the State, including,
but not limited to, the costs associated with needs assessments performed
pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection c. of section 2 of this act and the
costs associated with the provision of support and navigation services pursuant
to paragraph (3) of subsection c. of section 2 of this act.  The quarterly
bundled payment rate shall be established by the Commissioner of Human
Services, based on the commissioners evaluation of the following factors:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the number of eligible
patients, identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection c. of section 2 of
this act, who are expected to be served by the pilot program; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the average anticipated
per-patient cost of care for eligible patients; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   the anticipated costs to
participating providers of hiring and training staff to provide support and
navigation services pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection c. of section 2 of
this act; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4) the anticipated costs
associated with ensuring the linkage to, and exchange of relevant health
information through, a Statewide health information platform; and</p>

may affect the cost of care for eligible patients.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The quarterly bundled
payment provided under this section shall be limited to the bundled rate
established by the commissioner under subsection a. of this section, and shall
not be subject to increase, regardless of whether the actual costs of care
received by patients in the pilot program exceed the bundled payment rate
provided hereunder. If the administering managed care organization or
organizations, in cooperation with participating providers in each region, are
able to reduce the per-patient costs of care for patients engaged in the pilot
program through the effective use of care coordination methodologies,
including, but not limited to, the use of the service navigation and support
systems described under paragraph (3) of subsection c. of section 2 of this
act, the administering managed care organization or organizations may retain,
and shall not be required to repay, any bundled payment funds that remain
unexpended thereby.  Any such savings achieved shall be shared by the managed
care organization or organizations with the participating providers at a rate
that is proportional to the rate of per-patient cost reduction savings achieved
by each such provider.  If the actual per-patient costs of care for patients
engaged in the pilot program exceed the advanced bundled payment rate
established by the commissioner under this section, the administering managed
care organization or organizations shall ensure that all eligible patients
continue to receive appropriate services and care from participating providers
and other appropriate providers without being subject to an increase in
out-of-pocket costs.  Any financial loss suffered by the administering managed
care organization or organizations as a result of an increase in the
per-patient cost of care for patients in the pilot program shall be shared by
the managed care organization or organizations with the participating providers
at a rate that is proportional to the rate of per-patient cost increase
attributed to each provider.  </p>
