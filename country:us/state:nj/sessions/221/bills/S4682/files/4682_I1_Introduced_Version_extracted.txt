(cf: P.L.1971, c.361, s.6) 2.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill amends P.L.1971, c.361 to prohibit the condemnation, or taking of private property for a public purpose under the power of eminent domain pursuant to that law, of a property that is farmland actively supporting agricultural or horticultural production and the person or entity seeking to condemn the property intends to develop that property for a purpose other than agricultural or horticultural production. New Jersey has a stated goal of preserving 500,000 acres of farmland, which it is just over halfway to achieving. To obtain this goal the State needs to have as much active farmland as possible and should not allow it to be taken through eminent domain for non-agricultural purposes. Eminent domain is a tool to be used by the government to promote public projects, such as damns, roads, and parks, not a hammer to be used to take private property for use by other private entities to make money for themselves and the government that approves it. This bill will narrow the scope of the eminent domain law and protect farms that are needed to provide food security for citizens.
