mine safety, amending P.L.1954, c.197, and supplementing Title 27 of the
Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    (New section)  The
Legislature finds and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.    New Jerseys
transportation infrastructure is among the busiest in the nation, supporting
millions of daily commuters and facilitating regional commerce, emergency
response, and economic development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Portions of the State,
particularly in northern and central counties, are underlain by retired or
undocumented mine workings dating back as far as the 18th and 19th centuries,
which present unique and poorly mapped geological hazards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    Recent subsurface
collapses and sinkholes along Interstate Highway Route 80 have exposed the
risks of constructing and maintaining transportation infrastructure above or
near such retired mines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    These events have caused
significant disruption to public safety, commuter mobility, and infrastructure
funding in the reliability of New Jerseys highways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.    The mine safety section
within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development has the technical
expertise and statutory authority to assess, guide, and coordinate mine hazard
evaluations related to public projects, but currently lacks a clear directive
to do so in connection with transportation infrastructure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f.     It is in the public
interest to require underground structural assessments, based on scientific and
geotechnical standards, before the commencement of public highway or public
transportation projects in proximity to operating or retired mines, in order to
prevent damage, protect life and property, and support long-term infrastructure
resilience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     g.    This act seeks to
establish a modern, proactive, and collaborative framework, led by the
Department of Transportation in consultation with the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development, to ensure mine-related risks are properly evaluated and
mitigated before construction occurs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     h.    These requirements are
consistent with the States duty to promote public safety, ensure the effective
use of infrastructure investment, and safeguard taxpayer dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Section 3 of P.L.1954,
c.197 (C.34:6-98.3) is amended to read as follows:  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  There is hereby
created within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development a mine safety
section.</p>

shall be under the immediate supervision of a section chief, who shall be

style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> mine safety
inspectors, technicians<u>,</u> and other employees as may be necessary to
perform the work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.    The section chief shall
personally<u>,</u> or by assignment to employees of the section, inspect,
investigate, inquire <u>about,</u> and examine <b><span style='font-family:

to determine <u>the</u> amount and condition of air together with contaminants

"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> reports and do other related
work as required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Employees of the section
shall have the power and authority, upon exhibition of official credentials, at
all reasonable hours to enter and examine any part of a mine, mining plant, equipment<u>,</u>

necessary to facilitate such examination.</p>

and of conformity with the provisions of the Mine Safety Act; and (2) if

that the department, corporation, NJTA, SJTA, or any other State or local
government entity is in compliance with the requirements of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends current

in effect or be repealed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     It is the sponsors intent
that this bill will address the threat of ground subsidence and sinkholes
caused by historic mining activity beneath major roadways and transit corridors,
which threat presents an urgent and ongoing infrastructure and safety challenge
in New Jersey.  Recent collapses along Interstate Highway 80 have exposed the
real risks of constructing or maintaining infrastructure above unmapped or retired
mine shafts.  Such events have disrupted traffic, endangered public safety, and
diverted critical infrastructure funding toward emergency repairs.  With this
bill, the sponsor intends to take a proactive, prevention-focused approach to
infrastructure planning. </p>
