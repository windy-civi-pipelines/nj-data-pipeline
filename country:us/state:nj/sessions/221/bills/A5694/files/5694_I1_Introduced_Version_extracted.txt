A5694 ASSEMBLY, No. 5694 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE INTRODUCED MAY 15, 2025 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  CLINTON CALABRESE District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywoman Carter SYNOPSIS Requires underground structural assessment prior to commencing public highway or public transportation projects within close proximity to operating or retired mines. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As introduced. An Act concerning certain transportation projects and mine safety, amending P.L.1954, c.197, and supplementing Title 27 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    (New section)  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.    New Jerseys transportation infrastructure is among the busiest in the nation, supporting millions of daily commuters and facilitating regional commerce, emergency response, and economic development. b.    Portions of the State, particularly in northern and central counties, are underlain by retired or undocumented mine workings dating back as far as the 18th and 19th centuries, which present unique and poorly mapped geological hazards. c.    Recent subsurface collapses and sinkholes along Interstate Highway Route 80 have exposed the risks of constructing and maintaining transportation infrastructure above or near such retired mines. d.    These events have caused significant disruption to public safety, commuter mobility, and infrastructure funding in the reliability of New Jerseys highways. e.    The mine safety section within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development has the technical expertise and statutory authority to assess, guide, and coordinate mine hazard evaluations related to public projects, but currently lacks a clear directive to do so in connection with transportation infrastructure. f.     It is in the public interest to require underground structural assessments, based on scientific and geotechnical standards, before the commencement of public highway or public transportation projects in proximity to operating or retired mines, in order to prevent damage, protect life and property, and support long-term infrastructure resilience. g.    This act seeks to establish a modern, proactive, and collaborative framework, led by the Department of Transportation in consultation with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, to ensure mine-related risks are properly evaluated and mitigated before construction occurs. h.    These requirements are consistent with the States duty to promote public safety, ensure the effective use of infrastructure investment, and safeguard taxpayer dollars. 2.    Section 3 of P.L.1954, c.197 (C.34:6-98.3) is amended to read as follows: 3.    a.  There is hereby created within the Department of Labor and Workforce Development a mine safety section. b.    The mine safety section shall be under the immediate supervision of a section chief, who shall be responsible for the efficient, effective administration of the work of the section.  The section chief shall be assisted by and supervise [such other] mine safety inspectors, technicians, and other employees as may be necessary to perform the work. c.    The section chief shall personally, or by assignment to employees of the section, inspect, investigate, inquire about, and examine [into] the operation, workings, methods, safety devices and appliances, machinery, sanitation, ventilation, means of ingress and egress, means taken to protect the lives and insure the safety and health of miners, together with the causes of accidents, injuries, and fatalities and means taken to comply with the law; conduct scientific tests to determine the amount and condition of air together with contaminants therein or for any purpose that shall provide for the maintenance of safe, sanitary, and healthful conditions, furnish [such] reports and do other related work as required. d.    Employees of the section shall have the power and authority, upon exhibition of official credentials, at all reasonable hours to enter and examine any part of a mine, mining plant, equipment, or workings.  All operators and their employees shall render all assistance necessary to facilitate such examination. e.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.155). f.     (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.155). g.    (Deleted by amendment, P.L.2007, c.155). h.    No employee of the department shall make public, directly or indirectly, to any person any knowledge or information obtained by [him] the employee in the exercise of [his] the employees official duties concerning ores, ore bodies, or values of any mine or part thereof.  Any employee who shall violate any of the provisions of this subsection shall be guilty of a crime of the fourth degree and, on conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than [$500.00] $500 nor more than [$1,000.00] $1,000 or imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed [1] one year, or both, and shall be dismissed from [his] the employees position. i.     It shall be the duty of the section to cause to have inspected at least once in every [3] three months, every underground mine in this State, and every other working mine at least twice each year, and more often, if it is deemed necessary for the safety of the persons involved with the mine. j.     After every inspection, the mine safety inspector shall enter forthwith in a book to be kept at the mine and designated as the "record of mine safety inspection," the portion of the mine inspected, the nature of the inspection, and the dangers and defects observed.  This record shall be open at all reasonable hours to the examination of the operator, any employee, or the designated representative of the employees of the mine inspected.  Nothing contained in or omitted from any entry in [such] the record shall limit or affect the duty and obligations of the operator, superintendent, or employee. k.    The section shall develop and publish risk-based guidance for evaluating the proximity of a proposed public highway project or public transportation project to an operating or retired mine and the potential for mine subsidence, taking into account mine depth, age, construction type, and historical collapse incidents and shall issue guidance to assist the Department of Transportation, the New Jersey Transit Corporation, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the South Jersey Transportation Authority, and any other State or local government entity in determining: (1) whether the proposed public highway project or public transportation project is located within close proximity, as determined by the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, to an operating or retired mine;

It is the sponsors intent that this bill will address the threat of ground subsidence and sinkholes caused by historic mining activity beneath major roadways and transit corridors, which threat presents an urgent and ongoing infrastructure and safety challenge in New Jersey.  Recent collapses along Interstate Highway 80 have exposed the real risks of constructing or maintaining infrastructure above unmapped or retired mine shafts.  Such events have disrupted traffic, endangered public safety, and diverted critical infrastructure funding toward emergency repairs.  With this bill, the sponsor intends to take a proactive, prevention-focused approach to infrastructure planning.
