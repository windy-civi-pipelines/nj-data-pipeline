STATEMENT This bill prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm, practice, affordance, or feature that the platform knows, or which by the exercise of reasonable care should have known, could cause child users to develop an eating disorder, including, but not limited to, promoting diet products. A social media platform would not be found to violate the provisions of this bill if the social media platform: (1) demonstrates that the platform instituted and maintained an internal quarterly audit program in which the platform audits its practices, algorithms, designs, features, and affordances to determine whether these practices, algorithms, designs, features, or affordances cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to the development of eating disorders in child users on the platform; (2) hires an independent third party to conduct an annual audit of its practices, algorithms, designs, features, or affordances to determine whether these practices, algorithms, designs, features, or affordances cause, have the potential to cause, or contribute to the development of eating disorders in child users on the platform; and within 30 calendar days of the completion of the audit and upon the social media platforms receipt of notification of the issue, the social media platform takes action to correct any practice, algorithm, design, feature, or affordance if an audit determines that the practice, algorithm, design, feature, or affordance used by the platform causes, has the potential to cause, or contributes to the development of eating disorders in child users; or (3) is controlled by a business entity that generated less than $100 million in gross revenue during the preceding calendar year.
