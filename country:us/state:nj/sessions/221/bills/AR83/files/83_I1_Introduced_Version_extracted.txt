SCHAER District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblyman  CLINTON CALABRESE District 36 (Bergen and Passaic) Assemblywoman  VERLINA REYNOLDS-JACKSON District 15 (Hunterdon and Mercer) SYNOPSIS Urges Congress to require VA hospitals to provide all routine screenings for women veterans on-site at each hospital. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Assembly Resolution urging Congress to require United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to provide all routine medical screenings for women veterans on-site at each hospital. Whereas, Women have played a vital role in the nations military and make up approximately 10 percent of the armed forces; and Whereas, Women have medical needs that are different than those of men, and the brave women who proudly served the nation and risked their lives to protect our freedom deserve the investment of every possible resource to ensure their well-being and good health; and Whereas, All eligible women veterans have access to certain screenings at United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals, either on-site or at facilities in the community; and Whereas, When screenings are not available on-site, women veterans are forced to travel to other doctors and facilities for routine medical screenings; and Whereas, Traveling to different doctors and facilities for routine medical screenings requires additional time and resources, thus burdening women veterans; and Whereas, Increased funding to VA hospitals would improve the type and quality of services available at VA hospitals; and Whereas, Increased funding would permit VA hospitals to be able to provide all routine medical care screenings for women veterans on-site, removing the burden on women veterans to travel to other locations for routine screenings; and Whereas, It is important for our women veterans to know that the care they receive from the VA is consistent with or exceeds the care found in the private sector; and Whereas, Investing in the well-being of women veterans not only benefits those veterans, it benefits every citizen of the United States, as such an investment ensures that these individuals will thrive in their civilian lives; and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper for this House to urge Congress to require VA hospitals to provide all routine medical screenings for women veterans on-site at each hospital; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This House urges Congress to require United States Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals to provide all routine medical screenings for women veterans on-site at each hospital. 2.    Copies of this resolution, as filed with the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to each member of Congress elected from this State, and to the Secretary of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. STATEMENT Women have played a vital role as members of the military of our nation.  Therefore, women veterans deserve the investment of every possible resource to ensure their well-being. All eligible women veterans have access to certain medical screenings either on-site at United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals or at facilities in the community.  However, increased funding would permit VA hospitals to be able to provide all routine care screenings for women veterans on-site, removing the need for women veterans to travel to various locations for their routine screenings. Investing in the well-being of women veterans not only benefits those veterans, it benefits every citizen of the United States, as such an investment ensures that these individuals will thrive in their civilian lives.
