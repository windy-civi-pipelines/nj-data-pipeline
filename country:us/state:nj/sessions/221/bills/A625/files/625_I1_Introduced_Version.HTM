<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    (New section)    a.   The
Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board shall study the effects of
vaccination on infant mortality and near mortality.  The purpose of the study
shall be to identify: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   instances in which the
death of an infant is determined to have resulted, in whole or in part, from
vaccination of the infant; </p>

near fatal event involving an infant is determined to have resulted, in whole
or in part, from vaccination of the infant; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   instances in which the
definitive cause of an infant fatality or near fatality is not clear after
investigation, but in which there is reason to believe that vaccination may
have been a contributing or primary factor leading to the fatality or near
fatality; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   the percentage of total
infant fatalities and near fatalities occurring in the State that definitively
resulted, in whole or in part, from vaccination, and the percentage of total
infant fatalities and near fatalities occurring in the State wherein
vaccination is a suspected, but not proven, factor that may have contributed to
the death or near fatal event; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In conducting the study
pursuant to this section, the board may seek the advice of persons specializing
in the fields of neonatal, post neonatal, or pediatric pathology, infant
health, immunology, and epidemiology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Within one year after
the date of enactment of this act, the board shall prepare and submit a report
to the Governor, and, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1),
to the Legislature.  The report shall identify the boards findings from the
study, including, but not limited to, findings on the rate of infant fatalities
and near fatalities resulting from vaccination, and findings on the patterns
and trends that are evident from the data; and shall provide recommendations
for legislative or other actions that can be undertaken to reduce or eliminate
infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting from vaccination, while
continuing to ensure the protection of the public against communicable disease.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    The board shall
additionally prepare and submit supplemental reports to the Governor, and,
pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), to the Legislature, at
the intervals deemed by the board to be appropriate, but not less often than
every five years after the first report is submitted pursuant to subsection d.
of this section.  Any supplemental report submitted under this subsection shall
include the information required by subsection d. of this section, and shall
additionally identify: (1) the extent to which any prior recommendations of the
board, made pursuant to this section, have been successfully implemented in
practice; and (2) the apparent impact that those changes have had on
vaccination-related infant fatalities and near fatalities during the reporting
period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would provide for
the identification and study of infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting
from vaccination, and would require the inclusion of vaccination information in
reports of sudden or unexpected infant death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
States Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board, in particular, to identify
fatalities and near fatalities occurring among infant children, which may have
resulted, in whole or in part, from the prior vaccination of the infant.  The
bill would require the board to ensure that at least one of the local or
regional community-based review teams operating under its authority is
designated to review the cases of infant fatality and near fatality that are
identified by the board pursuant to the bills provisions.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board would also be
required to engage in an ongoing study of the effects of vaccination on infant
mortality and near mortality.  The purpose of the study would be to identify: 
instances in which an infant death is determined to have resulted, in whole or
in part, from vaccination of the infant; instances in which a near fatal event
involving an infant is determined to have resulted, in whole or in part, from
vaccination of the infant; instances in which the definitive cause of a death
or near fatal event is unclear after investigation, but in which there is
reason to believe that vaccination was a contributing factor in the death or
near fatal event; the percentage of total infant fatalities and near fatalities
occurring in the State that have definitively resulted, in whole or in part,
from vaccination, and the percentage of total infant fatalities and near
fatalities occurring in the State wherein vaccination is a suspected, but not a
proven, factor contributing to the death or near fatal event; patterns and
trends in infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting from vaccination; and
ways to reduce or eliminate infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting
from vaccination.  In conducting the study, the board would be authorized to
seek the advice of persons specializing in the fields of neonatal, post
neonatal, or pediatric pathology, infant health, immunology, and epidemiology.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Within one year after the
bills enactment, the board would be required to submit a report to the
Governor and Legislature.  The report would include the boards findings on the
rate of infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting from vaccination; a
description of patterns and trends that are evident from the collected data;
and recommendations for legislative or other actions that can be undertaken to
reduce or eliminate infant fatalities and near fatalities resulting from
vaccination, while continuing to ensure the protection of the public against
communicable disease.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The board would additionally
be required to provide supplemental reports to the Governor and Legislature, at
intervals deemed by the board to be appropriate, but not less often than every
five years after the first report is submitted.  Any supplemental report would
include the same information that is to be included in the first report, and
would additionally identify:  the extent to which any prior recommendations of
the board have been successfully implemented in practice; and the apparent
impact that those changes have had on vaccination-related infant mortality and
near mortality during the reporting period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In order to facilitate the
boards work, the bill would provide that, in any case of sudden or unexpected
infant death (i.e., in any case where the cause of death of a child under three
years of age is not obvious before investigation), the infants physician of
record, in cooperation with the emergency medical responders who responded to
the scene of death, the medical examiner who is tasked with performing the
autopsy, the medicolegal death investigator who is tasked with investigating
the scene of death, and any other appropriate parties, will be required to
complete a Sudden Unexplained Infant Death Investigation Reporting Form (SUIDI
form), which is made available by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Preventions Division of Reproductive Health.  In completing the form, the
infants physician of record would be required to attach, as an addendum to the
forms Infant Medical History section, a record of all vaccines that have been
administered to the infant in the six-month period preceding the infants
death.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>            A completed SUIDI form
would need to be submitted, within 10 days after completion, to the Child
Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board, which would then use the forms to
facilitate its identification and study of vaccination-related infant
fatalities and near fatalities, as provided by the bill.  The board would also
be authorized to use these SUIDI forms for any other purpose that is related to
its duties, as deemed by the board to be appropriate.</p>
