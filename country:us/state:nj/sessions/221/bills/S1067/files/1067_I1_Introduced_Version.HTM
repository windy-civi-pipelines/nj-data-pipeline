TERESA RUIZ District 29 (Essex and Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senators Burgess, Diegnan, Singer and McKnight SYNOPSIS Right to Mental Health for Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Act; establishes certain requirements concerning provision of mental health services to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning access to mental health services for people who are deaf and hard of hearing and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    This act shall be known and may be cited as the Right to Mental Health for Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Act. 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as a group, represent an underserved population in many respects, particularly with regard to access to mental health services. b.    Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing often require highly specialized mental health services because of communication barriers and other complex needs. c.     Research shows that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing are subject to significantly more risks to their mental health than are individuals who are able to hear, for reasons that include, but are not limited to, issues involving communication access in general, deficient communication with family members, educators, and treating healthcare professionals, and access to appropriate educational services and culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate physical and mental health services. d.    Some individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may have secondary disabilities that affect the type and manner of the mental health services the individual needs.  For example, individuals who are deaf and blind often have diverse ways of communicating, such as through the use of tactile sign language. e.     Being deaf or hard of hearing affects the most basic human needs, including the ability to communicate with other human beings.  Many individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing use sign language, which may be their primary method of communication, while other individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing receive language orally and aurally, with or without visual signs or cues.  However, some individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing lack any significant language skills, may experience language deprivation, or both. f.     Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing frequently possess highly diverse communication skills and experience highly diverse communication challenges.  The nature and timing of a hearing loss, the success of medical or therapeutic remediation efforts, and the accessibility of sign language or spoken language at home, school, and in other settings, each shape the way that hearing loss affects an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing. g.    The communication ability of an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing can vary widely, and can be affected by factors such as the individuals innate abilities and the degree to which the individual has been supported in language acquisition. Some individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing are multilingual, with fluency in more than one communication method, while others are alingual, with fluency in no communication methods.  However, it is not uncommon for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to have poorly developed language skills in both sign language and spoken language. h.    It is essential that individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing: (1)   have access to appropriate mental health services that are provided in the primary communication method used by the individual, as determined by the individuals preference, by the results of an appropriate communication assessment, or both; (2)   have access to services provided by mental health professionals who are fluent in the individuals primary method of communication, understand the unique nature of being deaf or hard of hearing, possess the knowledge and training to work effectively with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to provide culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate mental health services, and who can collaborate skillfully with interpreters; (3)   have access to mental health professionals who are familiar with the unique culture and needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, as a lack of awareness of the special needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing or a lack training in working with individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing can result in misdiagnosis of a mental health issue; (4)   are involved in determining the scope, content, and purpose of the mental health services they are provided, which services should be tailored for delivery to the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing; and (5)   have access to mental health services that provide appropriate one-on-one access to a full continuum of mental health services, including all modes of therapy and evaluation, as well as access to specialized mental health services that are consistent with best practices and use appropriate curricula, staff, and outreach to support the unique mental health needs of individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. i.     Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing should have access to a resource guide listing the mental health services in this State that offer the best access and provide the most specialized mental health services for clients. j.     Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing will benefit from the development and implementation of State and regional services designed to address their unique and specialized mental health needs. 3.    As used in this act: Certified mental health professional means a psychiatrist, psychologist, advanced practice nurse, therapist, counselor, or social worker licensed or certified to practice under Title 45 of the Revised Statutes who is certified by the Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in the Department of Human Services as:  fluent in one or more primary communication methods; a specialist who is trained and experienced in working skillfully with interpreters; and knowledgeable of the cultural needs of clients. Client means an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing and who is in need of mental health services. Communication skills assessment means the Sign Language Proficiency Interview assessment and any other communication skills assessment approved by the Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing in the Department of Human Services. Culturally affirmative mental health services means mental health services provided by certified mental health professionals and support staff, which services are sensitive to, and in support of, the diverse cultural affiliations and needs of clients, including affiliation with the deaf community and culture. Deaf means the condition of having sustained a hearing loss that is so severe that the individual has difficulty in processing linguistic information through hearing, regardless of amplification or other assistive technology, as well as the unique culture, community, and identity of an individual who is deaf. English-based manual or sign system means a sign system that uses manual signs in English word order, which may include the use of added affixes that are not present in American Sign Language. Fluent means a sign language communication skills assessment score of Advanced, in the case of a certified mental health professional, and a sign language communication skills assessment score of Intermediate Plus, in the case of other licensed and nonlicensed support staff working in a mental health setting. Hard of hearing means the condition of having sustained a hearing loss, whether permanent or fluctuating, which hearing loss may be corrected by amplification or other hearing assistive technology, but which, regardless of correction, presents challenges in processing linguistic information through hearing. Interpreter means an interpreter certified by the New Jersey Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf. Linguistically appropriate mental health services means the full continuum of mental health services that are made available in the method of communication preferred by the client or in the method of communication that is determined to be most effective for the individual, based on the results of a communication assessment. Method of communication means any of the following systems of communication used by clients:  American Sign Language; an English-based manual or sign system; a highly visually oriented and minimal sign language system to communicate, including, but not limited to, a home-sign-based system, idiosyncratic signs, a sign system or language of another country, or non-linguistic or semi-linguistic communication systems designed to meet the needs of language-deprived or dysfluent individuals; or an oral, aural, or speech-based sign system. Oral, aural, or speech-based system means a communication system that uses the speech or residual hearing, or both, of an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, regardless of technology or cued assistance. Primary method of communication means the method of communication preferred by an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing that will be most effective, as determined by the preference of the individual who is deaf or hard of hearing, by the results of an appropriate communication assessment, or both.

and (2)   not deny a client access to culturally affirmative mental health services or linguistically appropriate mental health services using the clients primary method of communication due to the clients having: (a)   residual hearing ability, whether or not supported by amplification or other hearing assistive technology; or (b)   previous experience with another method of communication. b.    Nothing in this section shall be construed to: (1)   prevent a client from receiving mental health services in more than one method of communication;

STATEMENT This bill, which is designated as the Right to Mental Health Care for Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Act, establishes certain requirements concerning the provision of mental health services to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, who are referred to in the bill as clients. Specifically, the bill requires that mental health services be provided in a manner that is culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate, using the clients primary method of communication.  Clients may receive services using more than one method of communication, and will retain the right to refuse services. The Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) in the Department of Human Services (DHS), in consultation with the Division of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DDHH) in the DHS, will be required to:  implement and maintain culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate mental health services; recruit, develop, and maintain an adequate number of certified mental health professionals and support staff to meet the demand for culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate mental health services; monitor the services provided to ensure that clients are adequately served; provide adequate funding for services; develop certification criteria for mental health professionals to provide services to clients, as well as incentives to promote professional recruitment and retention; and develop and implement strategies to ensure access to mental health services regardless of geography, which may include the use of telemedicine and other approved remote technologies. The DMHAS, in consultation with the DDHH, will be required to employ a deaf services coordinator, who will be responsible for coordinating and overseeing the implementation of culturally affirmative and linguistically appropriate mental health services Statewide. Among other things, the coordinator will be required to ensure appropriate mental health services for clients are accessible Statewide in all treatment settings; serve as a liaison throughout State government to maximize the use of State resources and engage in joint planning; develop a model for a Statewide system of care; collaborate with mental health professionals throughout the State to assist and ensure compliance with State and federal laws relating to mental health services for clients; collect and evaluate clinical and programmatic outcome data; distribute funds or grants to achieve optimum service delivery; prepare and submit reports as required by the DMHAS and DDHH; and provide clinical and administrative case consultations support the provision of mental health services to clients. The deaf services coordinator will be required to establish an advisory committee to make recommendations and provide advice and assistance concerning the implementation of the bill.
