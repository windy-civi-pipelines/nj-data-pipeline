A3540 3R ACS [Third Reprint] ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE SUBSTITUTE FOR ASSEMBLY, No. 3540 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE ADOPTED MAY 20, 2024 Sponsored by: Assemblyman  HERB CONAWAY, JR. District 7 (Burlington) Assemblyman  LOUIS D. GREENWALD District 6 (Burlington and Camden) Assemblywoman  ELLEN J. PARK District 37 (Bergen) Senator  PAUL D. MORIARTY District 4 (Atlantic, Camden and Gloucester) Senator  KRISTIN M. CORRADO District 40 (Bergen, Essex and Passaic) Co-Sponsored by: Assemblywomen Quijano, Haider, Assemblymen Karabinchak, Wimberly, Stanley, Sampson, Miller, Assemblywomen Bagolie, Lampitt, Speight, Ramirez, Swain, Assemblymen Hutchison, Tully, Senators Bramnick, Turner, Scutari, Amato and Assemblywoman Hall SYNOPSIS Establishes criminal penalties for production or dissemination of deceptive audio or visual media, commonly known as deepfakes. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT As amended on March 17, 2025 by the General Assembly pursuant to the Governor's recommendations. An Act establishing 3civil and3 criminal penalties for the production and dissemination of deceptive audio or visual media and supplementing Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 31. The Legislature finds and declares that: a. Technological advances in artificial intelligence have resulted in widespread accessibility to sophisticated deepfake technology, which can be used to manipulate audio and visual content to create deceptive audio and visual media depictions that often cannot be distinguished from reality. b. Digitally altered media generated with this technology can produce false and deceptive, but completely realistic and convincing, media depicting events that never happened, interactions that never took place, conduct that never occurred, and statements that were never made. c. While there are numerous valid and appropriate uses for this sophisticated technology, such as criticism, comment, satire, parody, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, it may also be used inappropriately, to deceive, humiliate, or violate the privacy of individuals who are portrayed in deceptive audio and visual media without their consent. d. It is manifest that lawbreakers will use all available tools to subvert the law, and deepfake technology, which may be readily accessed through the Internet or computer software programs, can be a powerful tool to accomplish illicit ends.  Utilizing deepfake technology, bad actors may engage in a broad range of criminal or unlawful conduct such as creating audio and visual media depictions of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation involving children or non-consenting adults, creating false, misleading, and misattributed political advertising and campaign materials, and targeting individuals and corporate entities for harassment, damaging reputations and ruining lives.  Punishment for committing a crime using deepfake technology should be cumulative, as the impact of the underlying criminal conduct is amplified through the insidious use of deepfake technology as the means to break the law. e. With the readily available amplifiers of the Internet and social media, digital media can be both ubiquitous and enduring, and the harm to a person falsely depicted in a deepfake image or visual or audio recording can result in widespread and pervasive emotional distress, reputational damage, and indelible harm to that persons personal and professional relationships. f. There is a compelling State interest in fostering the appropriate use of deepfake technology and deterring the inappropriate application of this technology to commit illicit conduct, in a way that safeguards the health, safety, and welfare of the public without unduly infringing on the First Amendment rights of content creators.  Similarly, the State has a compelling interest in protecting the privacy and reputational interests of residents who might otherwise be falsely depicted through deepfake technology, and in providing them a meaningful mechanism through which to obtain appropriate redress. g. While civil liability and enforcement may to some extent prevent the misuse of this technology in furtherance of criminal activity, the relative ease with which this technology may be accessed and deployed, measured against the magnitude of the indelible and long-lasting harms its use can inflict upon victims and their families, warrants more severe consequences to more effectively punish and deter the inappropriate use of deepfake technology. h. Accordingly, the Legislature finds that it is necessary and proper to establish robust specific criminal penalties to punish and deter the use of deepfake technology to generate or create works of deceptive audio or visual media for the purpose of attempting or furthering the commission of a crime or offense, or to solicit, disclose, or use a work of deceptive audio or visual media for that purpose, and by providing the aggrieved victims of such conduct a civil recourse by which they may seek appropriate recompense.3 3[1.] 2.3  a.  As used in P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill): Deceptive audio or visual media means any video recording, motion picture film, sound recording, electronic image, photograph, any technological representation of speech or conduct substantially derivative thereof, or any forgery or facsimile of a document or writing, that appears to a reasonable person to realistically depict any speech, conduct, or writing of a person who did not in fact engage in the speech, conduct, or writing, and the production of which was substantially dependent upon technical means, rather than the ability of another person to physically or verbally impersonate the person. Disclose means to sell, give, provide, lend, trade, mail, deliver, transfer, publish, distribute, circulate, disseminate, present, exhibit, advertise, offer, share, or make 3externally3 available via the Internet or by any other means, whether or not for pecuniary gain. Interactive computer service provider shall have the same meaning as set forth in 47 U.S.C. s.230. Solicit means to offer to create or generate, or to advertise the ability to create or generate, a work of deceptive audio or visual media, whether or not for hire, commission, monetary remuneration, or pecuniary gain.  Solicit shall also mean to request the creation or generation of a work of deceptive audio or visual media, whether or not for monetary remuneration or compensation. Victim means a person who suffers personal, physical, or psychological injury or death or incurs loss of or injury to personal or real property as a result of the conduct of another that would constitute a violation of subsections b. or c. of this section.  Victim also includes the spouse, parent, legal guardian, grandparent, child, sibling, domestic partner, or civil union partner of the decedent in the case of a persons death. Video streaming service means a service that transmits video content over the Internet that is played continuously without download. b.   A natural person commits a crime of the third degree if, without license or privilege to do so, the person generates or creates, or causes to be generated or created, a work of deceptive audio or visual media 3[with the intent that it be used as part of a plan or course of conduct to commit] for the purpose of attempting or furthering the commission of3 any crime or offense, 3or with the knowledge that the work is to be used by another for such purpose,3 including but not limited to: (1) a crime or offense under chapters 14, 16, 20, 21, 28, or 29 of Title 2C of the New Jersey Statutes; (2) advertising commercial sex abuse of a minor, pursuant to subsection b. of section 12 of P.L.2013, c.51 (C.2C:13-10); (3) endangering the welfare of children, pursuant to N.J.S.2C:24-4; (4) threats or improper influence in official and political matters, pursuant to N.J.S.2C:27-3; (5) false public alarms, pursuant to N.J.S.2C:33-3; (6) harassment, pursuant to N.J.S.2C:33-4; (7) cyber-harassment, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.2013, c.272 (C.2C:33-4.1); or (8) hazing, pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1980, c.169 (C.2C:40-3). 3[The trier of fact may infer that a work of deceptive audio or visual media was generated or created without license or privilege to do so if the work was generated or created using a commercially or publicly available generative artificial intelligence system in violation of the terms of service, terms of use, or end user license agreement of the system.]3 c. (1)  A natural person commits a crime of the third degree if, without license or privilege to do so, the person solicits, discloses, or uses a work of deceptive audio or visual media 3[as part of a plan or course of conduct to commit] for the purpose of attempting or furthering the commission of3 any crime or offense,3or with the knowledge that the work is to be used by another for such purpose,3 including but not limited to any crime or offense listed in subsection b. of this section.
