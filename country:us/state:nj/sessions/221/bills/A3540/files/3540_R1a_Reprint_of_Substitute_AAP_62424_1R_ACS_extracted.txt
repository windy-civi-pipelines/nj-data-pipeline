A conviction for a violation of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall not be a prerequisite for a civil action brought pursuant to this subsection.  The civil action authorized by this subsection shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other civil action, injunctive relief, or other remedy available at law, including, but not limited to, a civil action for common law defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, false light, misappropriation of identity, intrusion of privacy, or public disclosure of private facts. g.   (1) It shall be deemed a fair use and shall not be a violation of P.L.    , c.     (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) if a work of deceptive audio or visual media1[,] is1 clearly identified as a work of deceptive audio or visual media 1or, if the deceptive nature of the work is unknown or unverified, but is clearly identified as a possible work of deceptive audio or visual media1, is disclosed in connection with criticism, comment, satire, parody, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. s.107.
