(2)   Upon reasonable notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, a tenant shall grant an owner access to the affected unit for purposes of inspection or eradication.  If the tenant, after receiving reasonable notice of an inspection or eradication pursuant to this subsection, interferes with, obstructs, or actively inhibits access to the unit for purposes of a visual inspection for, or eradication of, the presence of bedbugs, the owner shall not be liable to the tenant of the unit for any damages relating to and arising from the presence of bedbugs. 5.    (New section)  a.  If the owner does not act, within 10 days, pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.

(C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $300 for each affected dwelling unit and not more than $1000 for each affected common area in the multiple dwelling. Such penalty shall be recovered by and in the name of the local board of health, if one exists.  If no local board exists, the penalty shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality. b.    The local board or local health officer may bring an action in a summary manner pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), and the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey governing actions for the collection of civil penalties, in the municipal court or the Superior Court to recover a penalty imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The court is empowered to issue any appropriate injunctive orders, and to authorize immediate collection of reimbursable costs due the local board. 9.    (New section)  The commissioner, in consultation with the Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 10.  R.S.26:3-46 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-46.      The local board, within its jurisdiction, shall examine into and prohibit any nuisance, offensive matter, foul or noxious odors, gases or vapors, water in which mosquito larvae breed, and all causes of ill health or disease, including bedbugs, which may be known to  the board or brought to its attention, which, in its opinion, are injurious to  the health of the inhabitants therein, and shall cause the same to be removed and abated at the expense of the owner. (cf: R.S.26:3-46) 11.  R.S.26:3-49 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-49.      Whenever any nuisance, noxious gases or vapors, water in which mosquito larvae breed, or cause of ill health or disease is found on private property, the local board shall notify the owner to remove and abate the same, at his own  expense, within such time as the board may specify.  A duplicate of the notice  shall be left with one or more of the tenants or occupants.  Whenever any infestation of bedbugs is found in a multiple dwelling, the local board shall notify the owner to eradicate the infestation, at his own expense, immediately. If the owner resides out of the state or cannot be so notified speedily, a notice left at the house or premises with the tenant or occupant, or posted on the premises, shall suffice. In the event that an owner does not eradicate an infestation of bedbugs immediately following notice pursuant to this section, the local board of health is authorized to act as an a agent for the landlord, pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ), for purposes of eradicating the infestation. (cf: R.S.26:3-49) 12.  R.S.26:3-54 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-54.      The local board may recover, by a civil action, the expenses incurred in such removal and abatement from any person who shall have caused or allowed such nuisance, source of foulness, water in which mosquito larvae breed, or cause of sickness, hazardous to the public health to exist, or from any owner, tenant, or occupant of premises who, after notice as herein provided, shall fail to remove and abate the same within the time specified in the notice.  The  local board may recover, by a civil action, the expenses incurred in eradication of an infestation of bedbugs, pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ), from the owner of  a multiple dwelling who, after notice, failed to eradicate the infestation of bedbugs. (cf: P.L.1953, c.26, s.14) 13.  Section 7 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7.    The commissioner shall issue and promulgate, in the manner specified in section 8 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-8), such regulations as the commissioner may deem necessary to assure that any hotel or multiple dwelling will be maintained in such manner as is consistent with, and will protect, the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or intended occupants thereof, or of the public generally. Any such regulations issued and promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall provide standards and specifications for such maintenance materials, methods and techniques, fire warning and extinguisher systems, elevator systems, emergency egresses, and such other protective equipment as the commissioner shall deem reasonably necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or intended occupants of any units of dwelling space in any hotel or multiple dwelling, including but not limited to: (a)   Structural adequacy ratings; (b)   Methods of egress, including fire escapes, outside fireproof stairways, independent stairways, and handrails, railings, brackets, braces and landing platforms thereon, additional stairways, and treads, winders, and risers thereof, entrances and ramps; (c)   Bulkheads and scuttles, partitions, walls, ceilings and floors; (d)   Garbage and refuse collection and disposal, cleaning and janitorial services, repairs, and extermination services; (e)   Electrical wiring and outlets, and paints and the composition thereof; (f)   Doors, and the manner of opening thereof; (g)   Transoms, windows, shafts and beams; (h)   Chimneys, flues and central heating units; (i)    Roofing and siding materials; (j)    Lots, yards, courts and garages, including the size and location thereof; (k)   Intakes, open ducts, offsets and recesses; (l)    Windows, including the size and height thereof; (m) Rooms, including the area and height thereof, and the permissible number of occupants thereof; (n)   Stairwells, skylights and alcoves; (o)   Public halls, including the lighting and ventilation thereof; (p)   Accessory passages to rooms; (q)   Cellars, drainage and air space; (r)    Water-closets, bathrooms and sinks; (s)   Water connections, including the provision of drinking and hot and cold running water; (t)    Sewer connections, privies, cesspools, and private sewers; (u)   Rain water and drainage conductors; (v)   Entrances and ramps; [and] (w)  Presence of lead-based paint hazards in multiple dwellings and in single-family and two-family dwellings, exclusive of owner-occupied dwelling units, subject to P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.1 et al.).  In a common interest community, any inspection fee for and violation found within a unit which is solely related to this subsection shall be the responsibility of the unit owner and not the homeowners' association, unless the association is the owner of the unit; and (x)   Presence of bedbugs, as defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or the presence of other vermin and pests in multiple dwellings. (cf: P.L.2007, c.251, s.5) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require owners of multiple dwellings to maintain a safe and clean living environment free of the presence of bedbugs.  This legislation provides that property owners are responsible for maintaining multiple dwellings free of bedbug infestations, and must remove bedbugs at their own expense when they become aware of an infestation in a multiple dwelling. This bill provides that a landlord who does not take prompt action upon written notice that bedbugs have infested a property is financially liable for the consequences. The Department of Health is charged with preparing and publishing a bedbug education document in pamphlet form.  The legislation would require multiple dwelling owners to provide tenants with this pamphlet within 90 days after the department makes it available to the public.  Owners of multiple dwellings would be required to deliver this pamphlet to tenants, who would be required to sign an acknowledgment that they received this document.  If an owner is unable to obtain a signature, the owner shall be deemed in compliance with the delivery requirement if two attempts are made to deliver the pamphlet, one of which shall be by certified or registered mail. This publication would set forth the legal rights and responsibilities of both owners and tenants imposed by this legislation. The pamphlet would advise tenants that their units may be subject to inspection for bedbugs and that the tenants may be responsible for certain costs related to bedbug eradication. If enacted, this legislation would require the owner to deliver the pamphlet before charging certain expenses to tenants or deducting certain expenses from tenants' security deposits. This bill requires owners to act to eradicate bedbugs within 10 days of receiving written notice of the presence of bedbugs in a unit.  When a unit is rented for seasonal use, the owner would have only seven days to act.  This bill also requires the owner of a multiple dwelling to provide the tenant with 48 hours' notice that access is required to a unit for purposes of eradicating the presence of bedbugs prior to entering the unit for purposes of inspecting for or eradicating bedbugs. This legislation imposes a duty on tenants to notify the owner of the presence of bedbugs in the unit. This legislation also would require a local board of health to act on the owner's behalf to eradicate the presence bedbugs when an owner does not do so.  This bill has no financial impact on taxpayers because the property owner is required to reimburse the board when it acts on the owner's behalf.

(C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the tenant may notify, in writing, the local board or local health officer of any failure of the multiple dwelling to be kept in a condition free of  bedbugs. b.    If, following written notice from a tenant, or from the local board pursuant to R.S.26:3-49, or from the Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to an inspection conducted pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-7) the owner of a multiple dwelling does not eradicate the bedbugs pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the local health officer shall act as an agent for the owner of a multiple dwelling to inspect for the presence of bedbugs and, if required, to engage a commercial pesticide applicator at a usual and customary price in the area to eradicate the bedbugs, within 10 days following written notice  to all affected tenants, as described in subsection c. of section 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). c.     Any commercial pesticide applicator who provides services to eradicate the presence of bedbugs in accordance with subsection a. of this section may bill the owner of a multiple dwelling directly. The municipality or a local board may adopt an ordinance, similar to an ordinance adopted pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1962, c.66 (C.40:48-2.12f), providing that the municipality shall pay the costs of eradication of the presence of bedbugs, and that the costs shall be charged against the multiple dwelling premises, and  may be a lien against the premises.  In the event that a landlord fails to pay the costs pursuant to this section, the municipality or local board may serve written notice of the failure to pay, and shall demand that the deficiency be cured within 10 days. Judicial notice or hearing shall be required to enforce the lien.  The owner of the multiple dwelling shall reimburse the local health officer or local board for the actual costs incurred for any eradication of the presence of bedbugs. 6.    (New section)  a.  An owner shall visually inspect the unit no more than 30 days prior to the date a new lease term commences or a new tenant commences occupancy of a dwelling unit, except for a dwelling unit rented, occupied, or leased for seasonal use. The owner shall visually inspect any dwelling unit rented, occupied, or leased for seasonal use that has been unoccupied for 30 days or more prior to the date a new lease term commences or a new tenant commences occupancy of a dwelling unit.  The owner shall include a provision in the lease certifying that the owner has visually inspected the dwelling unit for the presence of bedbugs. b.    An owner may visually inspect a dwelling unit for evidence of the presence of bedbugs when a tenant terminates occupancy of the unit.  If the owner ascertains the presence of bedbugs, of which the owner has not received notice pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the presence of bedbugs may constitute damages to the unit beyond normal wear and tear, and the owner may itemize and deduct from the tenant's security deposit pursuant to section 3 of P.L.1971, c.223 (C.46:8-21.1), provided that the landlord has complied with the procedures set forth in section 4 of P.L.1975, c.310 (C.46:8-46). c.     The owner may also deduct from the security deposit any costs for eradication services for which the tenant is responsible pursuant to section 7 of P.L.    , c.   (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and that are due and owing to the landlord, provided that the landlord has complied with the procedures set forth in section 4 of P.L.1975, c.310 (C.46:8-46). 7.    (New section)  If repeated eradications are necessary due to the tenant's failure to properly maintain the dwelling, the costs of eradication may be charged to the tenant, provided that the landlord has complied with the procedures set forth in subsection c. of section 3 of P.L.    , c.    (C.    ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 8.    (New section)  a.  Any owner of a multiple dwelling whose negligence or failure to act results in action by the local health officer pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c. (C.         ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $300 for each affected dwelling unit and not more than $1000 for each affected common area in the multiple dwelling. Such penalty shall be recovered by and in the name of the local board of health, if one exists.  If no local board exists, the penalty shall be paid into the treasury of the municipality in which the violation occurred for the general uses of the municipality. b.    The local board or local health officer may bring an action in a summary manner pursuant to the "Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999," P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), and the Rules Governing the Courts of the State of New Jersey governing actions for the collection of civil penalties, in the municipal court or the Superior Court to recover a penalty imposed pursuant to subsection a. of this section.  The court is empowered to issue any appropriate injunctive orders, and to authorize immediate collection of reimbursable costs due the local board. 9.    (New section)  The commissioner, in consultation with the Department of Community Affairs, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this act. 10.  R.S.26:3-46 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-46.      The local board, within its jurisdiction, shall examine into and prohibit any nuisance, offensive matter, foul or noxious odors, gases or vapors, water in which mosquito larvae breed, and all causes of ill health or disease, including bedbugs, which may be known to  the board or brought to its attention, which, in its opinion, are injurious to  the health of the inhabitants therein, and shall cause the same to be removed and abated at the expense of the owner. (cf: R.S.26:3-46) 11.  R.S.26:3-49 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-49.      Whenever any nuisance, noxious gases or vapors, water in which mosquito larvae breed, or cause of ill health or disease is found on private property, the local board shall notify the owner to remove and abate the same, at his own  expense, within such time as the board may specify.  A duplicate of the notice  shall be left with one or more of the tenants or occupants.  Whenever any infestation of bedbugs is found in a multiple dwelling, the local board shall notify the owner to eradicate the infestation, at his own expense, immediately. If the owner resides out of the state or cannot be so notified speedily, a notice left at the house or premises with the tenant or occupant, or posted on the premises, shall suffice. In the event that an owner does not eradicate an infestation of bedbugs immediately following notice pursuant to this section, the local board of health is authorized to act as an a agent for the landlord, pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.   (C.        ), for purposes of eradicating the infestation. (cf: R.S.26:3-49) 12.  R.S.26:3-54 is amended to read as follows: 26:3-54.      The local board may recover, by a civil action, the expenses incurred in such removal and abatement from any person who shall have caused or allowed such nuisance, source of foulness, water in which mosquito larvae breed, or cause of sickness, hazardous to the public health to exist, or from any owner, tenant, or occupant of premises who, after notice as herein provided, shall fail to remove and abate the same within the time specified in the notice.  The  local board may recover, by a civil action, the expenses incurred in eradication of an infestation of bedbugs, pursuant to section 5 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ), from the owner of  a multiple dwelling who, after notice, failed to eradicate the infestation of bedbugs. (cf: P.L.1953, c.26, s.14) 13.  Section 7 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-7) is amended to read as follows: 7.    The commissioner shall issue and promulgate, in the manner specified in section 8 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-8), such regulations as the commissioner may deem necessary to assure that any hotel or multiple dwelling will be maintained in such manner as is consistent with, and will protect, the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or intended occupants thereof, or of the public generally. Any such regulations issued and promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this section shall provide standards and specifications for such maintenance materials, methods and techniques, fire warning and extinguisher systems, elevator systems, emergency egresses, and such other protective equipment as the commissioner shall deem reasonably necessary to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants or intended occupants of any units of dwelling space in any hotel or multiple dwelling, including but not limited to: (a)   Structural adequacy ratings; (b)   Methods of egress, including fire escapes, outside fireproof stairways, independent stairways, and handrails, railings, brackets, braces and landing platforms thereon, additional stairways, and treads, winders, and risers thereof, entrances and ramps; (c)   Bulkheads and scuttles, partitions, walls, ceilings and floors; (d)   Garbage and refuse collection and disposal, cleaning and janitorial services, repairs, and extermination services; (e)   Electrical wiring and outlets, and paints and the composition thereof; (f)   Doors, and the manner of opening thereof; (g)   Transoms, windows, shafts and beams; (h)   Chimneys, flues and central heating units; (i)    Roofing and siding materials; (j)    Lots, yards, courts and garages, including the size and location thereof; (k)   Intakes, open ducts, offsets and recesses; (l)    Windows, including the size and height thereof; (m) Rooms, including the area and height thereof, and the permissible number of occupants thereof; (n)   Stairwells, skylights and alcoves; (o)   Public halls, including the lighting and ventilation thereof; (p)   Accessory passages to rooms; (q)   Cellars, drainage and air space; (r)    Water-closets, bathrooms and sinks; (s)   Water connections, including the provision of drinking and hot and cold running water; (t)    Sewer connections, privies, cesspools, and private sewers; (u)   Rain water and drainage conductors; (v)   Entrances and ramps; [and] (w)  Presence of lead-based paint hazards in multiple dwellings and in single-family and two-family dwellings, exclusive of owner-occupied dwelling units, subject to P.L.2003, c.311 (C.52:27D-437.1 et al.).  In a common interest community, any inspection fee for and violation found within a unit which is solely related to this subsection shall be the responsibility of the unit owner and not the homeowners' association, unless the association is the owner of the unit; and (x)   Presence of bedbugs, as defined in section 2 of P.L.    , c.   (C.       ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), or the presence of other vermin and pests in multiple dwellings. (cf: P.L.2007, c.251, s.5) 14.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would require owners of multiple dwellings to maintain a safe and clean living environment free of the presence of bedbugs.  This legislation provides that property owners are responsible for maintaining multiple dwellings free of bedbug infestations, and must remove bedbugs at their own expense when they become aware of an infestation in a multiple dwelling. This bill provides that a landlord who does not take prompt action upon written notice that bedbugs have infested a property is financially liable for the consequences. The Department of Health is charged with preparing and publishing a bedbug education document in pamphlet form.  The legislation would require multiple dwelling owners to provide tenants with this pamphlet within 90 days after the department makes it available to the public.  Owners of multiple dwellings would be required to deliver this pamphlet to tenants, who would be required to sign an acknowledgment that they received this document.  If an owner is unable to obtain a signature, the owner shall be deemed in compliance with the delivery requirement if two attempts are made to deliver the pamphlet, one of which shall be by certified or registered mail. This publication would set forth the legal rights and responsibilities of both owners and tenants imposed by this legislation. The pamphlet would advise tenants that their units may be subject to inspection for bedbugs and that the tenants may be responsible for certain costs related to bedbug eradication. If enacted, this legislation would require the owner to deliver the pamphlet before charging certain expenses to tenants or deducting certain expenses from tenants' security deposits. This bill requires owners to act to eradicate bedbugs within 10 days of receiving written notice of the presence of bedbugs in a unit.  When a unit is rented for seasonal use, the owner would have only seven days to act.  This bill also requires the owner of a multiple dwelling to provide the tenant with 48 hours' notice that access is required to a unit for purposes of eradicating the presence of bedbugs prior to entering the unit for purposes of inspecting for or eradicating bedbugs. This legislation imposes a duty on tenants to notify the owner of the presence of bedbugs in the unit. This legislation also would require a local board of health to act on the owner's behalf to eradicate the presence bedbugs when an owner does not do so.  This bill has no financial impact on taxpayers because the property owner is required to reimburse the board when it acts on the owner's behalf.
