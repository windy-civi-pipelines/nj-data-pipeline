Possession of altered property.  Any dealer in property who knew or should have known that the identifying features such as serial numbers and permanently affixed labels of property in his possession have been removed or altered without the consent of the manufacturer is guilty of possession of altered property.  It is a defense to a prosecution under this subsection that a person lawfully possesses the usual indicia of ownership in addition to mere possession. b. (1) Dealing in stolen property.  A person is guilty of dealing in stolen property if he traffics in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages or supervises trafficking in stolen property, including through the use of an online platform via any electronic device or through a social media site.  This paragraph shall not apply to dealing in stolen property consisting of a domestic companion animal, addressed in paragraph (2) of this subsection. (2)   Dealing in stolen domestic companion animals.  A person is guilty of dealing in stolen domestic companion animals if he trafficks in, or initiates, organizes, plans, finances, directs, manages or supervises trafficking in stolen property consisting of a domestic companion animal. c. (1) For any violation of this section, other than dealing in stolen domestic companion animals, the value of the property involved in the violation shall be determined by the trier of fact for the purpose of determining the grade of the offense, and the value of the property involved in the violation may be aggregated in determining the grade of the offense where the acts or conduct constituting a violation were committed pursuant to one scheme or course of conduct, whether from the same person or several persons. (2)   A violation of this section for dealing in stolen domestic companion animals constitutes a crime of the third degree. d.    It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that the actor: (1)   Was unaware that the property or service was that of another; (2)   Acted under an honest claim of right to the property or service involved or that he had a right to acquire or dispose of it as he did. e.     In addition to the presumptions contained in subsection b. of N.J.S.2C:20-7, the following presumptions are available in the prosecution for a fencing offense: (1)   Proof of the purchase or sale of property at a price substantially below its fair market value, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had been stolen; (2)   Proof of the purchase or sale of property by a dealer in that property, out of the regular course of business, or without the usual indicia of ownership other than mere possession, or the property or the job lot of which it is a part was bought, received, possessed or controlled in broken succession of title, so that it cannot be traced, by appropriate documents, in unbroken succession to the manufacturer, in all cases where the regular course of business reasonably indicates records of purchase, transfer or sale, unless satisfactorily explained, gives rise to an inference that the person buying or selling the property knew that it had been stolen; and (3)   Proof that a person buying or selling property of the sort received obtained such property without having ascertained by reasonable inquiry that the person from whom he obtained it had a legal right to possess or control it gives rise to an inference that such person knew that it had been stolen. (cf: P.L.2017, c.156, s.1) 2.    (New section) a.  A person is guilty of fostering the sale of stolen property, a disorderly persons offense, if the person: (1)   hosts, advertises, or otherwise assists in the sale of stolen goods, including through an online platform; and (2) knows or reasonably should know that the property was stolen.  The requisite knowledge is presumed in the case of a person who undertook a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the persons actions would result in the sale of stolen property. b.    As defined in this act: Online platform means any public-facing Internet website, Internet web application, or computer or mobile application, including a social networking website or publication. Sale means any sale, transfer, exchange, barter, or offer for sale and distribution, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, including, but not limited to, via an online platform. Stolen property shall have the same meaning as defined pursuant to N.J.S.2C:20-1. 3.    N.J.S.2C:12-1 is amended as follows: 2C:12-1.  Assault. a.

Gift Card Fraud The bill imposes certain packaging requirements for the sale of open and closed-loop gift cards and requires the Division of Consumer Affairs (DCA) in the Department of Law and Public Safety to create a notice related to gift card fraud for dissemination in locations which sell gift cards. The bill defines closed-loop gift card as a gift card, code or device that is: (1) issued to a consumer on a prepaid basis primarily for personal, family, or household purposes in a specified amount, regardless of whether that amount may be increased or reloaded in exchange for payment; and (2) redeemable on presentation by a consumer at a single retail mercantile establishment or a group of affiliated retail mercantile establishments.  Further, the bill defines open-loop gift card as a card, code, or device that is: (1) issued to a consumer on a prepaid basis primarily for personal, family, or household purposes in a specified amount, regardless of whether that amount may be increased or reloaded in exchange for payment; (2) payment card network branded; and (3) redeemable on presentation at multiple unaffiliated merchants for goods or services within the payment card network or usable at an automated teller machine. The bill prohibits a retail mercantile establish from knowingly selling an open- or closed-loop gift card to a consumer unless the establishment conspicuously displays the notice provided by the DCA and the packaging of the gift card meets certain requirements in the bill. Further, the bill establishes requirements as it relates to third-party gift card resellers.  The bill defines third-party gift card reseller as a merchant who, without authorization from or affiliation with the business entity issuing an open- or closed-loop gift card, is engaged in the business of: (1) buying open- or closed-loop gift cards on behalf of consumers; or (2) reselling open- or closed-loop gift cards to consumers. These resellers are subject to certain record maintenance requirements. A retail mercantile establishment that violates the provisions of N.J.S.A.56:8-110.1 et seq. or the provisions of the bill related to open- or closed-loop gift card fraud is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000. Organized Retail Theft Unit Finally, the bill requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Criminal Justice, to establish a unit or other appropriate office to combat organized retail theft.  The unit, and the Division of Criminal Justice, will have the authority to (1) investigate and, if warranted, prosecute cases concerning acts of retail theft; and (2) assist county prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of acts of retail theft.

The bill prohibits a retail mercantile establish from knowingly selling an open- or closed-loop gift card to a consumer unless the establishment conspicuously displays the notice provided by the DCA and the packaging of the gift card meets certain requirements in the bill. Further, the bill establishes requirements as it relates to third-party gift card resellers.  The bill defines third-party gift card reseller as a merchant who, without authorization from or affiliation with the business entity issuing an open- or closed-loop gift card, is engaged in the business of: (1) buying open- or closed-loop gift cards on behalf of consumers; or (2) reselling open- or closed-loop gift cards to consumers. These resellers are subject to certain record maintenance requirements. A retail mercantile establishment that violates the provisions of N.J.S.A.56:8-110.1 et seq. or the provisions of the bill related to open- or closed-loop gift card fraud is subject to a civil penalty of $1,000. Organized Retail Theft Unit Finally, the bill requires the Attorney General, in consultation with the Director of the Division of Criminal Justice, to establish a unit or other appropriate office to combat organized retail theft.  The unit, and the Division of Criminal Justice, will have the authority to (1) investigate and, if warranted, prosecute cases concerning acts of retail theft; and (2) assist county prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of acts of retail theft.
