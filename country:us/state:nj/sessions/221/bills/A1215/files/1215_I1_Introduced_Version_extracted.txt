Lastly, the bill provides that dental therapists can bill or file a claim for certain services performed within the scope of practice of dental therapy.  Moreover, the NJ FamilyCare Program is to provide coverage for dental therapy under certain circumstances. A states Medicaid program, including the NJ FamilyCare Program, is required, under federal law, to cover services provided at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC).  Dental therapy services provided at a FQHC, in accordance with federal law and the provisions of this bill, will be covered by the NJ FamilyCare Program.
