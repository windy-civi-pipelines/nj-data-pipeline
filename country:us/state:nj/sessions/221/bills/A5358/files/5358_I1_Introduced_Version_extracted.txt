(1)  For any employee hired by an employer more than six months after the board opens the program for enrollment, the employer shall enroll the employee in the program no later than three months following the date of hire of the employee, unless the employee opts out of enrollment in the program prior to being enrolled. (2)   Any newly hired employee who has previously been enrolled in the program shall have the option of making direct contributions into that employee's existing account, provided that paragraph (1) of this subsection also applies to the employer of a newly hired employee who has been previously enrolled in the program. g.    An employee who opts out of the program who subsequently wants to participate through the participating employer's payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement may only enroll during the participating employer's designated open enrollment period or if permitted by the participating employer at an earlier time. h.    Employers shall retain the option at all times to set up or provide coverage under any type of employer-sponsored retirement plan or to elect to offer coverage through a plan sponsored by an employee leasing company or professional employer organization with which that employer has an employee leasing agreement or professional employer agreement as such terms are defined in section 1 of P.L.2001, c.260 (C. 34:8-67), such as a defined benefit plan or a 401(k), Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan, or Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) plan, or to offer an automatic enrollment payroll deduction IRA, instead of having a payroll deposit retirement savings arrangement to allow employee participation in the program. i.     An employee may terminate his or her participation in the program at any time in a manner prescribed by the board. j.     The board may establish and maintain an Internet website designed to assist employers in identifying private sector providers of retirement arrangements that can be set up by the employer rather than allowing employee participation in the program under this act.  The board shall provide public notice of the availability of and the process for inclusion on the Internet website before it becomes publicly available. k.    Each employer is responsible for the tasks described in subsections a. and b. of this section, but the employer is permitted to contract with a third party, such as a payroll service provider or a professional employer organization, to perform those tasks on behalf of the employer. (cf: P.L.2019, c.56, s.14) 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month after enactment. STATEMENT The bill reduces the threshold for required participation in the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program from businesses that have 25 or more employees to businesses that have one or more employees.      The bill removes references to the term small employer in the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program Act to reflect this change.
