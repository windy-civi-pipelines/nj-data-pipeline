<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.  R.S.54:5-33 is amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54:5-33.  <u>a.</u>  Payment
for the sale shall be made before the conclusion of the sale, or the property
shall be resold.  Any premium payment shall be held by the collector and
returned to the purchaser of the fee if and when redemption is made.  If
redemption is not made within five years from date of sale the premium payment
shall be turned over to the treasurer of the municipality and become a part of
the funds of the municipality.  In the event that a petition of bankruptcy has
been filed by the property owner, the five year limitation shall be extended
for each day that the foreclosure action is precluded by that bankruptcy
filing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.  If the tax sale certificate
is redeemed through a judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a
mortgage or through an Internet auction through the office of the county
sheriff, and the redemption is made within five years of the date of the tax
sale, the tax collector shall refund the premium to the holder of the tax sale
certificate.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>In the event that the
holder of the tax sale certificate, or an assignee, is the successful bidder at
the judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage<b> </b>or
an Internet auction through the office of the county sheriff, the tax collector
shall not refund any premium.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>(cf:  P.L.2009, c.320, s.7)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.  R.S.54:5-87 is amended to
read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     54:5-87.  <u>a.</u>  The
Superior Court, in an action to foreclose the right of redemption, may give
full and complete relief under this chapter, in accordance with other statutory
authority of the court, to bar the right of redemption and to foreclose all
prior or subsequent alienations and descents of the lands and encumbrances
thereon, except subsequent municipal liens, and to adjudge an absolute and
indefeasible estate of inheritance in fee simple, to be vested in the
purchaser.  The judgment shall be final upon the defendants, their heirs,
devisees and personal representatives, and their or any of their heirs,
devisees, executors, administrators, grantees, assigns or successors in right,
title or interest and no application shall be entertained to reopen the
judgment after three months from the date thereof, and then only upon the
grounds of lack of jurisdiction or fraud in the conduct of the suit.  Such
judgment and recording thereof shall not be deemed a sale, transfer, or
conveyance of title or interest to the subject property under the provisions of
the &quot;Uniform Voidable Transactions Act,&quot; R.S.25:2-20 et seq.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>b.  In order to preserve
any equity that may exist in the property being foreclosed, the owner, or the
owners heirs, shall have the right to demand, by written request to the
Superior Court no later than 45 days after being served with the foreclosure
complaint, that the holder of the tax sale certificate foreclose the right to
redeem that certificate in the same manner as a mortgage, through a judicial
sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage of the property through the
office of the county sheriff, or in the alternative, through an Internet
auction of the property through the office of the county sheriff.  The final
judgment shall provide for a writ of execution to the sheriff of the county in
which the property is located, and the holding of either a judicial sale as in
the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage, or an Internet auction.  In the
event that the owner or the owners heirs do not demand a judicial sale as in
the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage, or an Internet auction, the owner
of the tax sale certificate may proceed under subsection a. of this section and
foreclose without a judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a
mortgage, and the owner and the owners heirs shall have no claim against the
holder of the tax sale certificate for any equity in the property.  The amount
received through the judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a
mortgage<b>, </b>or through the Internet auction, as appropriate, shall be
conclusively presumed to be the fair market value of the property.  In the
event that no one bids on the property through the judicial sale as in the
manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage or at the Internet auction<b>,</b> and
the owner of the tax sale certificate obtains fee title from the sheriff, it
shall be conclusively presumed that there is no equity in the property.  In the
event that the sheriff has not established an Internet auction, the defendant
shall only be entitled to a judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure
of a mortgage.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <u>The sheriff of the county
shall deposit with the clerk of the Superior Court any surplus funds derived from
the judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage or the
Internet auction, as appropriate, after the holder of the tax sale certificate
has been paid the redemption moneys, allowable costs, and attorneys fees as
set forth by the court in the final judgment of foreclosure.  The sheriff shall
deduct the costs to the office of the county sheriff of holding the judicial
sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage or Internet auction, as
appropriate, have been withheld by the sheriff from those funds.  All
subsequent lienholders named in the foreclosure shall have the right to file a
motion in the Superior Court for any surplus funds, in the order of their
priority, not later than the first day of the seventh month next following the
issuance of the sheriffs deed.  The owner, or the owners heirs, shall be entitled
to any remaining surplus, and shall be entitled to file a motion to the court
for the payment of the surplus.  After five years from the date of the judicial
sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage, the clerk of the court
shall pay any unclaimed monies to the holder of the tax sale certificate.  If

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would revise the
tax sale law, R.S.54:5-1 et seq., and the In Rem Tax Foreclosure Act (1948),
P.L.1948, c.96 (C.54:5-104.29 et seq.), to bring those laws into compliance
with the recent United States Supreme Court decision in <u>Tyler v. Hennepin
County, Minnesota, et al.</u>, 143 S. Ct. 1369 (2023) concerning the ability of
a property owner, whose right to redeem a tax lien on their property has been
foreclosed by the holder of a tax sale certificate, to receive any of the
owners equity remaining in the property after the tax lien foreclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under current State law, the
holder of a tax sale certificate, after six months, in the case of a
municipality that holds the tax sale certificate or in the case of the holder
of a tax sale certificate on a property that is abandoned, or after two years,
in the case of a third party lienholder, may file suit in Superior Court to
foreclose the right of the property owner to redeem the tax lien.  Upon the
foreclosure, the lienholder will receive title to the property and all of the
equity remaining in the property, leaving the former property owner with no
funds from the foreclosure with which to purchase another property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     In the <u>Tyler</u> decision,
the Supreme Court determined that Hennepin County could not keep the equity in
the property beyond the amount it was owed for overdue property taxes and
interest thereon.  Under the Courts ruling, that excess equity was considered
as property that could not be taken from the former property owner consistent
with the takings clause restrictions of the 5th Amendment of the United States
Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend current
law to permit a property owner to require a judicial sale as in the manner of
the foreclosure of a mortgage of the property by the county sheriff in the same
manner as mortgage foreclosures are subject to a judicial sale as in the manner
of the foreclosure of a mortgage, or an Internet auction of the property
through the office of the county sheriff.  The property owner would have to
make a motion to the Superior Court for either a judicial sale as in the manner
of the foreclosure of a mortgage or an Internet auction of the property by the
office of the county sheriff within 45 days of receiving the complaint for
foreclosure or, in the case of an in rem foreclosure, within 45 days of
receiving the complaint for foreclosure or the publication of the notice of
foreclosure as required by law, whichever date is later.  The property owner
would be advised of this information, in boldface type, with the service of the
complaint for foreclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would not require a judicial
sale as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage or an Internet auction
of the property through the office of the county sheriff if the property owner
does not make a demand for one.  This would save the lien holder from incurring
substantial costs associated with a judicial sale as in the manner of the foreclosure
of a mortgage or Internet auction of the property through the office of the
county sheriff.  Many owners have no equity in their property to protect during
a tax lien foreclosure.  However, any property owner who wants a judicial sale
as in the manner of the foreclosure of a mortgage or an Internet auction of the
property through the office of the county sheriff will be able to obtain one by
simply requesting one from the court. </p>
