<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill revises certain
requirements related to cash assistance benefits under the Work First New
Jersey (WFNJ) program.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, when
determining whether good cause exists to excuse noncompliance with program
requirements, good cause is to be considered broadly in consideration of the
recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other
factors as determined by the commissioner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill updates references in
the current law that use the term alien to instead read immigrant, and
harmonizes a language discrepancy between the definition of eligible
immigrant in section 3 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-57) and the definition of
eligible immigrant in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.14 (C.44:10-44).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the
requirements concerning provision of child support to an assistance unit to
provide that the amount of child support will be based on the number of
children in the assistance unit.  The bill removes a requirement that the
amount of pass-through child support be based on regulations adopted by the
Commissioner of Human Services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises language
setting forth the general purposes and goals of the WFNJ program to provide
that the purpose of the program is to provide recipients with the
opportunities, training, and work skills needed to help elevate them out of
poverty.  The bill removes certain language concerning how the program
interacts with young parents and how the system can be disruptive to the family
structure, as well as language stating that the program is consistent with
federal law by including a time limit on benefits, work requirements, enhanced
measures to determine paternity, enhanced child support collection, sanctions
for noncompliance with program requirements, incentives for teenage parents to
complete school, and restrictions on eligibility for aliens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill reduces the hourly
requirement for work activity from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week, and
provides that the maximum aggregate requirement is 20 hours per week for
assistance units with a child under six years of age.  Current law provides for
a deferral from the work activity requirement for parents and relatives caring
for a child under 12 weeks of age; the bill extends this deferral to apply to
parents and relatives caring for a child under one year of age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill revises the sanctions
that may be imposed for non-compliance with program requirements to provide
that an adult beneficiary who is not in compliance will have up to six months
to actively cooperate or participate, or demonstrate good cause for
non-compliance, before the adult beneficiarys pro-rata share of the benefits
amount for the assistance unit will be suspended.  Under current law, the
adults pro rata share may be suspended for non-compliance after one month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill removes outdated
language in the definition of dependent child that required a child in school
or vocational training to reasonably be expected to complete the school or
training.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that,
commencing July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Human Services will be required to
conduct an annual assessment of the real cost of living and actual deprivation
as reflected in the current standard of need established pursuant to section 9
of P.L.1997, c.13 (C.44:10-42); the commissioner will be required to transmit
this assessment to the Legislature for consideration when deciding on
appropriations to fund cash assistance benefits.  In no case may benefit
amounts be reduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill grants the
Commissioner of Human Services emergency rulemaking authority to adopt rules
and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill, which emergency rules
will be in effect for no more than one year, after which the commissioner will
be required to amend, adopt, or readopt the emergency rules in accordance with
the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
