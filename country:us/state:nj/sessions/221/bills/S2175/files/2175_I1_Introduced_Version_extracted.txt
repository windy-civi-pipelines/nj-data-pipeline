The participation rate shall be calculated in accordance with federal requirements.  A recipient may be required to participate in one or more work activities for a maximum aggregate hourly total of [40] 30 hours per week, except that, if a child in the assistance unit is under six years of age, the maximum aggregate hourly total of work activities required for the recipient shall be 20 hours per week. d.    A recipient shall not be required to engage in a work activity if child care, including the unavailability of after-school child care for children over six years of age, is unavailable for the recipient's dependent child, as determined by regulation of the commissioner. e.     A recipient may temporarily be deferred from work activity requirements as provided for by the commissioner if the recipient is: (1)   a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy; (2)   a person certified by an examining legally licensed physician or legally licensed certified nurse midwife, acting within the scope of the practitioner's profession, to be unable, by reason of a physical or mental defect, disease or impairment, to engage in any gainful occupation for any period less than 12 months; or (3)   the parent or relative of a child under [the] one year of age [of 12 weeks] who is providing care for that child, except that, the deferral may be extended for an appropriate period of time if determined to be medically necessary for the parent or child. f.     Upon a determination of eligibility for benefits, each adult recipient not otherwise deferred or exempted under this act shall be given an assessment of that person's potential and readiness for work, including, but not limited to, skills, education, past work experience and any barriers to securing employment, including a screening and assessment for substance abuse, as appropriate.  For all recipients not deferred or exempt, an annual individual responsibility plan shall be developed jointly by the county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, and the recipient specifying the steps that will be taken by each to assist the recipient to secure employment.  The individual responsibility plan shall include specific goals for each adult member or minor parent in the assistance unit, and may include specific goals for a dependent child member of the assistance unit.  The goals, as determined by regulation of the commissioner, shall include, but not be limited to, requirements for parental participation in a dependent child's primary school program, immunizations for a dependent child, and regular school attendance by a dependent child.  Recipients who are job ready shall be placed immediately in a self-directed job search.  Within the amount of funds allocated by the commissioner for this purpose, other recipients shall be placed in an appropriate work activity as indicated by their individual assessments. g.    The county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, shall ensure the provision of necessary case management for recipients, as appropriate to their degree of job readiness, pursuant to regulations adopted by the commissioner.  The most intensive case management shall be directed to those recipients facing the most serious barriers to employment. h.    (1)   A recipient shall not be placed or utilized in a position at a particular workplace: (a)   that was previously filled by a regular employee if that position, or a substantially similar position at that workplace, has been made vacant through a demotion, substantial reduction of hours or a layoff of a regular employee in the previous 12 months, or has been eliminated by the employer at any time during the previous 12 months; (b)   in a manner that infringes upon a wage rate or an employment benefit, or violates the contractual overtime provisions of a regular employee at that workplace; (c)   in a manner that violates an existing collective bargaining agreement or a statutory provision that applies to that workplace; (d)   in a manner that supplants or duplicates a position in an existing, approved apprenticeship program; (e)   by or through an employment agency or temporary help service firm as a community work experience or alternative work experience worker; (f)   if there is a contractual or statutory recall right to that position at that workplace; or (g)   if there is an ongoing strike or lockout at that workplace. (2)   A person who believes that he has been adversely affected by a violation of this subsection, or the organization that is duly authorized to represent the collective bargaining unit to which that person belongs, shall be afforded an opportunity to meet with a designee of the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or the Governor's Office of Employee Relations, as appropriate.  The designee shall attempt to resolve the complaint of the alleged violation within 30 days of the date of the request for the meeting.  The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation with the Governor's Office of Employee Relations, shall adopt regulations to effectuate the provisions of this subsection.  In the event that the complaint is not resolved within the 30-day period, the complainant may appeal to the New Jersey State Board of Mediation in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development for expedited binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the board.  If the arbitrator determines that a violation has occurred, he shall provide an appropriate remedy.  The cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally by both parties to the dispute. (3)   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a collective bargaining agreement from containing additional protections for a regular employee. i.     The commissioner, acting in conjunction with the Commissioners of Banking and Insurance, Community Affairs, Education, Health [and Senior Services], Labor and Workforce Development, and Transportation, shall implement all elements of the program and establish initiatives to assist in moving recipients towards self-sufficiency. j.     The commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the program meets the requirements to qualify for the maximum amount of federal funds due the State under Pub.L.104-193 (42 U.S.C. s. 601 et seq.). k.    The commissioner is authorized to seek such waivers from the federal government as are necessary to accomplish the goals of the program. (cf: P.L.2009, c.114, s.3) 9.   Section 2 of P.L.2007, c.97 (C.44:10-63.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.   In an assistance unit with a single adult or couple without dependent children or a single adult or couple with dependent children, the failure of a recipient to actively cooperate with the Work First New Jersey program, established pursuant to P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-55 et seq.), or participate in work activities under the program, without good cause as determined by the commissioner, shall result in a loss of cash assistance benefits in accordance with the provisions of this section. Prior to the imposition of a sanction, the county or municipal welfare agency shall determine whether good cause for noncompliance exists.  Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, disability or other circumstances, as defined by the commissioner, which effectively impair a recipient's ability to actively cooperate with the Work First New Jersey program or participate in work activities under the program.  Good cause shall be considered broadly in consideration of the recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. a.   Prior to the imposition of a sanction, the county or municipal welfare agency shall ensure that, in consultation with the recipient, an assessment has been given in accordance with subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-62), and a determination has been made that barriers do not exist which are likely to prevent the recipient from complying with the work requirements or other activities specified in the individual responsibility plan; provided that, this prerequisite to the imposition of a sanction shall not apply if the recipient, without good cause, has refused to cooperate with the conduct of the assessment. The county or municipal welfare agency shall determine if a sanctionable offense has occurred and whether good cause exists by: (1)  reviewing the case record to determine whether a comprehensive assessment or other information in the file indicates that good cause for noncompliance exists, and (2)  outreaching to the recipient, to attempt, in consultation with the recipient, to determine the reason for noncompliance and whether it constitutes good cause. If good cause requires that services be provided in order for the recipient to comply, then services shall be provided prior to any reassignment of work activities, as appropriate. The recipient shall be provided with reasonable accommodations in work activities for identified disabilities and, when necessary given the condition, deferred from participation. The recipient shall be advised of the right to contest the sanction if he disagrees with the agency determination to impose the sanction. b.   In an assistance unit with one adult, if the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adult for one month or until such time as the adult actively cooperates or participates, or demonstrates good cause, whichever is greater. (1)  If the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the [first-month] sixth month of the pro-rata sanction, without good cause, the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be suspended for one month.  If the participant complies by the end of the suspension month, the suspension shall be lifted. (2)  If the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the suspension month, without good cause,  the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be closed for a minimum one-month period, and the assistance unit shall be required to reapply in order to receive further cash assistance benefits. c.   In an assistance unit with two adults, if one adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adult for one month.  If the adult fails to comply by the end of the sanction month, the pro-rata reduction shall continue until the recipient demonstrates an intent to comply. If both adults fail to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adults for one month or until such time as the adult actively cooperates or participates, or demonstrates good cause, whichever is greater.  If both adults fail to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the sixth month of the pro-rata sanction [month], without good cause, the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be closed for a minimum one-month period, and the assistance unit shall be required to reapply in order to receive further cash assistance benefits. d.   If a dependent child 16 years of age or older fails to comply with the requirement for school attendance or other work activity participation, without good cause, the dependent child shall be subject to a pro-rata reduction of cash assistance benefits for one month.  If the dependent child fails to comply by the end of the sanction month, the pro-rata reduction shall continue until the dependent child demonstrates an intent to comply. e.   If a cash assistance case is closed due to a sanction, and the recipient is receiving emergency assistance benefits, then the household shall continue to receive emergency assistance benefits for one month immediately following the case closure. If the recipient comes into compliance and reapplies for cash assistance benefits, the emergency assistance benefits shall be reinstated if the emergency still exists. f.    If a recipient who is less than 18 years of age is living in a Work First New Jersey-funded appropriate living arrangement because the recipient is unable to live with a parent, guardian, or other adult relative, funding for the living arrangement shall continue for one month immediately following the case closure. g.   An adult recipient who voluntarily quits a job without good cause, as defined by regulation of the commissioner, shall render the entire assistance unit ineligible for cash assistance benefits for a period of two months from the date the county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, makes the determination that the recipient quit the job. (cf: P.L.2007, c.97, s.2) 10.  (New section)  Commencing July 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Human Services shall assess the real cost of living and actual deprivation as reflected in the current standard of need established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1997, c.13 (C.44:10-42), which assessment shall be transmitted to the Legislature by the commissioner for consideration when deciding on appropriations to fund cash assistance benefits to recipients. 11.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the Commissioner of Human Services may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, regulations that the commissioner deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which regulations shall be effective for a period of 365 days from the date of the filing.  The commissioner shall thereafter amend, adopt, or readopt the regulations in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 12.  This act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises certain requirements related to cash assistance benefits under the Work First New Jersey (WFNJ) program. The bill provides that, when determining whether good cause exists to excuse noncompliance with program requirements, good cause is to be considered broadly in consideration of the recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. The bill updates references in the current law that use the term alien to instead read immigrant, and harmonizes a language discrepancy between the definition of eligible immigrant in section 3 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-57) and the definition of eligible immigrant in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.14 (C.44:10-44). The bill revises the requirements concerning provision of child support to an assistance unit to provide that the amount of child support will be based on the number of children in the assistance unit.  The bill removes a requirement that the amount of pass-through child support be based on regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Human Services. The bill revises language setting forth the general purposes and goals of the WFNJ program to provide that the purpose of the program is to provide recipients with the opportunities, training, and work skills needed to help elevate them out of poverty.  The bill removes certain language concerning how the program interacts with young parents and how the system can be disruptive to the family structure, as well as language stating that the program is consistent with federal law by including a time limit on benefits, work requirements, enhanced measures to determine paternity, enhanced child support collection, sanctions for noncompliance with program requirements, incentives for teenage parents to complete school, and restrictions on eligibility for aliens. The bill reduces the hourly requirement for work activity from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week, and provides that the maximum aggregate requirement is 20 hours per week for assistance units with a child under six years of age.  Current law provides for a deferral from the work activity requirement for parents and relatives caring for a child under 12 weeks of age; the bill extends this deferral to apply to parents and relatives caring for a child under one year of age. The bill revises the sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with program requirements to provide that an adult beneficiary who is not in compliance will have up to six months to actively cooperate or participate, or demonstrate good cause for non-compliance, before the adult beneficiarys pro-rata share of the benefits amount for the assistance unit will be suspended.  Under current law, the adults pro rata share may be suspended for non-compliance after one month. The bill removes outdated language in the definition of dependent child that required a child in school or vocational training to reasonably be expected to complete the school or training. The bill requires that, commencing July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Human Services will be required to conduct an annual assessment of the real cost of living and actual deprivation as reflected in the current standard of need established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1997, c.13 (C.44:10-42); the commissioner will be required to transmit this assessment to the Legislature for consideration when deciding on appropriations to fund cash assistance benefits.  In no case may benefit amounts be reduced. The bill grants the Commissioner of Human Services emergency rulemaking authority to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill, which emergency rules will be in effect for no more than one year, after which the commissioner will be required to amend, adopt, or readopt the emergency rules in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.

(cf: P.L.2008, c.101, s.2) 5.    Section 2 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-56) is amended to read as follows: 2.    The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The federal "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996," Pub.L.104-193, establishes the federal block grant for temporary assistance for needy families and provides the opportunity for a state to establish and design its own welfare program; b.    Work and the earning of income promote the best interests of families and children; c.     Working individuals and families needing temporary assistance should have the transitional support necessary to obtain and keep a job in order to be able to avoid cycling back [onto public assistance] into financial hardship, as well as the opportunity to acquire new skills and training and access job opportunities that will allow them to lift themselves out of poverty; d.    Teenage pregnancy is counter to the best interests of children; e.     Successful welfare reform [requires] is furthered by the active involvement of the private sector as well as all departments of State government; f.     Personal and family security and stability, including the protection of children and vulnerable adults, are important to the establishment and maintenance of successful family life and childhood development and a family's inability or failure to qualify for benefits under the Work First New Jersey program established pursuant to this act shall not in and of itself be the basis for the separation of a dependent child from his family or the justification for the resource family care placement of a dependent child; g.    Children and teenagers need the benefits of the support and guidance which a family structure provides [; the welfare system has provided a vehicle for breaking up families by giving teenage mothers the means to shift their financial dependence from their parents to the State; in the process, these youths deprive themselves of the education and family structure necessary to support themselves and their babies; and the] , which support and structure [provided by families are] is important to the development of a child's maximum potential; [and] h.    The Work First New Jersey program established pursuant to this act incorporates and builds upon the fundamental concepts of the Family Development Initiative established pursuant to P.L.1991, c.523 (C.44:10-19 et seq.) in a manner that is consistent with the federal program of temporary assistance for needy families [, by establishing requirements for: time limits on cash assistance; the participation of recipients in work activities; enhanced efforts to establish paternity and establish and enforce child support obligations; sanctions for failure to comply with program requirements; a cap on the use of funds for administrative costs; the maintenance of State and county financial support of the program; teenage parent recipients to live at home and finish high school; and restrictions on eligibility for benefits for aliens] ; and i.     Enhancing an individuals overall training and skill set, and providing opportunities for progressive advancement, will help the person to exit, and sustainably avoid, poverty far more effectively. (cf: P.L.2004, c.130, s.117) 6.   Section 3 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-57) is amended to read as follows: 3.   As used in this act: "Alternative work experience" means unpaid work and training  only with a public, private nonprofit or private charitable employer that provides a recipient with the experience necessary to adjust to, and learn how to function in, an employment setting and the opportunity to combine that experience with education and job training.  An alternative work experience participant shall not be assigned to work for a private, for profit employer.

(cf: P.L.1997, c.38, s.3) 7.    Section 5 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-59) is amended to read as follows: 5.    a.     All adult persons, except as otherwise provided by law governing the Work First New Jersey program, are charged with the primary responsibility of supporting and maintaining themselves and their dependents; the primary responsibility for the support and maintenance of minor children is that of the parents and family of those children; and benefits shall be provided only when other means of support and maintenance are not present to support the assistance unit. b.    Benefits shall be temporary and serve the primary goal of [fostering self-sufficiency] reducing poverty.  Failure to cooperate with any of the program eligibility requirements without good cause, as determined by the commissioner, shall result in ineligibility for benefits for some or all assistance unit members, provided that good cause shall be considered broadly in consideration of the recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. c.     If the county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, determines, based upon an applicant's written statement signed under oath, that the applicant is in immediate need of benefits because the applicant's available resources are insufficient, as determined by the commissioner, to meet the minimal current living expenses pursuant to regulations adopted by the commissioner, of the applicant's assistance unit, the county agency or municipal welfare agency shall issue cash assistance benefits to the applicant on the date of application, subject to the applicant meeting all other program eligibility requirements. d.    The commissioner shall establish by regulation, standards and procedures to screen and identify recipients with a history of being subjected to domestic violence and refer these recipients to counseling and supportive services.  The commissioner may waive program requirements, including, but not limited to, the  time limit on benefits pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1997, c.37 (C.44:10-72), residency requirements pursuant to section 6 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-60), child support cooperation requirements pursuant to subsection b. of section 2 of P.L.1997, c.14 (C.44:10-45) and the limitation on increase of cash assistance benefits as a result of the birth of a child pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-61), in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for a recipient to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize the recipient who is or has been victimized by such violence, or who is at risk of further domestic violence. e.     The commissioner shall establish regulations determining eligibility and other requirements of the Work First New Jersey program.  Regulations shall include provisions for the deeming of income, when appropriate, which include situations involving the sponsor of an eligible [alien] immigrant in accordance with federal law, and  legally responsible relatives of assistance unit members. (cf: P.L.1997, c.38, s.5) 8.    Section 8 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-62) is amended to read as follows: 8.    a.   As defined by the commissioner, each adult recipient shall continuously and actively seek employment in an effort to remove the assistance unit of which the recipient is a member from the program. A recipient may be assigned to a work activity as determined by the commissioner.  The recipient shall sign an individual responsibility plan, as provided in subsection f. of this section, in order to be able to participate in the program, which shall indicate the terms of the work activity requirements that the recipient must fulfill in order to continue to receive benefits. b.    In accordance with Pub.L.104-193 (42 U.S.C. s. 601 et seq.), a recipient in an assistance unit with dependent children shall commence participation in a work activity, self-directed job search or other activities as determined by the commissioner at some time prior to having received 24 months of benefits; except that if the recipient is a full-time post-secondary student in a course of study related to employment as defined by regulation of the commissioner, the recipient shall be required to engage in another work activity for no more than 15 hours a week, subject to the recipient making satisfactory progress toward the completion of the post-secondary course of study as determined by the commissioner. c.     A recipient shall comply with work activity participation requirements as a condition of remaining eligible for benefits.  In accordance with the requirements of Pub.L.104-193 (42 U.S.C. s. 601 et seq.), a minimum participation rate of 25% shall be realized in federal fiscal year 1997.  The participation rate shall increase by 5% in each federal fiscal year to a level of 50% in federal fiscal year 2002 and thereafter.  For two-parent assistance units with dependent children receiving benefits, the participation rate shall be 75% for federal fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and 90% in federal fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. The participation rate shall be calculated in accordance with federal requirements.  A recipient may be required to participate in one or more work activities for a maximum aggregate hourly total of [40] 30 hours per week, except that, if a child in the assistance unit is under six years of age, the maximum aggregate hourly total of work activities required for the recipient shall be 20 hours per week. d.    A recipient shall not be required to engage in a work activity if child care, including the unavailability of after-school child care for children over six years of age, is unavailable for the recipient's dependent child, as determined by regulation of the commissioner. e.     A recipient may temporarily be deferred from work activity requirements as provided for by the commissioner if the recipient is: (1)   a woman in the third trimester of pregnancy; (2)   a person certified by an examining legally licensed physician or legally licensed certified nurse midwife, acting within the scope of the practitioner's profession, to be unable, by reason of a physical or mental defect, disease or impairment, to engage in any gainful occupation for any period less than 12 months; or (3)   the parent or relative of a child under [the] one year of age [of 12 weeks] who is providing care for that child, except that, the deferral may be extended for an appropriate period of time if determined to be medically necessary for the parent or child. f.     Upon a determination of eligibility for benefits, each adult recipient not otherwise deferred or exempted under this act shall be given an assessment of that person's potential and readiness for work, including, but not limited to, skills, education, past work experience and any barriers to securing employment, including a screening and assessment for substance abuse, as appropriate.  For all recipients not deferred or exempt, an annual individual responsibility plan shall be developed jointly by the county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, and the recipient specifying the steps that will be taken by each to assist the recipient to secure employment.  The individual responsibility plan shall include specific goals for each adult member or minor parent in the assistance unit, and may include specific goals for a dependent child member of the assistance unit.  The goals, as determined by regulation of the commissioner, shall include, but not be limited to, requirements for parental participation in a dependent child's primary school program, immunizations for a dependent child, and regular school attendance by a dependent child.  Recipients who are job ready shall be placed immediately in a self-directed job search.  Within the amount of funds allocated by the commissioner for this purpose, other recipients shall be placed in an appropriate work activity as indicated by their individual assessments. g.    The county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, shall ensure the provision of necessary case management for recipients, as appropriate to their degree of job readiness, pursuant to regulations adopted by the commissioner.  The most intensive case management shall be directed to those recipients facing the most serious barriers to employment. h.    (1)   A recipient shall not be placed or utilized in a position at a particular workplace: (a)   that was previously filled by a regular employee if that position, or a substantially similar position at that workplace, has been made vacant through a demotion, substantial reduction of hours or a layoff of a regular employee in the previous 12 months, or has been eliminated by the employer at any time during the previous 12 months; (b)   in a manner that infringes upon a wage rate or an employment benefit, or violates the contractual overtime provisions of a regular employee at that workplace; (c)   in a manner that violates an existing collective bargaining agreement or a statutory provision that applies to that workplace; (d)   in a manner that supplants or duplicates a position in an existing, approved apprenticeship program; (e)   by or through an employment agency or temporary help service firm as a community work experience or alternative work experience worker; (f)   if there is a contractual or statutory recall right to that position at that workplace; or (g)   if there is an ongoing strike or lockout at that workplace. (2)   A person who believes that he has been adversely affected by a violation of this subsection, or the organization that is duly authorized to represent the collective bargaining unit to which that person belongs, shall be afforded an opportunity to meet with a designee of the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development or the Governor's Office of Employee Relations, as appropriate.  The designee shall attempt to resolve the complaint of the alleged violation within 30 days of the date of the request for the meeting.  The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation with the Governor's Office of Employee Relations, shall adopt regulations to effectuate the provisions of this subsection.  In the event that the complaint is not resolved within the 30-day period, the complainant may appeal to the New Jersey State Board of Mediation in the Department of Labor and Workforce Development for expedited binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the board.  If the arbitrator determines that a violation has occurred, he shall provide an appropriate remedy.  The cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally by both parties to the dispute. (3)   Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent a collective bargaining agreement from containing additional protections for a regular employee. i.     The commissioner, acting in conjunction with the Commissioners of Banking and Insurance, Community Affairs, Education, Health [and Senior Services], Labor and Workforce Development, and Transportation, shall implement all elements of the program and establish initiatives to assist in moving recipients towards self-sufficiency. j.     The commissioner shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the program meets the requirements to qualify for the maximum amount of federal funds due the State under Pub.L.104-193 (42 U.S.C. s. 601 et seq.). k.    The commissioner is authorized to seek such waivers from the federal government as are necessary to accomplish the goals of the program. (cf: P.L.2009, c.114, s.3) 9.   Section 2 of P.L.2007, c.97 (C.44:10-63.1) is amended to read as follows: 2.   In an assistance unit with a single adult or couple without dependent children or a single adult or couple with dependent children, the failure of a recipient to actively cooperate with the Work First New Jersey program, established pursuant to P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-55 et seq.), or participate in work activities under the program, without good cause as determined by the commissioner, shall result in a loss of cash assistance benefits in accordance with the provisions of this section. Prior to the imposition of a sanction, the county or municipal welfare agency shall determine whether good cause for noncompliance exists.  Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, disability or other circumstances, as defined by the commissioner, which effectively impair a recipient's ability to actively cooperate with the Work First New Jersey program or participate in work activities under the program.  Good cause shall be considered broadly in consideration of the recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. a.   Prior to the imposition of a sanction, the county or municipal welfare agency shall ensure that, in consultation with the recipient, an assessment has been given in accordance with subsection f. of section 8 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-62), and a determination has been made that barriers do not exist which are likely to prevent the recipient from complying with the work requirements or other activities specified in the individual responsibility plan; provided that, this prerequisite to the imposition of a sanction shall not apply if the recipient, without good cause, has refused to cooperate with the conduct of the assessment. The county or municipal welfare agency shall determine if a sanctionable offense has occurred and whether good cause exists by: (1)  reviewing the case record to determine whether a comprehensive assessment or other information in the file indicates that good cause for noncompliance exists, and (2)  outreaching to the recipient, to attempt, in consultation with the recipient, to determine the reason for noncompliance and whether it constitutes good cause. If good cause requires that services be provided in order for the recipient to comply, then services shall be provided prior to any reassignment of work activities, as appropriate. The recipient shall be provided with reasonable accommodations in work activities for identified disabilities and, when necessary given the condition, deferred from participation. The recipient shall be advised of the right to contest the sanction if he disagrees with the agency determination to impose the sanction. b.   In an assistance unit with one adult, if the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adult for one month or until such time as the adult actively cooperates or participates, or demonstrates good cause, whichever is greater. (1)  If the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the [first-month] sixth month of the pro-rata sanction, without good cause, the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be suspended for one month.  If the participant complies by the end of the suspension month, the suspension shall be lifted. (2)  If the adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the suspension month, without good cause,  the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be closed for a minimum one-month period, and the assistance unit shall be required to reapply in order to receive further cash assistance benefits. c.   In an assistance unit with two adults, if one adult fails to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adult for one month.  If the adult fails to comply by the end of the sanction month, the pro-rata reduction shall continue until the recipient demonstrates an intent to comply. If both adults fail to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities without good cause, the cash assistance benefit provided to the assistance unit shall be reduced by the pro-rata share of the noncompliant adults for one month or until such time as the adult actively cooperates or participates, or demonstrates good cause, whichever is greater.  If both adults fail to actively cooperate with the program or participate in work activities by the end of the sixth month of the pro-rata sanction [month], without good cause, the assistance unit's cash assistance case shall be closed for a minimum one-month period, and the assistance unit shall be required to reapply in order to receive further cash assistance benefits. d.   If a dependent child 16 years of age or older fails to comply with the requirement for school attendance or other work activity participation, without good cause, the dependent child shall be subject to a pro-rata reduction of cash assistance benefits for one month.  If the dependent child fails to comply by the end of the sanction month, the pro-rata reduction shall continue until the dependent child demonstrates an intent to comply. e.   If a cash assistance case is closed due to a sanction, and the recipient is receiving emergency assistance benefits, then the household shall continue to receive emergency assistance benefits for one month immediately following the case closure. If the recipient comes into compliance and reapplies for cash assistance benefits, the emergency assistance benefits shall be reinstated if the emergency still exists. f.    If a recipient who is less than 18 years of age is living in a Work First New Jersey-funded appropriate living arrangement because the recipient is unable to live with a parent, guardian, or other adult relative, funding for the living arrangement shall continue for one month immediately following the case closure. g.   An adult recipient who voluntarily quits a job without good cause, as defined by regulation of the commissioner, shall render the entire assistance unit ineligible for cash assistance benefits for a period of two months from the date the county agency or municipal welfare agency, as appropriate, makes the determination that the recipient quit the job. (cf: P.L.2007, c.97, s.2) 10.  (New section)  Commencing July 1, 2023, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Human Services shall assess the real cost of living and actual deprivation as reflected in the current standard of need established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1997, c.13 (C.44:10-42), which assessment shall be transmitted to the Legislature by the commissioner for consideration when deciding on appropriations to fund cash assistance benefits to recipients. 11.  (New section) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.) to the contrary, the Commissioner of Human Services may adopt, immediately upon filing with the Office of Administrative Law, regulations that the commissioner deems necessary to implement the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), which regulations shall be effective for a period of 365 days from the date of the filing.  The commissioner shall thereafter amend, adopt, or readopt the regulations in accordance with the requirements of P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.). 12.  This act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill revises certain requirements related to cash assistance benefits under the Work First New Jersey (WFNJ) program. The bill provides that, when determining whether good cause exists to excuse noncompliance with program requirements, good cause is to be considered broadly in consideration of the recipients health, safety, family needs, financial considerations, and other factors as determined by the commissioner. The bill updates references in the current law that use the term alien to instead read immigrant, and harmonizes a language discrepancy between the definition of eligible immigrant in section 3 of P.L.1997, c.38 (C.44:10-57) and the definition of eligible immigrant in section 1 of P.L.1997, c.14 (C.44:10-44). The bill revises the requirements concerning provision of child support to an assistance unit to provide that the amount of child support will be based on the number of children in the assistance unit.  The bill removes a requirement that the amount of pass-through child support be based on regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Human Services. The bill revises language setting forth the general purposes and goals of the WFNJ program to provide that the purpose of the program is to provide recipients with the opportunities, training, and work skills needed to help elevate them out of poverty.  The bill removes certain language concerning how the program interacts with young parents and how the system can be disruptive to the family structure, as well as language stating that the program is consistent with federal law by including a time limit on benefits, work requirements, enhanced measures to determine paternity, enhanced child support collection, sanctions for noncompliance with program requirements, incentives for teenage parents to complete school, and restrictions on eligibility for aliens. The bill reduces the hourly requirement for work activity from 40 hours per week to 30 hours per week, and provides that the maximum aggregate requirement is 20 hours per week for assistance units with a child under six years of age.  Current law provides for a deferral from the work activity requirement for parents and relatives caring for a child under 12 weeks of age; the bill extends this deferral to apply to parents and relatives caring for a child under one year of age. The bill revises the sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with program requirements to provide that an adult beneficiary who is not in compliance will have up to six months to actively cooperate or participate, or demonstrate good cause for non-compliance, before the adult beneficiarys pro-rata share of the benefits amount for the assistance unit will be suspended.  Under current law, the adults pro rata share may be suspended for non-compliance after one month. The bill removes outdated language in the definition of dependent child that required a child in school or vocational training to reasonably be expected to complete the school or training. The bill requires that, commencing July 1, 2023, the Commissioner of Human Services will be required to conduct an annual assessment of the real cost of living and actual deprivation as reflected in the current standard of need established pursuant to section 9 of P.L.1997, c.13 (C.44:10-42); the commissioner will be required to transmit this assessment to the Legislature for consideration when deciding on appropriations to fund cash assistance benefits.  In no case may benefit amounts be reduced. The bill grants the Commissioner of Human Services emergency rulemaking authority to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of the bill, which emergency rules will be in effect for no more than one year, after which the commissioner will be required to amend, adopt, or readopt the emergency rules in accordance with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
