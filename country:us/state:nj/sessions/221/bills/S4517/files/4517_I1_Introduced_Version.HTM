(cf: P.L.2021, c.391, s.14) 3. This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would amend existing law concerning the statewide ban on single-use disposable plastic carryout bags, single-use paper carryout bags, and polystyrene foam food service products to stipulate that certain compostable items, such as compostable carryout bags, compostable trash bags, and rigid compostable containers, would be exempt from the ban on single-use plastic carryout products. In addition, the bill would clarify that compostable containers, carryout bags, or trash bags would be exempt from the ban on single-use plastic products, provided that their organic composition is certified by any of several identified independent, nationally-recognized third party organizations, as enumerated in the bill.
