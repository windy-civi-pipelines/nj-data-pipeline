The bill also defines investment coin as any numismatic coin manufactured of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, or any other metal, including non-precious metals, and having a fair market value of not less than $1,000. However, the exemption would not apply to the sale of jewelry or works of art made of coins, nor would it apply the sale of commemorative medallions. The bill is also intended to treat investment metal bullion and investment coins similar to other investment instruments, such as stocks, which are not subject to sales tax.
