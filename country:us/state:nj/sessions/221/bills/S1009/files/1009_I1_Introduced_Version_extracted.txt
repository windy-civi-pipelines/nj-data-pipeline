BPA is an estrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptor used in the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics.  It has been shown to have hormone disrupting effects leading to developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune system health issues and is found to leach out of the products in which it is used.  BPA is sometimes used in the coating of business transaction receipts and may be transferred to the body of a person handling them, particularly if the receipt is wet.
