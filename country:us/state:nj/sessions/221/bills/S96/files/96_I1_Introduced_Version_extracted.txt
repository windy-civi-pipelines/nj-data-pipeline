the amount and type of emergency assistance delivered to the recipient; and the time period in which emergency assistance was provided to the recipient.  The information shall be compiled by the Division of Family Development on an annual basis and submitted to the Legislature no later than April 1 of the current calendar year for expenditures in the prior calendar year. f.     Recipients of emergency assistance benefits shall be notified, in writing, of any termination or modification of the recipient's emergency assistance benefits at least 30 days prior to the termination or modification of the recipient's emergency assistance benefits. g.    Section 9 of P.L.1997, c.14 (C.44:10-52) shall apply to any denial, termination, or modification of emergency assistance benefits. h.    Of the total revenues appropriated to the Division of Family Development in the Department of Human Services during any fiscal year, no more than $20 million shall be available for the cost of emergency assistance provided pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section, and no more than $5 million shall be available for the cost of case management services provided pursuant to subparagraph (b) of paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require that emergency assistance be awarded on any basis other than by the order in which applications are received.  In no case shall the monthly allotment of emergency assistance awarded to any individual be reduced based on the overall limit on emergency assistance funds established pursuant to this subsection, and no additional emergency assistance shall be awarded pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section once the overall limit on emergency assistance funds established pursuant to this subsection has been reached. i.     The commissioner shall annually report to the Legislature, pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1991, c.164 (C.52:14-19.1), the number of recipients deemed ineligible for emergency assistance on the grounds that the individual has reached the maximum period of emergency assistance allowed pursuant to this section, and the total number of months of emergency assistance provided by the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section. j.     In addition to any other types of emergency assistance, including temporary rental assistance, as defined in regulations and promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this section, temporary rental assistance may also be provided to a recipient, if appropriate for the individual or family situation, when the recipient is facing eviction and conditions in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection are met: (1)   Temporary rental assistance may be provided to maintain current permanent housing which had previously been affordable, but which is no longer affordable to the recipient for reasons including, but not limited to, loss of employment and temporary unemployment or underemployment; or (2)   Temporary rental assistance may be provided when it is determined that maintaining the unit in the current housing arrangement is both the least costly alternative and serves to preserve the family structure while the search for affordable housing continues. (cf: P.L.2019, c.74, s.1) 2.    The Commissioner of Human Services, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), shall adopt rules and regulations as the commissioner determines necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act. 3.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill provides that the recipients of emergency assistance may also receive temporary rental assistance, in addition to any other form of emergency assistance, in certain circumstances. Specifically, the bill provides that a recipient of emergency assistance may also receive temporary rental assistance if the person faces eviction and either of the following conditions are met: (1) the temporary rental assistance would be provided to maintain permanent housing, which is no longer affordable due to the loss of employment, temporary unemployment, underemployment, or other reasons; or (2) when it is determined that maintaining the unit in the current housing arrangement is the least costly alternative and preserves the family structure while the recipient searches for affordable housing.
