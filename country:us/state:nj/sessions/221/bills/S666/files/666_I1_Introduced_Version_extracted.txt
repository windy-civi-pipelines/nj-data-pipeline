Digital assets shall be classified in the following manner: (1)   Digital consumer assets are intangible personal property and shall be considered general intangibles, as defined in N.J.S.12A:9-102; (2)   Digital securities are intangible personal property and shall be considered securities, as defined in N.J.S.12A:8-102, and investment property, as defined in N.J.S.12A:9-102; and (3)   Virtual currency is intangible personal property and shall be considered money, notwithstanding N.J.S.12A:1-201. b.    Consistent with N.J.S.12A:8-102, a digital asset may be treated as a financial asset, pursuant to a written agreement with the owner of the digital asset. If treated as a financial asset, the digital asset shall remain intangible personal property. c.     Classification of digital assets under this section shall be construed in a manner to give the greatest effect to P.L.    , c.    (C.      ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), but shall not be construed to apply to any other asset. 5.    (New section)  a. Notwithstanding the financing statement requirement specified by N.J.S.12A:9-310, perfection of a security interest in a digital asset may be achieved through control, as defined in subsection e. of this section. A security interest held by a secured party having control of a digital asset has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have control of the asset. b.    Before a secured party may take control of a digital asset under this section, the secured party shall enter into a control agreement with the debtor.  A control agreement may also set forth the terms under which a secured party may pledge its security interest in the digital asset as collateral for another transaction. c.     A secured party may file a financing statement with the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services, including to perfect a security interest in proceeds from a digital asset pursuant to N.J.S.12A:9-315. d.    Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a transferee shall take a digital asset free of any security interest two years after the transferee takes the asset for value and does not have actual notice of an adverse claim. This subsection shall only apply to a security interest perfected by a method other than control. e.     Perfection by control creates a possessory security interest in a digital asset and does not require physical possession.  For purposes of this section, a digital asset is located within the State if the asset is held by a custodian, debtor or secured party that is physically located within the State. f.     As used in this section: "Control" means: (1)   a secured party, or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party, has the exclusive legal authority to conduct a transaction relating to a digital asset, including by means of a private key or the use of a multi signature arrangement authorized by the secured party; or (2)   a smart contract created by a secured party which has the exclusive legal authority to conduct a transaction relating to a digital asset. "Multi signature arrangement" means a system of access control relating to a digital asset for the purposes of preventing unauthorized transactions relating to the asset, in which two or more private keys are required to conduct a transaction, or any substantially similar analogue. "Private key" means a unique element of cryptographic data, or any substantially similar analogue, which is: (1)   held by a person; (2)   paired with a unique, publicly available element of cryptographic data; and (3)   associated with an algorithm that is necessary to carry out an encryption or decryption required to execute a transaction. Smart Contract means: (1)   an automated transaction conducted or performed, in whole or in part, by electronic means or electronic records, in which the acts or records of one or both parties are not reviewed by an individual in the ordinary course in forming a contract, performing under an existing contract or fulfilling an obligation required by the transaction; or (2)   any substantially similar analogue, which is comprised of code, script or programming language that executes the terms of an agreement, and which may include taking custody of and transferring an asset, or issuing executable instructions for these actions, based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of specified conditions. 6.    (New section)  a.  A bank may provide custodial services consistent with this section upon providing 60 days written notice to the Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance.  The provisions of this section are cumulative and not exclusive as an optional framework for enhanced supervision of digital asset custody.  If a bank elects to provide custodial services under this section, it shall comply with all provisions of this section. b.    A bank may serve as a qualified custodian under federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules established pursuant to 17 C.F.R. s.275.206(4).  In performing custodial services under this section, a bank shall: (1)   implement all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards specified by applicable state or federal law and regulations for custodial services; (2)   maintain information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in custody. The commissioner may specify required best practices by rule; (3)   fully comply with applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and beneficial ownership requirements; and (4)   take other actions necessary to carry out this section, which may include exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities. c.     A bank providing custodial services shall enter into an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination conforming to the requirements of 17 C.F.R. s.275.206(4) 2(a)(4) and (6), at the cost of the bank.  The accountant shall transmit the results of the examination to the commissioner within 120 days of the examination and may file the results with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as its rules may provide.  Material discrepancies in an examination shall be reported to the commissioner within one business day.  The commissioner shall review examination results upon receipt within a reasonable time and during any regular examination conducted pursuant to P.L.1948, c.67 (C.17:9A-260). d.    Digital assets held in custody pursuant to this section shall not be depository liabilities or assets of the bank. A bank, or a subsidiary, may register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer as necessary. A bank shall maintain control over a digital asset while in custody. A customer shall elect, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody: (1)   Custody under a bailment as a nonfungible or fungible asset. Assets held under this paragraph shall be strictly segregated from other assets; or (2)   Custody under a bailment pursuant to subsection e. of this section. e.     If a customer makes an election under subsection d. of this section, the bank may, based only on customer instructions, undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank maintains control pursuant to subsection d. of this section by entering into an agreement with the counterparty to a transaction which contains a time for return of the asset. The bank shall not be liable for any loss suffered with respect to a transaction under this subsection, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian under this section. f.     A bank and a customer shall agree in writing regarding the source code version the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset under chapter 8 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. Any ambiguity under this subsection shall be resolved in favor of the customer. g.    A bank shall provide clear, written notice to each customer, and require written acknowledgement, of the following: (1)   prior to the implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security vulnerabilities; (2)   the heightened risk of loss from transactions under subsection e. of this section; (3)   that some risk of loss as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset or custody under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section; (4)   that custody under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section may not result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from other customer assets; and (5)   that the bank is not liable for losses suffered under subsection e. of this section, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian under this section. h.    A bank and a customer shall agree in writing to a time period within which the bank shall return a digital asset held in custody under this section. If a customer makes an election under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section, then the bank and the customer may also agree in writing to the form in which the digital asset shall be returned. i.     All ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody under this section shall accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written agreement with the customer. The bank shall not collect ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, unless the collection is disclosed in writing. A customer who makes an election under paragraph (1) of subsection d. of this section may withdraw the digital asset in a form that permits the collection of the ancillary or subsidiary proceeds. j.     A bank shall not authorize or permit rehypothecation of digital assets under this section. The bank shall not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset except based on customer instructions. k.    A bank shall not take any action under this section which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of custodial services customary in the banking industry. l.     As used in this section: "Bank" has the meaning ascribed to it in P.L.1948, c.67 (C.17:9A-1).

STATEMENT This bill, the Virtual Currency and Blockchain Regulation Act, establishes a regulatory framework for virtual currency businesses to operate in New Jersey, creates provisions governing the use of blockchain with certain business entities, and creates certain incentives for virtual currency businesses to locate in the State. Provisions on open blockchain tokens This bill provides that certain open blockchain tokens are intangible personal property rather than securities.  An open blockchain token is to be considered intangible personal property under the bill if it meets the following characteristics: (1)  the predominant purpose of the token is consumptive; (2)  the developer or seller did not market the token to the initial buyer as a financial investment; and (3)  at least one of the following subparagraphs is satisfied: (a)  the developer or seller reasonably believed that it sold the token to the initial buyer for a consumptive purpose; (b)  the token has a consumptive purpose that is available at or near the time of sale and can be used at or near the time of sale for a consumptive purpose; (c)  the initial buyer of the token is prohibited by the developer or seller of the token from reselling the token until the token is available to be used for a consumptive purpose; or (d)  the developer or seller takes other reasonable precautions to prevent an initial buyer from purchasing the token as a financial investment. The bill requires that, before making an open blockchain token available for sale, the developer or seller of a token, or the registered agent of the developer or seller, is to electronically file a notice of intent with the Department of Banking and Insurance and pay a filing fee of $1,000.  The notice of intent is to contain the name of the person acting as a developer or seller, the contact information of the person, or the registered agent of the person and comprehensive details, to be determined by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on the open blockchain token made available for sale.  A form is to be made available by the department for this purpose, and is to include a secure electronic form conspicuously posted on the departments Internet website.  A developer, seller and the registered agent of these persons, if applicable, is to have a continuing duty to update the contact information provided on a notice of intent as long as the open blockchain token associated with the notice is actively being sold. The bill makes a willful failure by a developer, seller or facilitator to comply with the duties imposed by the bill an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act.  An unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, violations can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party. Provisions on digital assets as property This bill establishes digital assets as property and allows banks to provide custodial services for digital assets. A digital asset is a representation of an economic, proprietary, or access right that is stored in a computer readable format, and includes digital consumer assets, digital securities, and virtual currency. Under the bill, all digital assets will be classified as property, with digital consumer assets classified as a general intangible property, digital securities classified as a security, and virtual currency classified as money.  A digital asset will also be treated as a financial asset under the bill, if a written agreement is entered with the owner of the digital asset classifying the asset as such.  If the digital asset is treated as a financial asset, then the digital asset will remain as intangible personal property. Under the bill, a secured party or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party with a security interest in a digital asset will be able to perfect their security interest through control.  A secured party holding a security interest in a digital asset through control will have priority over a secured party that has a security interest in the asset but does not have control. Perfection by control will create a possessory security interest in a digital asset and will not require physical possession. Additionally, the bill will allow a bank to provide custodial services of digital assets upon providing 60 days written notice to the Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance.  A bank that elects serve as a qualified custodian must follow federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding custodial services and must ensure the following: (1)   the implementation of all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards specified by applicable State or federal laws and regulations for custodial services; (2)   maintenance of information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in custody; (3)   full compliance with applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and beneficial ownership requirements; and (4)   other actions necessary to carry out the aforementioned requirements, which may include exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities. Apart from the requirements above, a bank providing custodial services will also be required to enter into an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination that conforms to federal regulations concerning custodial services, at the cost of the bank, pursuant to certain rules and requirements. The bill also provides that digital assets held in custody are not depository liabilities or assets of the bank.  A bank, or its subsidiary, that holds digital assets in custody will be able to register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer as necessary.  Banks holding digital assets in custody must maintain control over a digital asset, with the customer electing, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody: (1)   custody under a bailment as a nonfungible or fungible asset.  Assets held under this bill will be strictly segregated from other assets; or (2)   custody under a bailment that allows the bank, based on the customers instructions, to undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank that holds a digital asset in custody under a bailment that allows the bank to undertake transactions with the digital asset will not be liable for any loss suffered with respect to any transactions made, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian. The bill provides that a bank and a customer must agree in writing with regard to the source code that the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset.  Any ambiguity within the agreement will be resolved in favor of the customer.  A bank will be required to provide clear, written notice to each customer, and require written acknowledgement, of the following: (1)   prior to the implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security vulnerabilities; (2)   the heightened risk of loss from transactions with the digital asset, if the bank is given the instruction from the customer to undertake transactions with the digital asset; (3)   that some risk of loss as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset; (4)   that custody may not result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from other customer assets if the bank is allowed to undertake transactions with the asset; and (5)   that the bank is not liable for any losses suffered if the bank does transact with the asset, with exception for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian. A bank and a customer must agree in writing to a time period within which the bank must return a digital asset held in custody.  If a customer elects to allow the bank to make transactions with the asset, then the bank and the customer may also agree in writing to the form in which the digital asset will be returned. The bill provides that all ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody will accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written agreement with the customer. The bank may elect not to collect certain ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, as long as the election is disclosed in writing. A customer who elects to custody under a bailment that treats a digital asset as either fungible or nonfungible may withdraw the digital asset in a form that permits the collection of ancillary or subsidiary proceeds. Finally, the bill provides that a bank will be prohibited from authorizing rehypothecation of digital assets.  The bank will not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset unless it has the customers instructions to do so.  A bank will also be prohibited from taking any action which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of custodial services customary in the banking industry. Provisions on decentralized autonomous organizations This bill allows the formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) under the States limited liability company law. A DAO is an organization controlled by its members with no central authority.  Instead, the organization is governed by a set of smart contracts built on distributed ledger technology or blockchain. The smart contracts automate many of the decision-making processes typically reserved for upper-tier management in a traditional company. The bill permits DAOs to incorporate as limited liability companies, and affords DAOs similar protections as are afforded to limited liability companies under current law. The bill provides a DAO is a limited liability company whose articles of organization contain a statement that the company is a decentralized autonomous organization. The bill requires DAOs to maintain a presence in the State through a registered agent and to include in its name a designation such as DAO, DAO LLC or LAO.  The bill permits limited liability companies in the State currently to convert to DAOs by amending their articles of organization. Under the bill, a DAO may be member managed or algorithmically managed, as set forth in its articles of organization. If algorithmically managed, the underlying smart contract must be able to be updated, modified or otherwise upgraded. The bill provides that the articles of organization or the smart contracts of the DAO will govern aspects or the organization such as relations among the members, rights and duties of each member, voting rights, transferability, distributions and amendments. In addition, unless provided for in the articles of organization or operating agreement, no member has any fiduciary duty to the DAO or any member other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Provisions on blockchain filing system This bill gives the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services in the New Jersey Department of the Treasury the authority to develop filing system using blockchain through which all required filings may be submitted. The division is to try to use blockchain technology and include an application programming interface as components of the filing system, as well as robust security measures and other components determined by the division to be best practices or which are likely to increase the effective and efficient administration of the laws of this State. The division may create a blockchain or contract for the use of a privately created blockchain. The division may consult with all interested parties, including businesses, registered agents, attorneys, law enforcement and other interested persons, before developing the filing system and if possible, partner with technology innovators and private companies to develop necessary components of the system. The division may also promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of the bill. Exemption for virtual currency from money transmitter law This bill also exempts virtual currency from current law governing money transmitters. Virtual currency is added to the law to mean any type of digital representation that: (1) is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value; and (2) is not recognized as legal tender by the United States government. Authorization for business entity to issue stock as certificate token This bill authorizes a business entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, to issue stock certificates in the form of electronic certificate tokens. "Certificate token" is defined as an electronic representation of a share of stock which contains certain information required under existing law for stock certificates and which is entered into a blockchain or other secure, auditable database. Business incentives for virtual currency businesses The bill also provides certain incentives for virtual currency businesses to locate in New Jersey.  The bill exempts receipts from retail sales of energy and utility service to a virtual currency servicer or registrant for use or consumption directly and primarily in the creation of virtual currency, including mining, from the tax imposed under New Jerseys "Sales and Use Tax Act."  The bill provides that a virtual currency servicer or registrant may file an application for a sales and use tax exemption with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, N.J.S.A.34:1B-242, provides certain business and insurance premiums tax credits for job creation and retention in New Jersey.  For the purposes of the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, the bill designates virtual currency servicers and registrants registered pursuant to this bills provisions to be in a targeted industry and a technology startup company. Therefore, in order for a virtual currency servicer to be eligible for that program, the minimum number of new or retained full-time jobs would be a minimum of 10 new or 25 retained full-time jobs, which is less than is required for certain other types of business.  Virtual currency servicers and registrants would also be eligible for, in addition to the base amount of the tax credit, an additional $5,000 for each new or retained full-time job each year. Allowance for virtual currency in payment of State taxes Current law, N.J.S.A.54:48-4.3, allows the Director of the Division of Taxation to establish an electronic funds transfer system for payments of State taxes.  The bill amends the definition of "electronic funds transfer" to include any transfer of virtual currency.  This change would allow the director to accept virtual currency in the payment of State taxes.

Notwithstanding the financing statement requirement specified by N.J.S.12A:9-310, perfection of a security interest in a digital asset may be achieved through control, as defined in subsection e. of this section. A security interest held by a secured party having control of a digital asset has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have control of the asset. b.    Before a secured party may take control of a digital asset under this section, the secured party shall enter into a control agreement with the debtor.  A control agreement may also set forth the terms under which a secured party may pledge its security interest in the digital asset as collateral for another transaction. c.     A secured party may file a financing statement with the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services, including to perfect a security interest in proceeds from a digital asset pursuant to N.J.S.12A:9-315. d.    Notwithstanding any law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, a transferee shall take a digital asset free of any security interest two years after the transferee takes the asset for value and does not have actual notice of an adverse claim. This subsection shall only apply to a security interest perfected by a method other than control. e.     Perfection by control creates a possessory security interest in a digital asset and does not require physical possession.  For purposes of this section, a digital asset is located within the State if the asset is held by a custodian, debtor or secured party that is physically located within the State. f.     As used in this section: "Control" means: (1)   a secured party, or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party, has the exclusive legal authority to conduct a transaction relating to a digital asset, including by means of a private key or the use of a multi signature arrangement authorized by the secured party; or (2)   a smart contract created by a secured party which has the exclusive legal authority to conduct a transaction relating to a digital asset. "Multi signature arrangement" means a system of access control relating to a digital asset for the purposes of preventing unauthorized transactions relating to the asset, in which two or more private keys are required to conduct a transaction, or any substantially similar analogue. "Private key" means a unique element of cryptographic data, or any substantially similar analogue, which is: (1)   held by a person; (2)   paired with a unique, publicly available element of cryptographic data; and (3)   associated with an algorithm that is necessary to carry out an encryption or decryption required to execute a transaction. Smart Contract means: (1)   an automated transaction conducted or performed, in whole or in part, by electronic means or electronic records, in which the acts or records of one or both parties are not reviewed by an individual in the ordinary course in forming a contract, performing under an existing contract or fulfilling an obligation required by the transaction; or (2)   any substantially similar analogue, which is comprised of code, script or programming language that executes the terms of an agreement, and which may include taking custody of and transferring an asset, or issuing executable instructions for these actions, based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of specified conditions. 6.    (New section)  a.  A bank may provide custodial services consistent with this section upon providing 60 days written notice to the Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance.  The provisions of this section are cumulative and not exclusive as an optional framework for enhanced supervision of digital asset custody.  If a bank elects to provide custodial services under this section, it shall comply with all provisions of this section. b.    A bank may serve as a qualified custodian under federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules established pursuant to 17 C.F.R. s.275.206(4).  In performing custodial services under this section, a bank shall: (1)   implement all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards specified by applicable state or federal law and regulations for custodial services; (2)   maintain information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in custody. The commissioner may specify required best practices by rule; (3)   fully comply with applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and beneficial ownership requirements; and (4)   take other actions necessary to carry out this section, which may include exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities. c.     A bank providing custodial services shall enter into an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination conforming to the requirements of 17 C.F.R. s.275.206(4) 2(a)(4) and (6), at the cost of the bank.  The accountant shall transmit the results of the examination to the commissioner within 120 days of the examination and may file the results with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission as its rules may provide.  Material discrepancies in an examination shall be reported to the commissioner within one business day.  The commissioner shall review examination results upon receipt within a reasonable time and during any regular examination conducted pursuant to P.L.1948, c.67 (C.17:9A-260). d.    Digital assets held in custody pursuant to this section shall not be depository liabilities or assets of the bank. A bank, or a subsidiary, may register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer as necessary. A bank shall maintain control over a digital asset while in custody. A customer shall elect, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody: (1)   Custody under a bailment as a nonfungible or fungible asset. Assets held under this paragraph shall be strictly segregated from other assets; or (2)   Custody under a bailment pursuant to subsection e. of this section. e.     If a customer makes an election under subsection d. of this section, the bank may, based only on customer instructions, undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank maintains control pursuant to subsection d. of this section by entering into an agreement with the counterparty to a transaction which contains a time for return of the asset. The bank shall not be liable for any loss suffered with respect to a transaction under this subsection, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian under this section. f.     A bank and a customer shall agree in writing regarding the source code version the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset under chapter 8 of Title 12A of the New Jersey Statutes. Any ambiguity under this subsection shall be resolved in favor of the customer. g.    A bank shall provide clear, written notice to each customer, and require written acknowledgement, of the following: (1)   prior to the implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security vulnerabilities; (2)   the heightened risk of loss from transactions under subsection e. of this section; (3)   that some risk of loss as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset or custody under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section; (4)   that custody under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section may not result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from other customer assets; and (5)   that the bank is not liable for losses suffered under subsection e. of this section, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian under this section. h.    A bank and a customer shall agree in writing to a time period within which the bank shall return a digital asset held in custody under this section. If a customer makes an election under paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section, then the bank and the customer may also agree in writing to the form in which the digital asset shall be returned. i.     All ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody under this section shall accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written agreement with the customer. The bank shall not collect ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, unless the collection is disclosed in writing. A customer who makes an election under paragraph (1) of subsection d. of this section may withdraw the digital asset in a form that permits the collection of the ancillary or subsidiary proceeds. j.     A bank shall not authorize or permit rehypothecation of digital assets under this section. The bank shall not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset except based on customer instructions. k.    A bank shall not take any action under this section which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of custodial services customary in the banking industry. l.     As used in this section: "Bank" has the meaning ascribed to it in P.L.1948, c.67 (C.17:9A-1).

(cf: P.L2017, c.221, s.2) 28.  Section 1 of P.L.1996, c.2 (C.54:48-4.2) is amended to read as follows: 1.    As used in [this act] P.L.1996, c.2 (C.54:48-4.2 et al.): "Cardholder" means the person or organization named on the face of a credit card or debit card to whom or for whose benefit the credit card or debit card is issued by an issuer. "Card payment system" means a technical procedure by which tax obligations owed the State may be paid by credit card or debit card. "Credit card" means any instrument or device linked to an established line of credit, whether known as a credit card, charge card, credit plate, or by any other name, issued with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in satisfying outstanding financial obligations, obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value on credit. "Debit card" means any instrument or device, whether known as a debit card, automated teller machine card, or by any other name, issued with or without fee by an issuer for the use of the cardholder in obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value through the electronic authorization of a financial institution to debit the cardholder's account. "Electronic funds transfer" means any transfer of funds or virtual currency, other than a transaction originated by check, draft, or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, or computer or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit an account. "Electronic funds transfer system" means a technical procedure by which tax obligations owed the State may be paid by an electronic transaction between the financial institution of the person or organization owing the obligation and the financial institution of the State. "Issuer" means the business organization or financial institution that issues a credit card or debit card, or its duly authorized agent. "Service charge" means a mandatory fee to be charged by the Division of Taxation in excess of the total obligation under [this act] P.L.1996, c.2 (C.54:48-4.2 et al.) owed by a person or organization to offset processing charges or discount fees for the use of a card payment system or an electronic funds transfer system. "Virtual currency" means a digital asset that is: (1)   used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value; and (2)   not recognized as legal tender by the United States government. (cf: P.L.1996, c.2, s.1) 29.  The Commissioner of Banking and Insurance shall adopt, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations the commissioner deems to be necessary, to effectuate the purposes of this act. 30.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the fourth month after enactment, except the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill, the Virtual Currency and Blockchain Regulation Act, establishes a regulatory framework for virtual currency businesses to operate in New Jersey, creates provisions governing the use of blockchain with certain business entities, and creates certain incentives for virtual currency businesses to locate in the State. Provisions on open blockchain tokens This bill provides that certain open blockchain tokens are intangible personal property rather than securities.  An open blockchain token is to be considered intangible personal property under the bill if it meets the following characteristics: (1)  the predominant purpose of the token is consumptive; (2)  the developer or seller did not market the token to the initial buyer as a financial investment; and (3)  at least one of the following subparagraphs is satisfied: (a)  the developer or seller reasonably believed that it sold the token to the initial buyer for a consumptive purpose; (b)  the token has a consumptive purpose that is available at or near the time of sale and can be used at or near the time of sale for a consumptive purpose; (c)  the initial buyer of the token is prohibited by the developer or seller of the token from reselling the token until the token is available to be used for a consumptive purpose; or (d)  the developer or seller takes other reasonable precautions to prevent an initial buyer from purchasing the token as a financial investment. The bill requires that, before making an open blockchain token available for sale, the developer or seller of a token, or the registered agent of the developer or seller, is to electronically file a notice of intent with the Department of Banking and Insurance and pay a filing fee of $1,000.  The notice of intent is to contain the name of the person acting as a developer or seller, the contact information of the person, or the registered agent of the person and comprehensive details, to be determined by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on the open blockchain token made available for sale.  A form is to be made available by the department for this purpose, and is to include a secure electronic form conspicuously posted on the departments Internet website.  A developer, seller and the registered agent of these persons, if applicable, is to have a continuing duty to update the contact information provided on a notice of intent as long as the open blockchain token associated with the notice is actively being sold. The bill makes a willful failure by a developer, seller or facilitator to comply with the duties imposed by the bill an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act.  An unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act is punishable by a monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any subsequent offense. In addition, violations can result in cease and desist orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages and the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party. Provisions on digital assets as property This bill establishes digital assets as property and allows banks to provide custodial services for digital assets. A digital asset is a representation of an economic, proprietary, or access right that is stored in a computer readable format, and includes digital consumer assets, digital securities, and virtual currency. Under the bill, all digital assets will be classified as property, with digital consumer assets classified as a general intangible property, digital securities classified as a security, and virtual currency classified as money.  A digital asset will also be treated as a financial asset under the bill, if a written agreement is entered with the owner of the digital asset classifying the asset as such.  If the digital asset is treated as a financial asset, then the digital asset will remain as intangible personal property. Under the bill, a secured party or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party with a security interest in a digital asset will be able to perfect their security interest through control.  A secured party holding a security interest in a digital asset through control will have priority over a secured party that has a security interest in the asset but does not have control. Perfection by control will create a possessory security interest in a digital asset and will not require physical possession. Additionally, the bill will allow a bank to provide custodial services of digital assets upon providing 60 days written notice to the Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance.  A bank that elects serve as a qualified custodian must follow federal Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding custodial services and must ensure the following: (1)   the implementation of all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards specified by applicable State or federal laws and regulations for custodial services; (2)   maintenance of information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in custody; (3)   full compliance with applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and beneficial ownership requirements; and (4)   other actions necessary to carry out the aforementioned requirements, which may include exercising fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities. Apart from the requirements above, a bank providing custodial services will also be required to enter into an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination that conforms to federal regulations concerning custodial services, at the cost of the bank, pursuant to certain rules and requirements. The bill also provides that digital assets held in custody are not depository liabilities or assets of the bank.  A bank, or its subsidiary, that holds digital assets in custody will be able to register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer as necessary.  Banks holding digital assets in custody must maintain control over a digital asset, with the customer electing, pursuant to a written agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital asset held in custody: (1)   custody under a bailment as a nonfungible or fungible asset.  Assets held under this bill will be strictly segregated from other assets; or (2)   custody under a bailment that allows the bank, based on the customers instructions, to undertake transactions with the digital asset. A bank that holds a digital asset in custody under a bailment that allows the bank to undertake transactions with the digital asset will not be liable for any loss suffered with respect to any transactions made, except for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian. The bill provides that a bank and a customer must agree in writing with regard to the source code that the bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset.  Any ambiguity within the agreement will be resolved in favor of the customer.  A bank will be required to provide clear, written notice to each customer, and require written acknowledgement, of the following: (1)   prior to the implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security vulnerabilities; (2)   the heightened risk of loss from transactions with the digital asset, if the bank is given the instruction from the customer to undertake transactions with the digital asset; (3)   that some risk of loss as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset; (4)   that custody may not result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from other customer assets if the bank is allowed to undertake transactions with the asset; and (5)   that the bank is not liable for any losses suffered if the bank does transact with the asset, with exception for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian. A bank and a customer must agree in writing to a time period within which the bank must return a digital asset held in custody.  If a customer elects to allow the bank to make transactions with the asset, then the bank and the customer may also agree in writing to the form in which the digital asset will be returned. The bill provides that all ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody will accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written agreement with the customer. The bank may elect not to collect certain ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, as long as the election is disclosed in writing. A customer who elects to custody under a bailment that treats a digital asset as either fungible or nonfungible may withdraw the digital asset in a form that permits the collection of ancillary or subsidiary proceeds. Finally, the bill provides that a bank will be prohibited from authorizing rehypothecation of digital assets.  The bank will not engage in any activity to use or exercise discretionary authority relating to a digital asset unless it has the customers instructions to do so.  A bank will also be prohibited from taking any action which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of custodial services customary in the banking industry. Provisions on decentralized autonomous organizations This bill allows the formation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) under the States limited liability company law. A DAO is an organization controlled by its members with no central authority.  Instead, the organization is governed by a set of smart contracts built on distributed ledger technology or blockchain. The smart contracts automate many of the decision-making processes typically reserved for upper-tier management in a traditional company. The bill permits DAOs to incorporate as limited liability companies, and affords DAOs similar protections as are afforded to limited liability companies under current law. The bill provides a DAO is a limited liability company whose articles of organization contain a statement that the company is a decentralized autonomous organization. The bill requires DAOs to maintain a presence in the State through a registered agent and to include in its name a designation such as DAO, DAO LLC or LAO.  The bill permits limited liability companies in the State currently to convert to DAOs by amending their articles of organization. Under the bill, a DAO may be member managed or algorithmically managed, as set forth in its articles of organization. If algorithmically managed, the underlying smart contract must be able to be updated, modified or otherwise upgraded. The bill provides that the articles of organization or the smart contracts of the DAO will govern aspects or the organization such as relations among the members, rights and duties of each member, voting rights, transferability, distributions and amendments. In addition, unless provided for in the articles of organization or operating agreement, no member has any fiduciary duty to the DAO or any member other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Provisions on blockchain filing system This bill gives the Division of Revenue and Enterprise Services in the New Jersey Department of the Treasury the authority to develop filing system using blockchain through which all required filings may be submitted. The division is to try to use blockchain technology and include an application programming interface as components of the filing system, as well as robust security measures and other components determined by the division to be best practices or which are likely to increase the effective and efficient administration of the laws of this State. The division may create a blockchain or contract for the use of a privately created blockchain. The division may consult with all interested parties, including businesses, registered agents, attorneys, law enforcement and other interested persons, before developing the filing system and if possible, partner with technology innovators and private companies to develop necessary components of the system. The division may also promulgate rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of the bill. Exemption for virtual currency from money transmitter law This bill also exempts virtual currency from current law governing money transmitters. Virtual currency is added to the law to mean any type of digital representation that: (1) is used as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value; and (2) is not recognized as legal tender by the United States government. Authorization for business entity to issue stock as certificate token This bill authorizes a business entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, to issue stock certificates in the form of electronic certificate tokens. "Certificate token" is defined as an electronic representation of a share of stock which contains certain information required under existing law for stock certificates and which is entered into a blockchain or other secure, auditable database. Business incentives for virtual currency businesses The bill also provides certain incentives for virtual currency businesses to locate in New Jersey.  The bill exempts receipts from retail sales of energy and utility service to a virtual currency servicer or registrant for use or consumption directly and primarily in the creation of virtual currency, including mining, from the tax imposed under New Jerseys "Sales and Use Tax Act."  The bill provides that a virtual currency servicer or registrant may file an application for a sales and use tax exemption with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury. The Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, N.J.S.A.34:1B-242, provides certain business and insurance premiums tax credits for job creation and retention in New Jersey.  For the purposes of the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, the bill designates virtual currency servicers and registrants registered pursuant to this bills provisions to be in a targeted industry and a technology startup company. Therefore, in order for a virtual currency servicer to be eligible for that program, the minimum number of new or retained full-time jobs would be a minimum of 10 new or 25 retained full-time jobs, which is less than is required for certain other types of business.  Virtual currency servicers and registrants would also be eligible for, in addition to the base amount of the tax credit, an additional $5,000 for each new or retained full-time job each year. Allowance for virtual currency in payment of State taxes Current law, N.J.S.A.54:48-4.3, allows the Director of the Division of Taxation to establish an electronic funds transfer system for payments of State taxes.  The bill amends the definition of "electronic funds transfer" to include any transfer of virtual currency.  This change would allow the director to accept virtual currency in the payment of State taxes.
