control.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e.     Perfection by control

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill provides that
certain open blockchain tokens are intangible personal property rather than
securities.  An open blockchain token is to be considered intangible personal
property under the bill if it meets the following characteristics:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  the predominant purpose
of the token is consumptive;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)  the developer or seller
did not market the token to the initial buyer as a financial investment; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)  at least one of the
following subparagraphs is satisfied:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (a)  the developer or seller
reasonably believed that it sold the token to the initial buyer for a
consumptive purpose;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)  the token has a
consumptive purpose that is available at or near the time of sale and can be
used at or near the time of sale for a consumptive purpose;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (c)  the initial buyer of the
token is prohibited by the developer or seller of the token from reselling the
token until the token is available to be used for a consumptive purpose; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (d)  the developer or seller
takes other reasonable precautions to prevent an initial buyer from purchasing
the token as a financial investment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires that, before
making an open blockchain token available for sale, the developer or seller of
a token, or the registered agent of the developer or seller, is to electronically
file a notice of intent with the Department of Banking and Insurance and pay a
filing fee of $1,000.  The notice of intent is to contain the name of the
person acting as a developer or seller, the contact information of the person,
or the registered agent of the person and comprehensive details, to be
determined by the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, on the open blockchain
token made available for sale.  A form is to be made available by the
department for this purpose, and is to include a secure electronic form
conspicuously posted on the departments Internet website.  A developer, seller
and the registered agent of these persons, if applicable, is to have a
continuing duty to update the contact information provided on a notice of
intent as long as the open blockchain token associated with the notice is
actively being sold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill makes a willful
failure by a developer, seller or facilitator to comply with the duties imposed
by the bill an unlawful practice under the Consumer Fraud Act.  An unlawful
practice under the Consumer Fraud Act is punishable by a monetary penalty of
not more than $10,000 for a first offense and not more than $20,000 for any
subsequent offense. In addition, violations can result in cease and desist
orders issued by the Attorney General, the assessment of punitive damages and
the awarding of treble damages and costs to the injured party.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Provisions on digital assets as
property</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill establishes digital
assets as property and allows banks to provide custodial services for digital
assets.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A digital asset is a
representation of an economic, proprietary, or access right that is stored in a
computer readable format, and includes digital consumer assets, digital
securities, and virtual currency. Under the bill, all digital assets will be
classified as property, with digital consumer assets classified as a general
intangible property, digital securities classified as a security, and virtual
currency classified as money.  A digital asset will also be treated as a financial
asset under the bill, if a written agreement is entered with the owner of the
digital asset classifying the asset as such.  If the digital asset is treated
as a financial asset, then the digital asset will remain as intangible personal
property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a secured
party or an agent, custodian, fiduciary or trustee of the party with a security
interest in a digital asset will be able to perfect their security interest
through control.  A secured party holding a security interest in a digital asset
through control will have priority over a secured party that has a security
interest in the asset but does not have control. Perfection by control will
create a possessory security interest in a digital asset and will not require
physical possession.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Additionally, the bill will
allow a bank to provide custodial services of digital assets upon providing 60
days written notice to the Commissioner of the Department of Banking and
Insurance.  A bank that elects serve as a qualified custodian must follow federal
Securities and Exchange Commission rules regarding custodial services and must
ensure the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   the implementation of
all accounting, account statement, internal control, notice and other standards
specified by applicable State or federal laws and regulations for custodial
services;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   maintenance of
information technology best practices relating to digital assets held in
custody;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   full compliance with
applicable federal anti-money laundering, customer identification and
beneficial ownership requirements; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   other actions necessary
to carry out the aforementioned requirements, which may include exercising
fiduciary powers similar to those permitted to national banks and ensuring
compliance with federal law governing digital assets classified as commodities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Apart from the requirements
above, a bank providing custodial services will also be required to enter into
an agreement with an independent public accountant to conduct an examination
that conforms to federal regulations concerning custodial services, at the cost
of the bank, pursuant to certain rules and requirements.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides that
digital assets held in custody are not depository liabilities or assets of the
bank.  A bank, or its subsidiary, that holds digital assets in custody will be
able to register as an investment adviser, investment company or broker dealer
as necessary.  Banks holding digital assets in custody must maintain control
over a digital asset, with the customer electing, pursuant to a written
agreement with the bank, one of the following relationships for each digital
asset held in custody:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   custody under a bailment
as a nonfungible or fungible asset.  Assets held under this bill will be
strictly segregated from other assets; or </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   custody under a bailment
that allows the bank, based on the customers instructions, to undertake
transactions with the digital asset.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A bank that holds a digital
asset in custody under a bailment that allows the bank to undertake
transactions with the digital asset will not be liable for any loss suffered
with respect to any transactions made, except for liability consistent with
fiduciary and trust powers as a custodian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that a bank
and a customer must agree in writing with regard to the source code that the
bank will use for each digital asset, and the treatment of each asset.  Any
ambiguity within the agreement will be resolved in favor of the customer.  A
bank will be required to provide clear, written notice to each customer, and
require written acknowledgement, of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   prior to the
implementation of any updates, material source code updates relating to digital
assets held in custody, except in emergencies which may include security
vulnerabilities;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   the heightened risk of
loss from transactions with the digital asset, if the bank is given the
instruction from the customer to undertake transactions with the digital asset;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   that some risk of loss
as a pro rata creditor exists as the result of custody as a fungible asset; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   that custody may not
result in the digital assets of the customer being strictly segregated from
other customer assets if the bank is allowed to undertake transactions with the
asset; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   that the bank is not
liable for any losses suffered if the bank does transact with the asset, with
exception for liability consistent with fiduciary and trust powers as a
custodian.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A bank and a customer must
agree in writing to a time period within which the bank must return a digital
asset held in custody.  If a customer elects to allow the bank to make
transactions with the asset, then the bank and the customer may also agree in
writing to the form in which the digital asset will be returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that all
ancillary or subsidiary proceeds relating to digital assets held in custody
will accrue to the benefit of the customer, except as specified by a written
agreement with the customer. The bank may elect not to collect certain
ancillary or subsidiary proceeds, as long as the election is disclosed in
writing. A customer who elects to custody under a bailment that treats a
digital asset as either fungible or nonfungible may withdraw the digital asset
in a form that permits the collection of ancillary or subsidiary proceeds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Finally, the bill provides
that a bank will be prohibited from authorizing rehypothecation of digital
assets.  The bank will not engage in any activity to use or exercise
discretionary authority relating to a digital asset unless it has the
customers instructions to do so.  A bank will also be prohibited from taking
any action which would likely impair the solvency or the safety and soundness
of the bank, as determined by the commissioner after considering the nature of
custodial services customary in the banking industry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Provisions on decentralized autonomous
organizations</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill allows the formation
of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) under the States limited
liability company law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A DAO is an organization
controlled by its members with no central authority.  Instead, the organization
is governed by a set of smart contracts built on distributed ledger technology
or blockchain. The smart contracts automate many of the decision-making
processes typically reserved for upper-tier management in a traditional
company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill permits DAOs to
incorporate as limited liability companies, and affords DAOs similar
protections as are afforded to limited liability companies under current law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides a DAO is a
limited liability company whose articles of organization contain a statement that
the company is a decentralized autonomous organization. The bill requires DAOs
to maintain a presence in the State through a registered agent and to include
in its name a designation such as DAO, DAO LLC or LAO.  The bill permits
limited liability companies in the State currently to convert to DAOs by
amending their articles of organization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Under the bill, a DAO may be
member managed or algorithmically managed, as set forth in its articles of
organization. If algorithmically managed, the underlying smart contract must be
able to be updated, modified or otherwise upgraded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that the
articles of organization or the smart contracts of the DAO will govern aspects
or the organization such as relations among the members, rights and duties of
each member, voting rights, transferability, distributions and amendments. In
addition, unless provided for in the articles of organization or operating
agreement, no member has any fiduciary duty to the DAO or any member other than
the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Provisions on blockchain filing
system</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill gives the Division
of Revenue and Enterprise Services in the New Jersey Department of the Treasury
the authority to develop filing system using blockchain through which all
required filings may be submitted. The division is to try to use blockchain
technology and include an application programming interface as components of
the filing system, as well as robust security measures and other components
determined by the division to be best practices or which are likely to increase
the effective and efficient administration of the laws of this State. The
division may create a blockchain or contract for the use of a privately created
blockchain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The division may consult with
all interested parties, including businesses, registered agents, attorneys, law
enforcement and other interested persons, before developing the filing system
and if possible, partner with technology innovators and private companies to
develop necessary components of the system. The division may also promulgate
rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of the bill. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Exemption for virtual currency
from money transmitter law</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill also exempts virtual
currency from current law governing money transmitters. Virtual currency is
added to the law to mean any type of digital representation that: (1) is used
as a medium of exchange, unit of account or store of value; and (2) is not
recognized as legal tender by the United States government. <br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Authorization for business
entity to issue stock as certificate token</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill authorizes a
business entity, such as a corporation or limited liability company, to issue
stock certificates in the form of electronic certificate tokens.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     &quot;Certificate token&quot;
is defined as an electronic representation of a share of stock which contains
certain information required under existing law for stock certificates and
which is entered into a blockchain or other secure, auditable database.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Business incentives for virtual
currency businesses</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also provides certain
incentives for virtual currency businesses to locate in New Jersey.  The bill
exempts receipts from retail sales of energy and utility service to a virtual
currency servicer or registrant for use or consumption directly and primarily
in the creation of virtual currency, including mining, from the tax imposed
under New Jerseys &quot;Sales and Use Tax Act.&quot;  The bill provides that a
virtual currency servicer or registrant may file an application for a sales and
use tax exemption with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the
Department of the Treasury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The Grow New Jersey
Assistance Act, N.J.S.A.34:1B-242, provides certain business and insurance
premiums tax credits for job creation and retention in New Jersey.  For the
purposes of the Grow New Jersey Assistance Act, the bill designates virtual
currency servicers and registrants registered pursuant to this bills
provisions to be in a targeted industry and a technology startup company.
Therefore, in order for a virtual currency servicer to be eligible for that
program, the minimum number of new or retained full-time jobs would be a
minimum of 10 new or 25 retained full-time jobs, which is less than is required
for certain other types of business.  Virtual currency servicers and
registrants would also be eligible for, in addition to the base amount of the
tax credit, an additional $5,000 for each new or retained full-time job each
year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><b>Allowance for virtual currency
in payment of State taxes</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Current law,
N.J.S.A.54:48-4.3, allows the Director of the Division of Taxation to establish
an electronic funds transfer system for payments of State taxes.  The bill
amends the definition of &quot;electronic funds transfer&quot; to include any
transfer of virtual currency.  This change would allow the director to accept
virtual currency in the payment of State taxes.</p>
