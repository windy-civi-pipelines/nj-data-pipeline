body, including any public body that is in but not of a particular part of the
executive branch, that is granted the authority under any State law to regulate

prior to appointment or employment, the person held any direct or indirect
interest in, or any employment by, any holder of, or applicant for, a marijuana
license, permit, certification, or other form of document which authorizes the
recipient thereof to engage in activities associated with a legalized marijuana
marketplace; provided, however, that notwithstanding any other provision of
this act to the contrary, any such person may be appointed to or employed by a
department, division, office, bureau, board, commission, public authority,
public agency, or other public body as described herein if the persons prior

department, division, office, bureau, board, commission, public authority,
public agency, or other public body, interfere with the objective discharge of
the person's duties or employment obligations, but in no instance shall any
person be appointed or employed if the persons prior interest in the holder
of, or applicant for, a marijuana license, permit, certification, or other form
of document, constituted a controlling interest in that document holder or
applicant therefor; and provided further, however, that notwithstanding any
other provision of this act to the contrary, any such person may be employed by
the commission in a secretarial or clerical position if, in the opinion of the
department, division, office, bureau, board, commission, public authority,
public agency, or other public body, the persons previous employment by, or
interest in, any holder of, or applicant for, a marijuana license, permit,

Ethics Commission a financial disclosure statement listing all assets and
