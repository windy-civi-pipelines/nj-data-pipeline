and, Whereas, In 1966, Chavez led a 340 mile march from Delano, California to Sacramento, California, to draw attention to the cause of striking farm workers, garnering thousands of supporters along the way; and Whereas, Chavez was an innovator in developing bargaining strategies for exploited workers, and he was one of the first labor leaders to use boycotts in large-scale labor-management disputes, recruiting millions of followers to boycott grapes and other products for La Causa (the cause of the farm workers); and Whereas, The boycotts led by Chavez ultimately led to the enactment of Californias Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, the first and only law in the United States guaranteeing farm workers the right to form unions;

and Whereas, Chavez is known for the motto, Sí se puede, which translates to Yes, it can be done, spoken during one of his three fasts, and Chavezs efforts to fight for the rights of farm workers became known as La Causa; and Whereas, Under Chavez, the UFW advanced employment rights for its workers, including but not limited to collective bargaining agreements with medical benefits for workers, and abolishment of a short-handled hoe that led to the crippling of many farm workers; and Whereas, In the 1960s, Chavez voluntarily gave up his position and salary of staff director with the CSO to dedicate himself to La Causa, and he embraced a life of poverty, never earning more than $6,000 a year and never owning a home; and Whereas, Although Chavez was most well-known for his advocacy for farm workers, he was never fearful to voice his beliefs, even when not shared by many of his followers, including being an early supporter of gay rights in the 1970s; and Whereas, In 1962, President Kennedy offered Chavez a leadership position within the Peace Corps, but Chavez turned down the job to carry on his work; and Whereas, Although Cesar Chavez died in 1993, his work and life continue to inspire oppressed workers and other groups of people to stand up for their rights; and Whereas, President Clinton awarded the Medal of Freedom, the nations highest civilian honor, to Chavez posthumously; and Whereas, March 31st is celebrated as Cesar Chavez Day in nine U.S. states and as a federal commemorative holiday, and Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper, and in the public interest, for the Legislature and Governor of this State to commemorate and honor the anniversary of Cesar Chavezs birth; now, therefore, Be It Resolved by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    March 31 of each year is designated as Cesar Chavez Day to commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Cesar Chavez, who dedicated his life to provide a voice to oppressed migrant farm workers and their families. 2.    The Governor shall annually issue a proclamation and call upon public officials, and all citizens of this State, to observe Cesar Chavez Day with appropriate programs and activities. 3.    This joint resolution shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This joint resolution commemorates the birth and celebrates the life of Cesar Chavez by designating March 31 of each year as Cesar Chavez Day. Cesar Chavez worked in the farm fields of California since he was a child, leaving school when his father suffered an accident so that his mother would not have to work in the fields. Chavez joined the U.S. Navy in 1946 and served for two years in the Western Pacific.  Upon completion of his service, Chavez returned to work in the farm fields. However, Chavez still had a desire to help others, and despite only having an eighth grade education, he became the staff director of the Community Service Organization (CSO) in the 1950s and early 1960s.  In this position, Chavez assisted individuals with important tasks such as voter registration.  Although this work provided Chavez with a stable salary, he voluntarily left this position to dedicate himself to La Causa, standing up for the employment rights of oppressed migrant farm workers and their families.  By doing so, Chavez took on a life of poverty, never earning more than $6,000 per year. Inspired by St. Francis, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi, Cesar Chavez employed a strategy of non-violent advocacy for the rights of farm workers.  This advocacy included labor strikes and the boycotting of grapes and other produce.  The boycotting ultimately led to the passage of Californias Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, the first and only law guaranteeing farm workers the right to unionize. Further, Chavez led a 340 mile march from Delano, California to Sacramento, California in 1966.  Additionally, Chavez engaged in fasting on three separate occasions: in 1968, Chavez fasted for 25 days; in 1972 Chavez fasted for another 25 days; and in 1988, at the age of 61, Chavez fasted for 36 days. Chavez founded the National Farm Workers Association, which is now the United Farm Workers (UFW), the union for farm workers, in 1962.  Moreover, Chavez formed the National Farm Workers Service Center in 1966, now the Cesar Chavez Foundation, which provides educational services to children, provides and manages affordable housing projects and operates the Radio Campesina network, providing Spanish language music and educational programming. Although Chavez died in 1993, his legacy endures.  In 1994, President Clinton awarded the Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor, to Chavez posthumously, and Chavezs work and life continue to inspire many others. With this designation, the Legislature and the Governor honor the life of Cesar Chavez and continue to raise awareness for La Causa.
