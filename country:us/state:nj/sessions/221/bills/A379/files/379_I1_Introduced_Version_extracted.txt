(cf: P.L.2007, c.334, s.5) 4.    R.S.19:36-3 is amended to read as follows: 19:36-3.      After choosing a president and secretary from their own body, such electors shall proceed to perform the duties required of them by the constitution and laws of the United States[, and in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this act, P.L.2007, c.334 (C.19:36-4) in any year in which, on July 20, the "Agreement Among the States to Elect the President by National Popular Vote" is in effect in states cumulatively possessing a majority of the electoral votes, and the State of New Jersey remains a member of that agreement]. (cf: P.L.2007, c.334, s.6) 5.    Section 1 of P.L.2007, c.334 (C.19:36-4) is repealed. 6.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill repeals the "Agreement Among the States to Elect the President by National Popular Vote," adopted as part of the New Jersey statutes pursuant to P.L.2007, c.334, and amends various parts of the statutory law to remove any reference to the agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, when enough states collectively possessing the majority of the electoral votes required to decide a presidential race become parties to the agreement, New Jerseys electoral votes will be required to be allocated to the presidential candidate that won the popular vote nationwide, regardless of whether that candidate won in New Jersey. This manner of allocating electoral votes is a radical departure from the current system in New Jersey which, in the winner-take-all manner, the States electoral votes are allocated to the candidate that won the popular vote in the State.  By requiring that the States electoral votes be allocated to the national popular vote winner instead of the candidate who won in New Jersey, the national popular vote agreement disenfranchises New Jersey voters and arguably amounts to the circumvention of the United States Constitution.
