<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill expands the
membership and responsibilities of the State Council on Developmental
Disabilities.  Specifically, the bill amends section 3 of P.L.1979, c.105
(C.30:1AA-3) to increase the number of State agency representatives on the
council, to eight, to include the Commissioner of Children and Families and the
Ombudsman for Individuals with Intellectual or Developmental Disabilities and
their Families.  Current law stipulates that the councils membership consist
of seven State agency representatives including, but not limited to,
representatives from the Departments of Education, Health, Human Services, and
Labor and Workforce Development.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill amends section 8 of
P.L.1979, c.105 (C.30:1AA-8) to expand the State councils responsibility to
include activities to assist the Childrens System of Care (CSOC) in the
Department of Children and Families to identify and analyze gaps in services
provided by the CSOC to children and youth, under the age of 21, with
disabilities, and how the implementation of the New Jersey Autism State Plan
Amendment could help address those gaps in services.  The council would contract
with a community-based agency to identify and analyze the gaps in services and
prepare a report with recommendations to address the gaps in services .  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The agency selected by the council
to identify and analyze the gaps in services would: have experience with, and
in-depth knowledge in, providing services to children and youth with
developmental disabilities; have an understanding of the regulations, laws,
policies, and procedures governing the CSOC; and  seek input from children and
youth with disabilities and their families, advocacy groups, community-based
service providers, behavioral health care providers, care management
organizations, mobile response services programs, family support organizations,
the Division of Child Protection and Permanency in the Department of Children
and Families, county inter-agency coordinating councils, and residential
treatment and licensed health care facilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bills provisions amend
section 8 of P.L.1979, c.105 (C.30:1AA-8) to expand the State councils
responsibility to include activities to assist the Division of Medical
Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS) in the Department of Human Services and the
CSOC in making recommendations on the implementation of the New Jersey Autism
State Plan Amendment, and to allow the council  to seek the input of advocacy
groups, community-based service providers, behavioral health care providers,
care management organizations, mobile response services programs, family
support organizations, and other agencies and organizations that provide
services to children and families in order to make recommendations on the
implementation of the State Plan Amendment</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Presently, the State council
is required to participate in activities that contribute to a coordinated,
consumer- and family-centered and consumer- and family-directed comprehensive
system which includes needed community services, individualized supports and
other forms of assistance that promote self-determination for individuals with
developmental disabilities and their families.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The law does not specify that
the councils activities include: assisting the CSOC to identify and analyze
gaps in services provided to children and youth, under the age of 21, with
disabilities and how the implementation of the New Jersey Autism State Plan
Amendment could help address those gaps; assisting the DMAHS in making
recommendations on the implementation of the New Jersey Autism State Plan
Amendment; and seeking the input of advocacy groups, community-based service
providers, behavioral health care providers, care management organizations,
mobile response services programs, family support organizations, and other
agencies and organizations that provide services to children and families in
order to make recommendations on the implementation of the State Plan Amendment
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also amends section 8
of P.L.1979, c.105 (C.30:1AA-8) to require that the annual report prepared by
the council be transmitted to the Departments of Children and Families, Health,
and Human Services, and that the report contain recommendations on how to
address the gaps in services provided by the CSOC to children and youth, under
the age of 21, with disabilities.  Current law requires that the annual report
be transmitted only to the Department of Health, and for the report to contain information
about the progress made by the council in achieving the purpose set forth in
section 1 of P.L.2003, c.54 (C.30:1AA-1.1).</p>
