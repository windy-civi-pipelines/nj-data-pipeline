CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning the administration of school meals programs, and supplementing Title 18A of the New Jersey Statutes.

nor shall the transfer affect any order or recommendation that has been made by, or any other matters or administrative proceedings that are pending before, the Department of Agriculture as of the effective date of this section. k.    The Department of Education shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), and shall be authorized to issue orders or guidance, as may be necessary to effectuate the powers and duties that have been transferred thereto pursuant to this section. 2.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment, except that the Secretary of Agriculture and Commissioner of Education shall take anticipatory administrative action, in advance thereof, as may be necessary for the implementation of this act. STATEMENT This bill would transfer authority over all school meals programs in the State from the Department of Agriculture (DOA) to the Department of Education (DOE).  A school meals program is defined to mean and include:  the National School Lunch Program; the federal School Breakfast Program, including a school breakfast after the bell program; the Summer Food Service Program or Seamless Summer Option; the Child and Adult Care Food Program; any emergency meals distribution program; and any other similar State or federal nutrition assistance program that is designed to ensure that children enrolled in school, or that children or adults attending a day care center or other, similar temporary care facility, have regular and affordable access to nutritious meals. The transfer of authority under the bill would not affect any civil or criminal actions or proceedings that have been brought by or against the DOA in association with its administration and enforcement of a school meals program, and which are pending as of the bills effective date.  Nor would the transfer affect any order or recommendation that has been made by, or any other matters or administrative proceedings that are pending before, the DOA as of the bills effective date. The existing orders, rules, and regulations of the DOA that have been issued in relation to the States school meals programs would also remain in effect until they are either repealed or superseded by rules, regulations, and orders adopted by the DOE pursuant to the bill, whichever occurs first. Although the DOA currently has authority to administer and enforce all school meals programs operating in the State, this authority is superfluous to, and takes the departments attention away from, its main purposes and functions, which are to promote and protect the States agriculture and agribusiness industries and lands, and to conserve soil and water resources for agricultural purposes.  The primary purpose and function of the DOE, by contrast, is to support schools, students, educators, and school districts in order to ensure that students are capable of achieving academic excellence.  Because access to nutritional meals is a proven means by which students enhance their capacity for academic success, and because the DOEs mission already requires it to focus on programs geared toward schools and students, the DOE is better positioned, and is the more appropriate department, to administer the school meals programs and to provide assistance to schools, students, parents, and guardians, in association with the operation of those programs.
