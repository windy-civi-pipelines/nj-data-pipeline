S1610 SENATE, No. 1610 STATE OF NEW JERSEY 221st LEGISLATURE PRE-FILED FOR INTRODUCTION IN THE 2024 SESSION Sponsored by: Senator  ANDREW ZWICKER District 16 (Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex and Somerset) Senator  RAJ MUKHERJI District 32 (Hudson) Co-Sponsored by: Senator Johnson SYNOPSIS Requires outdoor lighting fixtures installed or replaced by, or on behalf of State, or at projects receiving State funds, to meet certain criteria. CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning certain outdoor lighting fixtures and supplementing Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    As used in this act: Energy conservation means the reduction of energy costs and resources by use of methods including, but not limited to, the use of light fixtures with the lowest feasible wattage or a photo-sensitive or timer switch. Full cutoff fixture means a luminaire whose luminous intensity in candelas at or above an angle of 90 degrees above nadir does not numerically exceed 2.5 percent of the luminous flux, in lumens, of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire, and the luminous intensity, in candelas, at or above a vertical angle of 80 degrees above nadir does not numerically exceed 10 percent of the luminous flux of the lamp or lamps in the luminaire. Fully shielded luminaire means a luminaire that allows no direct light emissions above a horizontal plane through the lowest light-emitting part of the luminaire. Glare means direct light emitting from a luminaire that is significantly greater than luminance to which the eyes are adapted which causes reduced vision or momentary blindness. Illuminance means the unit measure of light at a surface. Lamp means the component of a luminaire that produces the specific form of radiant energy that is observed as light. Light trespass means light emitted by a luminaire that shines beyond the boundaries of the property on which the luminaire is located. Lumen means an international standard unit of luminous flux representing the quantity of visible light output. Luminaire means the complete lighting unit fixture consisting of a lamp, or lamps and ballasts, together with the parts designed to distribute light, including, but not limited to, a reflector, lens, and diffuser, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply. Luminous flux means the measure of the perceived power of the light in lumens. Outdoor lighting fixture means any type of fixed or movable lighting equipment that is designed or used for illumination outdoors. Outdoor lighting fixture shall not include lighting equipment that is required by law to be installed on motor vehicles, or lighting required for the safe operation of aircraft or installed at an aviation facility. Project means the acquisition, construction, improvement, reconstruction, or repair of all or part of any building, facility, structure, or real property. State agency means any of the principal departments in the Executive Branch of State Government, and any division, board, bureau, office, commission, or other instrumentality created by a principal department and any independent State authority, commission, instrumentality, or agency established by law. 2.    a.  Commencing on the effective date of this act, an outdoor lighting fixture installed or replaced by, or on behalf of, a State agency, or as part of a project that receives funds from a State agency, shall comply with the following specifications: (1)   the luminaire shall be a fully shielded luminaire; (2)   the outdoor lighting fixture shall emit only as much light as necessary for the intended purpose and shall not exceed the minimum illuminance level recommended for that purpose by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America or the Federal Highway Administration; (3)   the outdoor lighting fixture shall use a full cutoff fixture when the output of light is greater than 1,800 lumens; and (4)   full consideration has been given to energy conservation, and reducing glare, minimizing light trespass and light pollution, and preserving the natural night environment. b.  The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply in the following circumstances: (1)   the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis because emergency personnel require additional illumination for emergency procedures; (2)   the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis for nighttime work; or (3)   a compelling safety interest exists that cannot be addressed by another method. c.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section to the contrary, in the case of outdoor lighting fixtures installed along any roadway in the State, the Department of Transportation shall assess whether the purpose of the outdoor lighting fixture can be achieved by the installation of reflective road markers, lines, warning or informational signs, or other effective passive methods in lieu of the installation of outdoor lighting fixtures. d.  The State Treasurer shall provide guidance to every State agency concerning the requirements of this act. 3.    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, or rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Purchase and Property in the Department of the Treasury, the Director of the Division of Property Management and Construction in the Department of the Treasury, or any State agency having authority to contract for the purchase of goods or services, shall comply with the requirements of this act. 4.    This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following the date of enactment. STATEMENT This bill would require outdoor lighting fixtures installed or replaced by, or on behalf of, a State agency, or at projects receiving public moneys from a State agency, to meet certain criteria in order to reduce light pollution. The bill would require outdoor lighting fixtures installed or replaced by, or on behalf of, a State agency, or as part of a project that receives funds from a State agency, to comply with the following:  (1) the luminaire is a fully shielded luminaire; (2) the outdoor lighting fixture emits only as much light as necessary for the intended purpose and shall not exceed the minimum illuminance level recommended for that purpose by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America or the Federal Highway Administration; (3) the outdoor lighting fixture uses a full cutoff fixture when the output of light is greater than 1,800 lumens; and (4) full consideration has been given to energy conservation, reducing glare, minimizing light trespass and light pollution, and preserving the natural night environment. The bill would not apply if the: the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis because emergency personnel require additional illumination for emergency procedures; the outdoor lighting fixture is used on a temporary basis for nighttime work; or a compelling safety interest exists that cannot be addressed by another method. In addition, in the case of outdoor lighting fixtures installed along roadways, the bill requires the Department of Transportation to assess whether the purpose of the outdoor lighting fixture can be achieved by the installation of reflective road markers, lines, warning or informational signs, or other effective passive methods in lieu of the installation of outdoor lighting fixtures. The provisions of the bill would take effect on the first day of the third month after the bill is enacted into law. At least 18 other states have enacted laws intended to reduce light pollution in order to promote energy conservation, public safety, aesthetic interests, and astronomical research capabilities.  Taking actions to address light pollution will reduce energy usage and energy costs, while also helping to protect and preserve New Jersey's natural nighttime environment.  Unshielded outdoor lights are responsible for emitting pollutants and wasted light, and over-lighting during non-daylight hours neither improves visibility nor increases nighttime safety.  This bill would help to remove unnecessary lighting and utilize efficient light sources in order to save money and improve the natural nighttime environment.
