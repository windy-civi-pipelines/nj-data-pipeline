STATEMENT This bill amends the Earn Your Way Out Act, P.L.2019, c.364, by adding to the list of crimes ineligible for administrative parole.  Under the Earn Your Way Out Act, a person serving a term of imprisonment for an eligible crime may be automatically released on parole at the first opportunity for parole release if the person satisfies certain criteria, such as completing rehabilitative programs and having no serious disciplinary infractions.  Under current law, the crimes ineligible for administrative parole are those subject to the No Early Release Act, Megans Law, the Graves Act, and the Sexually Violent Predator Act. Under the bill, the following additional crimes would be ineligible for administrative parole: human trafficking, sexual extortion, aggravated arson, endangering the welfare of a child by abusing or neglecting the child, child pornography, leader of a drug trafficking network, maintaining or operating a narcotics production facility, manufacturing or distributing or selling narcotics in the first degree, soliciting or supporting terrorism, leader of a firearms trafficking network, animal cruelty, and any other crime of the first degree not already included. A crime of the first degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of between 10 to 20 years, a fine of up to $200,000, or both.
