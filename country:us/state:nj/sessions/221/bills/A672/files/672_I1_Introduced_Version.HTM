(cf: P.L.2007, c.251, s.5) 13.  This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT Entitled the Mold-Safe Housing Act, this bill would create mechanisms for tenants living in mold-contaminated rental housing to have the mold effectively removed, or be relocated to safer rental housing.  In addition, the bill provides a system of inspection of all rental housing for the presence of mold.  Single family and two-family rental housing will be required to be inspected upon a change in occupancy, as well as every five years as part of the multiple dwelling inspection.  Multiple dwellings will be inspected every five years for mold under the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, which is enforced currently by the Bureau of Housing Inspection in the Department of Community Affairs. The bill provides that a prospective home purchaser can specify that an inspection for presence of mold be performed by a licensed home inspector, should they retain such an inspector prior to purchase. The bill permits tenants whose landlords fail to abate a mold hazard, upon written request to do so, to notify the Department of Community Affairs, who shall investigate each claim and determine whether to relocate the tenant.  Current relocation assistance laws would apply in such circumstances.  In addition, the bill requires the court to notify the department whenever a tenant is constructively evicted due to mold or some other issue of habitability in the rental property.

STATEMENT Entitled the Mold-Safe Housing Act, this bill would create mechanisms for tenants living in mold-contaminated rental housing to have the mold effectively removed, or be relocated to safer rental housing.  In addition, the bill provides a system of inspection of all rental housing for the presence of mold.  Single family and two-family rental housing will be required to be inspected upon a change in occupancy, as well as every five years as part of the multiple dwelling inspection.  Multiple dwellings will be inspected every five years for mold under the Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law, which is enforced currently by the Bureau of Housing Inspection in the Department of Community Affairs. The bill provides that a prospective home purchaser can specify that an inspection for presence of mold be performed by a licensed home inspector, should they retain such an inspector prior to purchase. The bill permits tenants whose landlords fail to abate a mold hazard, upon written request to do so, to notify the Department of Community Affairs, who shall investigate each claim and determine whether to relocate the tenant.  Current relocation assistance laws would apply in such circumstances.  In addition, the bill requires the court to notify the department whenever a tenant is constructively evicted due to mold or some other issue of habitability in the rental property.
