(cf: P.L.2013, c.253, s.53) 2.  Section 13 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  (a)  Each multiple dwelling and each hotel shall be inspected  for the purpose of determining the extent to which each hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder.  The commissioner shall establish by regulation the frequency of inspections, which shall be conducted as follows: (1)   each hotel shall be inspected at least once every five years; and (2)   each multiple dwelling shall be categorized into the following tiers based upon the number of reinspections required to abate the violations that were served upon the owner following an initial inspection: (i)    a multiple dwelling in which no violations are found or all violations have been abated by the first reinspection shall be placed in the highest tier and shall next be inspected in seven years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (ii)   a multiple dwelling in which all violations have been abated by the second or third reinspection shall be placed in the middle tier and shall next be inspected in five years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (iii)  a multiple dwelling in which all violations have not been abated by the third reinspection shall be placed in the lowest tier and shall next be inspected in two years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time. (3)   notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section to the contrary, if the commissioner determines that tiered inspection schedules do not adequately protect the health and safety of residents of multiple dwellings, the commissioner may, by regulation, require that cyclical inspections for multiple dwellings occur once every five years. (b)   Within 30 days of the most recent inspection, the owner of each hotel shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows: $15 per unit of dwelling space for the first 20 units of dwelling space in any building or project, $12 per unit of dwelling space for the 21st through 100th unit in any building or project, $8 per unit of dwelling space for the 101st through 250th unit in any building or project, and $5 per unit of dwelling space for all units over 250 in any building or project, except that in the case of hotels open and operating less than six months in each year the fee shall be one-half that which would otherwise be required, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for hotels in the amount of $10 for each dwelling unit reinspected or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Within 30 days of the most recent inspection of any multiple dwelling occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more persons living independently of each other, the owner of each such multiple dwelling shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee of $33 per unit of dwelling space for the first 7 units in any building or project, $21 per unit of dwelling space for the 8th through the 24th unit in any building or project, $18 per unit for the 25th through the 48th unit in any building or project, and $12 per unit of dwelling space for all units of dwelling space over 48 in any building or project, provided that the maximum total fee for owner-occupied three-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $65 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, and the maximum total fee for owner-occupied four-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $80 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.  A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for multiple dwellings in the amount of $40 for each dwelling unit reinspected, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, but only after the first reinspection. The commissioner may waive the inspection fee for any unit upon a finding that the unit has been thoroughly inspected within the previous 12-month period under a municipal ordinance requiring inspection upon change of occupancy in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and has received a municipal certificate of occupancy as a result of that inspection. If the commissioner finds that (1) a building has been thoroughly inspected prior to resale since the most recent inspection in accordance with this section, (2) the inspection prior to resale was conducted by the municipality in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and (3) a municipal certificate of occupancy was issued as a result of that inspection, the commissioner may accept the inspection done prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection under this section.  If the commissioner accepts an inspection prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection, no fee shall be charged for any inspection done by the commissioner within the years remaining in the applicable inspection cycle after the date of the inspection so accepted. (c)   If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof, upon receipt of the application and fee as required by subsection (b) of this section, a certificate of inspection.  Any owner to whom a certificate of inspection is issued shall keep said certificate posted in a conspicuous location in the hotel or multiple dwelling to which the certificate applies.  The certificate of inspection shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, upon finding a consistent pattern of compliance with the maintenance standards established under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) in at least 20 percent of the units in a building or project, issue a certificate of inspection for the building or project, in which case the inspection fee shall be charged on the basis of the number of units inspected. The commissioner may by rule establish standards for self-inspection by condominium associations exercising control over buildings of not more than three stories, constructed after 1976, and certified by the local enforcing agency having jurisdiction as being in compliance with the Uniform Fire Code promulgated pursuant to P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), in which at least 80 percent of the dwelling units are occupied by the unit owners.  The commissioner shall issue a certificate of acceptance, which shall be in lieu of a certificate of inspection, upon acceptance of any such self-inspection and upon payment of a fee of $25. (d)  (1)  If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a written notice stating the manner in which any such hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder. Said notice shall fix such date, not less than 60 days nor more than 180 days, on or before which any such hotel or multiple dwelling must comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is not made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall not issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section, and shall enforce the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) against the owner thereof. (2)  In addition to complying with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the commissioner determines that a violation of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) is a potentially hazardous violation, then the commissioner shall comply with this paragraph, and shall immediately send, by certified or ordinary mail, and by electronic mail, a written notice, stating the manner in which the hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder, to: (i)  The mayor of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; (ii)  The administrator, business administrator, city manager, township manager, municipal manager, or other municipal official with executive authority not vested in the mayor of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located, as is applicable to the municipality; (iii)  All members of the governing body of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; (iv) The clerk, public information officer, or other municipal official responsible for the distribution of communications to the residents of the municipality, as applicable to the municipality; and (v)  The owner and operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling, including, if applicable, to the property owners last known address, as determined through a review of local property tax and other available records. (3)  If a notice issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection concerns a potentially hazardous violation, then, in addition to complying with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the commissioner and the owner and operator of a hotel or multiple dwelling shall comply with this paragraph, and the commissioner shall include as a part of the notice a mailing notification that shall contain large, easily readable text and be presented on distinctly colored paper or other paper that is easily distinguishable from other notices or communications otherwise sent by the commissioner.  The owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling shall provide a hard copy of said mailing notification to each existing resident or guest of the hotel or multiple dwelling.  The owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling shall additionally post a copy of the notification in a conspicuous location in the lobby or common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, in which the information is most likely to be viewed by residents or guests; and within ten feet of the elevator on each floor of the hotel or multiple dwelling, or, if the hotel or multiple dwelling does not have an elevator, within ten feet of, or in, the main stairwell of each floor.  A notification posted in a common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, pursuant to this subsection, may be removed only after the commissioner issues to the owner and operator a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section.  For a hotel room or dwelling unit impacted by a potentially hazardous violation, the owner or operator of any hotel or multiple dwelling shall not enter a new lease for non-owner occupancy, or make available for the same, such unit for such time as the hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder and the commissioner has issued to the owner and operator thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section. (e)   The commissioner shall annually review the cost of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), including the cost to municipalities of carrying out inspections pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-21), and shall establish by rule, not more frequently than once every three years, such fees as may be necessary to cover the costs of such implementation and enforcement; provided, however, that any increase or decrease shall be applied as a uniform percentage to each category of fee established herein, and provided, further, that the percentage amount of any increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in salaries paid to State employees since the then current fee schedule was established.  The commissioner shall provide by rule to owners the option of paying inspection fees in installments in the form of an annual fee. The commissioner shall annually prepare and file with the presiding officers of the Senate and General Assembly and the legislative committees having jurisdiction in housing matters a report setting forth the amounts of fees and penalties received by the Bureau of Housing Inspection, the cost to the bureau of enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and information concerning the productivity of the bureau.  Copies of the report shall also be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New Jersey Register.  If in any State fiscal year the fee revenue received by the bureau exceeds the cost of enforcement of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), the excess revenue shall be distributed pro rata to persons who paid inspection fees during that fiscal year.  Such distribution shall be made within three months after the end of the fiscal year. (f)   Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of P.L.1991, c.179 (C.55:13A-26.1), the fees established by or pursuant to the provisions of this section are dedicated to meeting the costs of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and shall not be used for any other purpose.  All receipts in excess of $2,200,000 are hereby appropriated for the purposes of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2019, c.202, s.2) 3.  Section 20 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-20) is amended to read as follows: 20.  (a)        Notices, rules, decisions, and orders required or permitted to be issued and served pursuant to P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), except as otherwise provided for a notice of noncompliance issued for a potentially hazardous violation pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (d) of section 13 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-13), shall be served as follows: (1)   On the owner: (i)    By mailing same by certified or ordinary mail to the person designated as owner or agent on the certificate of registration or in the municipal tax records or in the records of the Department of the Treasury; or (ii)   By serving same on the owner, or upon a person authorized to accept service on behalf of the owner in a civil matter, in accordance with the Rules of Court. (2)   On the occupant: (i)    By mailing same by certified or ordinary mail to said occupant; (ii)   By serving same on the Department of the Treasury, who shall be deemed the owner's agent for service of process, provided however, that reasonable efforts have first been made to serve the owner or his agent by certified mail and that a copy of such notice is posted in a conspicuous location on the premises.  "Conspicuous location" shall include the walls of the front vestibule or in any common foyer or hallway immediately inside the main front entrance; or (iii)  By leaving same at the dwelling unit of the occupant with a competent member of the household of the age of 14 or over.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.202, s.3) 4.  On or before the first day of the third month next following the enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedures Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill would enhance notice requirements and occupancy restrictions for hotels and multiple dwellings following a determination of a potentially hazardous condition through an inspection conducted pursuant to the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) (HMDL).  As used in the bill, potentially hazardous conditions would consist of imminent hazards to health, safety or welfare, or a deteriorating structural, sanitary, or other condition that, if unaddressed, may result in an imminent hazard prior to the next scheduled inspection conducted pursuant to the HMDL. The bill provides that, if the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) determines that a violation of the HMDL is a potentially hazardous violation, then the commissioner would be required to immediately send, by certified or ordinary mail, and by electronic mail, a written notice, stating the manner in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is out of compliance, to: · The mayor of the municipality; · The administrator, business administrator, city manager, township manager, municipal manager, or other municipal official with executive authority not vested in the mayor of the municipality; · All members of the governing body of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; · The clerk, public information officer, or other municipal official responsible for the distribution of communications to the residents of the municipality; and · The owner and operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling, including, if applicable, to the property owners last known address. Concerning a potentially hazardous violation, the bill requires the commissioner to include the notice in a mailing with large, easily readable text, presented on paper that is easily distinguishable from other notices or communications.  The bill requires the owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling to provide a hard copy of the notice to each existing resident or guest of the hotel or multiple dwelling.  The bill also requires the owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling to additionally post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous location in the lobby or common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, in which the information is most likely to be viewed by residents or guests, and within ten feet of the elevator on each floor of the hotel or multiple dwelling, or, if the hotel or multiple dwelling does not have an elevator, within ten feet of, or in, the main stairwell of each floor.  The bill permits a notice posted in a common area pursuant to this bill to be removed only after the commissioner issues the owner and operator a certificate of inspection.  For a hotel room or dwelling unit impacted by a potentially hazardous violation, the bill restricts the owner or operator of any hotel or multiple dwelling from entering a new lease for non-owner occupancy, or make available for a new lease, for such time as the hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the HMDL. The bill would take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment to provide time for the Commissioner of Community Affairs to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this bill.

(cf: P.L.2013, c.253, s.53) 2.  Section 13 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-13) is amended to read as follows: 13.  (a)  Each multiple dwelling and each hotel shall be inspected  for the purpose of determining the extent to which each hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder.  The commissioner shall establish by regulation the frequency of inspections, which shall be conducted as follows: (1)   each hotel shall be inspected at least once every five years; and (2)   each multiple dwelling shall be categorized into the following tiers based upon the number of reinspections required to abate the violations that were served upon the owner following an initial inspection: (i)    a multiple dwelling in which no violations are found or all violations have been abated by the first reinspection shall be placed in the highest tier and shall next be inspected in seven years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (ii)   a multiple dwelling in which all violations have been abated by the second or third reinspection shall be placed in the middle tier and shall next be inspected in five years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time; (iii)  a multiple dwelling in which all violations have not been abated by the third reinspection shall be placed in the lowest tier and shall next be inspected in two years, and the inspection fee shall be due at that time. (3)   notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this section to the contrary, if the commissioner determines that tiered inspection schedules do not adequately protect the health and safety of residents of multiple dwellings, the commissioner may, by regulation, require that cyclical inspections for multiple dwellings occur once every five years. (b)   Within 30 days of the most recent inspection, the owner of each hotel shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows: $15 per unit of dwelling space for the first 20 units of dwelling space in any building or project, $12 per unit of dwelling space for the 21st through 100th unit in any building or project, $8 per unit of dwelling space for the 101st through 250th unit in any building or project, and $5 per unit of dwelling space for all units over 250 in any building or project, except that in the case of hotels open and operating less than six months in each year the fee shall be one-half that which would otherwise be required, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for hotels in the amount of $10 for each dwelling unit reinspected or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Within 30 days of the most recent inspection of any multiple dwelling occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more persons living independently of each other, the owner of each such multiple dwelling shall file with the commissioner, upon forms provided by the commissioner, an application for a certificate of inspection.  Said application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied by a fee of $33 per unit of dwelling space for the first 7 units in any building or project, $21 per unit of dwelling space for the 8th through the 24th unit in any building or project, $18 per unit for the 25th through the 48th unit in any building or project, and $12 per unit of dwelling space for all units of dwelling space over 48 in any building or project, provided that the maximum total fee for owner-occupied three-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $65 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, and the maximum total fee for owner-occupied four-unit multiple dwellings shall be limited to $80 for owners having a household income that is less than 80 percent of the median income for households of similar size in the county in which the multiple dwelling is located, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule for each of the foregoing pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.  A certificate of inspection and the fees therefor shall not be required more often than once each inspection cycle. Additionally, there shall be reinspection fees for multiple dwellings in the amount of $40 for each dwelling unit reinspected, or, as the case may be, the fees established by rule pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, but only after the first reinspection. The commissioner may waive the inspection fee for any unit upon a finding that the unit has been thoroughly inspected within the previous 12-month period under a municipal ordinance requiring inspection upon change of occupancy in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and has received a municipal certificate of occupancy as a result of that inspection. If the commissioner finds that (1) a building has been thoroughly inspected prior to resale since the most recent inspection in accordance with this section, (2) the inspection prior to resale was conducted by the municipality in accordance with the maintenance standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and (3) a municipal certificate of occupancy was issued as a result of that inspection, the commissioner may accept the inspection done prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection under this section.  If the commissioner accepts an inspection prior to resale in lieu of a current inspection, no fee shall be charged for any inspection done by the commissioner within the years remaining in the applicable inspection cycle after the date of the inspection so accepted. (c)   If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling complies with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated hereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof, upon receipt of the application and fee as required by subsection (b) of this section, a certificate of inspection.  Any owner to whom a certificate of inspection is issued shall keep said certificate posted in a conspicuous location in the hotel or multiple dwelling to which the certificate applies.  The certificate of inspection shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner may, upon finding a consistent pattern of compliance with the maintenance standards established under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) in at least 20 percent of the units in a building or project, issue a certificate of inspection for the building or project, in which case the inspection fee shall be charged on the basis of the number of units inspected. The commissioner may by rule establish standards for self-inspection by condominium associations exercising control over buildings of not more than three stories, constructed after 1976, and certified by the local enforcing agency having jurisdiction as being in compliance with the Uniform Fire Code promulgated pursuant to P.L.1983, c.383 (C.52:27D-192 et seq.), in which at least 80 percent of the dwelling units are occupied by the unit owners.  The commissioner shall issue a certificate of acceptance, which shall be in lieu of a certificate of inspection, upon acceptance of any such self-inspection and upon payment of a fee of $25. (d)  (1)  If the commissioner determines, as a result of the most recent inspection of any hotel or multiple dwelling as required by subsection (a) of this section, that any hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a written notice stating the manner in which any such hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder. Said notice shall fix such date, not less than 60 days nor more than 180 days, on or before which any such hotel or multiple dwelling must comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section.  If any such hotel or multiple dwelling is not made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder on or before the date fixed in said notice, then the commissioner shall not issue to the owner thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section, and shall enforce the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) against the owner thereof. (2)  In addition to complying with the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection, if the commissioner determines that a violation of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) is a potentially hazardous violation, then the commissioner shall comply with this paragraph, and shall immediately send, by certified or ordinary mail, and by electronic mail, a written notice, stating the manner in which the hotel or multiple dwelling does not comply with P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) or regulations promulgated thereunder, to: (i)  The mayor of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; (ii)  The administrator, business administrator, city manager, township manager, municipal manager, or other municipal official with executive authority not vested in the mayor of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located, as is applicable to the municipality; (iii)  All members of the governing body of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; (iv) The clerk, public information officer, or other municipal official responsible for the distribution of communications to the residents of the municipality, as applicable to the municipality; and (v)  The owner and operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling, including, if applicable, to the property owners last known address, as determined through a review of local property tax and other available records. (3)  If a notice issued by the commissioner pursuant to this subsection concerns a potentially hazardous violation, then, in addition to complying with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the commissioner and the owner and operator of a hotel or multiple dwelling shall comply with this paragraph, and the commissioner shall include as a part of the notice a mailing notification that shall contain large, easily readable text and be presented on distinctly colored paper or other paper that is easily distinguishable from other notices or communications otherwise sent by the commissioner.  The owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling shall provide a hard copy of said mailing notification to each existing resident or guest of the hotel or multiple dwelling.  The owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling shall additionally post a copy of the notification in a conspicuous location in the lobby or common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, in which the information is most likely to be viewed by residents or guests; and within ten feet of the elevator on each floor of the hotel or multiple dwelling, or, if the hotel or multiple dwelling does not have an elevator, within ten feet of, or in, the main stairwell of each floor.  A notification posted in a common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, pursuant to this subsection, may be removed only after the commissioner issues to the owner and operator a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section.  For a hotel room or dwelling unit impacted by a potentially hazardous violation, the owner or operator of any hotel or multiple dwelling shall not enter a new lease for non-owner occupancy, or make available for the same, such unit for such time as the hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the provisions of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and regulations promulgated thereunder and the commissioner has issued to the owner and operator thereof a certificate of inspection as described in subsection (c) of this section. (e)   The commissioner shall annually review the cost of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), including the cost to municipalities of carrying out inspections pursuant to section 21 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-21), and shall establish by rule, not more frequently than once every three years, such fees as may be necessary to cover the costs of such implementation and enforcement; provided, however, that any increase or decrease shall be applied as a uniform percentage to each category of fee established herein, and provided, further, that the percentage amount of any increase shall not exceed the percentage increase in salaries paid to State employees since the then current fee schedule was established.  The commissioner shall provide by rule to owners the option of paying inspection fees in installments in the form of an annual fee. The commissioner shall annually prepare and file with the presiding officers of the Senate and General Assembly and the legislative committees having jurisdiction in housing matters a report setting forth the amounts of fees and penalties received by the Bureau of Housing Inspection, the cost to the bureau of enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), and information concerning the productivity of the bureau.  Copies of the report shall also be submitted to the Office of Administrative Law for publication in the New Jersey Register.  If in any State fiscal year the fee revenue received by the bureau exceeds the cost of enforcement of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), the excess revenue shall be distributed pro rata to persons who paid inspection fees during that fiscal year.  Such distribution shall be made within three months after the end of the fiscal year. (f)   Except as otherwise provided in section 2 of P.L.1991, c.179 (C.55:13A-26.1), the fees established by or pursuant to the provisions of this section are dedicated to meeting the costs of implementing and enforcing P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) and shall not be used for any other purpose.  All receipts in excess of $2,200,000 are hereby appropriated for the purposes of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2019, c.202, s.2) 3.  Section 20 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-20) is amended to read as follows: 20.  (a)        Notices, rules, decisions, and orders required or permitted to be issued and served pursuant to P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.), except as otherwise provided for a notice of noncompliance issued for a potentially hazardous violation pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subsection (d) of section 13 of P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-13), shall be served as follows: (1)   On the owner: (i)    By mailing same by certified or ordinary mail to the person designated as owner or agent on the certificate of registration or in the municipal tax records or in the records of the Department of the Treasury; or (ii)   By serving same on the owner, or upon a person authorized to accept service on behalf of the owner in a civil matter, in accordance with the Rules of Court.

(cf: P.L.2019, c.202, s.3) 4.  On or before the first day of the third month next following the enactment of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the Commissioner of Community Affairs shall adopt, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedures Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), rules and regulations as necessary for the implementation of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 5.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment, except that the Commissioner of Community Affairs may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). STATEMENT This bill would enhance notice requirements and occupancy restrictions for hotels and multiple dwellings following a determination of a potentially hazardous condition through an inspection conducted pursuant to the "Hotel and Multiple Dwelling Law," P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) (HMDL).  As used in the bill, potentially hazardous conditions would consist of imminent hazards to health, safety or welfare, or a deteriorating structural, sanitary, or other condition that, if unaddressed, may result in an imminent hazard prior to the next scheduled inspection conducted pursuant to the HMDL. The bill provides that, if the Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) determines that a violation of the HMDL is a potentially hazardous violation, then the commissioner would be required to immediately send, by certified or ordinary mail, and by electronic mail, a written notice, stating the manner in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is out of compliance, to: · The mayor of the municipality; · The administrator, business administrator, city manager, township manager, municipal manager, or other municipal official with executive authority not vested in the mayor of the municipality; · All members of the governing body of the municipality in which the hotel or multiple dwelling is located; · The clerk, public information officer, or other municipal official responsible for the distribution of communications to the residents of the municipality; and · The owner and operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling, including, if applicable, to the property owners last known address. Concerning a potentially hazardous violation, the bill requires the commissioner to include the notice in a mailing with large, easily readable text, presented on paper that is easily distinguishable from other notices or communications.  The bill requires the owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling to provide a hard copy of the notice to each existing resident or guest of the hotel or multiple dwelling.  The bill also requires the owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling to additionally post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous location in the lobby or common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, in which the information is most likely to be viewed by residents or guests, and within ten feet of the elevator on each floor of the hotel or multiple dwelling, or, if the hotel or multiple dwelling does not have an elevator, within ten feet of, or in, the main stairwell of each floor.  The bill permits a notice posted in a common area pursuant to this bill to be removed only after the commissioner issues the owner and operator a certificate of inspection.  For a hotel room or dwelling unit impacted by a potentially hazardous violation, the bill restricts the owner or operator of any hotel or multiple dwelling from entering a new lease for non-owner occupancy, or make available for a new lease, for such time as the hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the HMDL. The bill would take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment to provide time for the Commissioner of Community Affairs to adopt rules and regulations to implement the provisions of this bill.
