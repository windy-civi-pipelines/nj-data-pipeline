inspected at least once every five years; and</p>

application shall be accompanied by a fee as follows: $15 per unit of dwelling
space for the first 20 units of dwelling space in any building or project, $12
per unit of dwelling space for the 21st through 100th unit in any building or
project, $8 per unit of dwelling space for the 101st through 250th unit in any

application shall include such information as the commissioner shall prescribe
to enforce the provisions of this law.  Said application shall be accompanied

building or project, $21 per unit of dwelling space for the 8th through the
24th unit in any building or project, $18 per unit for the 25th through the
48th unit in any building or project, and $12 per unit of dwelling space for
all units of dwelling space over 48 in any building or project, provided that
the maximum total fee for owner-occupied three-unit multiple dwellings shall be

standards established by the commissioner under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et
seq.), and (3) a municipal certificate of occupancy was issued as a result of
that inspection, the commissioner may accept the inspection done prior to
resale in lieu of a current inspection under this section.  If the commissioner

to the owner thereof, upon receipt of the application and fee as required by
subsection (b) of this section, a certificate of inspection.  Any owner to whom
a certificate of inspection is issued shall keep said certificate posted in a
conspicuous location in the hotel or multiple dwelling to which the certificate
applies.  The certificate of inspection shall be in such form as may be
prescribed by the commissioner.</p>

finding a consistent pattern of compliance with the maintenance standards
established under P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) in at least 20 percent of
the units in a building or project, issue a certificate of inspection for the
building or project, in which case the inspection fee shall be charged on the
basis of the number of units inspected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The commissioner may by rule
establish standards for self-inspection by condominium associations exercising

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would enhance notice
requirements and occupancy restrictions for hotels and multiple dwellings
following a determination of a potentially hazardous condition through an
inspection conducted pursuant to the &quot;Hotel and Multiple Dwelling
Law,&quot; P.L.1967, c.76 (C.55:13A-1 et seq.) (HMDL).  As used in the bill,
potentially hazardous conditions would consist of imminent hazards to health,
safety or welfare, or a deteriorating structural, sanitary, or other condition
that, if unaddressed, may result in an imminent hazard prior to the next
scheduled inspection conducted pursuant to the HMDL.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill provides that, if the
Commissioner of Community Affairs (commissioner) determines that a violation of
the HMDL is a potentially hazardous violation, then the commissioner would be
required to immediately send, by certified or ordinary mail, and by electronic
mail, a written notice, stating the manner in which the hotel or multiple
dwelling is out of compliance, to:</p>

style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

the hotel or multiple dwelling is located;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>The owner and operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling,
including, if applicable, to the property owners last known address.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Concerning a potentially hazardous
violation, the bill requires the commissioner to include the notice in a
mailing with large, easily readable text, presented on paper that is easily
distinguishable from other notices or communications.  The bill requires the
owner or operator of the hotel or multiple dwelling to provide a hard copy of
the notice to each existing resident or guest of the hotel or multiple
dwelling.  The bill also requires the owner or operator of the hotel or
multiple dwelling to additionally post a copy of the notice in a conspicuous
location in the lobby or common area of the hotel or multiple dwelling, in which
the information is most likely to be viewed by residents or guests, and within
ten feet of the elevator on each floor of the hotel or multiple dwelling, or,
if the hotel or multiple dwelling does not have an elevator, within ten feet
of, or in, the main stairwell of each floor.  The bill permits a notice posted
in a common area pursuant to this bill to be removed only after the
commissioner issues the owner and operator a certificate of inspection.  For a
hotel room or dwelling unit impacted by a potentially hazardous violation, the
bill restricts the owner or operator of any hotel or multiple dwelling from
entering a new lease for non-owner occupancy, or make available for a new
lease, for such time as the hotel or multiple dwelling is made to comply with the
HMDL.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would take effect on
the first day of the third month next following enactment to provide time for
the Commissioner of Community Affairs to adopt rules and regulations to
implement the provisions of this bill.</p>
