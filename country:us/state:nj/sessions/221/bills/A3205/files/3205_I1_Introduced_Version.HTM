The commissioner shall use the survey results to publish an annual report on the effectiveness of the customer service intake telephone system. It is the view of the sponsor that this pilot program is necessary because of public dissatisfaction with the Department of Labor and Workforce Development, including claimant reports of rudeness during telephone interactions with the department.
