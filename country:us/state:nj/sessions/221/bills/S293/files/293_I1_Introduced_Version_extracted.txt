Currently, both statutes consider a child to be abused or neglected if the abuse or neglect is committed or is allowed to be committed by a parent or legal guardian, but does not consider such acts to be abuse or neglect if they are committed by a person who is not the childs parent or a legal guardian, including another person under the age of 18.
