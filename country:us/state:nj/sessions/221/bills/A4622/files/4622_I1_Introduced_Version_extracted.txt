STATEMENT This bill increases the resource threshold for certain non-Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid eligibility groups, or those applicants who are over 65 years of age or disabled, such as individuals eligible for nursing homes services; Medicare Shared Savings Programs; the Medically Needy pathway; and home and community-based services.  This bill does alter any eligibility requirements regarding the NJ Workability Program, a non-MAGI eligibilty pathway which offers full Medicaid coverage to working disabled individuals whose income or assets would otherwise make them ineligible.  Currently, NJ Workability does not limit eligibility based on resources. Generally, in increasing the resource standard under these programs, this bill more closely aligns resource requirements under Medicaid for these populations with individuals under 65 years of age without disabilities, also known as the MAGI eligibility group, who currently do not have a resource test to determine eligibility pursuant to the federal Affordable Care Act. The current resource standards for the affected eligibility groups varies.  For example, an individual applying for the Medicaid Managed Long-Term Services and Supports is required to have resources of less than $2,000, while an individual applying for a Medicare Savings Program can have resources up to $9,090.

STATEMENT This bill increases the resource threshold for certain non-Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid eligibility groups, or those applicants who are over 65 years of age or disabled, such as individuals eligible for nursing homes services; Medicare Shared Savings Programs; the Medically Needy pathway; and home and community-based services.  This bill does alter any eligibility requirements regarding the NJ Workability Program, a non-MAGI eligibilty pathway which offers full Medicaid coverage to working disabled individuals whose income or assets would otherwise make them ineligible.  Currently, NJ Workability does not limit eligibility based on resources. Generally, in increasing the resource standard under these programs, this bill more closely aligns resource requirements under Medicaid for these populations with individuals under 65 years of age without disabilities, also known as the MAGI eligibility group, who currently do not have a resource test to determine eligibility pursuant to the federal Affordable Care Act. The current resource standards for the affected eligibility groups varies.  For example, an individual applying for the Medicaid Managed Long-Term Services and Supports is required to have resources of less than $2,000, while an individual applying for a Medicare Savings Program can have resources up to $9,090.
