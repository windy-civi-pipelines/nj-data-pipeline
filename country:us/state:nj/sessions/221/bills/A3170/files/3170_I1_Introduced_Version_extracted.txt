STATEMENT This bill authorizes special Combat Action Ribbon license plates.  The license plate is to display the words "Combat Action Ribbon" and the Combat Action Ribbon emblem.  An application to obtain Combat Action Ribbon license plates is to include satisfactory proof that the applicant received the Combat Action Ribbon.  In addition to the required motor vehicle registration fees, there is an application fee of $50 and an annual renewal fee of $10 for the Combat Action Ribbon license plates.  After deducting the cost of producing and publicizing the plates, the additional fees collected will be deposited into the Combat Action Ribbon License Fund and the funds will be appropriated annually to the New Jersey Department of Military Veterans Affairs (department) for programs to benefit combat veterans. The Chief Administrator of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (commission) is required to annually certify the average cost of producing, issuing, and publicizing the availability of the specialty license plates. If the average cost per plate exceeds $50, the chief administrator may discontinue the license plate program. The bill provides that no State or other public funds may be used by the commission for the initial cost to implement the Combat Action Ribbon license plate program. The bill authorizes the department to receive funds, in an amount not to exceed a total of $25,000, from private sources to be used to offset the initial costs incurred by the commission for designing, producing, issuing, and publicizing the availability of the license plates. The provisions of the bill are to remain inoperative until the commission receives the initial funds. The bill will expire if the funds to initiate the license plate program are not received within 12 months of the effective date. The Combat Action Ribbon was approved for creation by the Secretary of the Navy on February 17, 1969.  The honor was created to provide special recognition to any member of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, when the Coast Guard was under the control of the Navy, who actively participated in ground or surface combat.
