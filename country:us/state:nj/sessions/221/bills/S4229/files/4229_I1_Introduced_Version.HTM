<p class=HangingAnAct style='line-height:150%'><span class=BillHead>An Act</span><span
class=HangingAnActChar> concerning </span>the dissemination of information
related to the heroin and opioid drug epidemic, designated as the HOPE
Initiative Act, and supplementing Chapter 2G of Title 26 of the Revised
Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     <span class=BillHeading2>Be It
Enacted </span><span class=BillLanguage>by the Senate and General Assembly of
the State of New Jersey:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    This act shall be known,
and may be cited, as the HOPE Initiative Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The Legislature finds
and declares that:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     There is an epidemic in
this State stemming from the use of heroin and the abuse of opioid medications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    In order for the State
to combat this epidemic, citizens in all walks of life must be alerted to the
problem and armed with information that will allow them to recognize, and undertake
appropriate actions, when they or their loved ones are at risk of, or are
succumbing to, a heroin or opioid addiction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The widespread
dissemination of information necessary to combat the States heroin and opioid
epidemic could be successfully achieved through the institution and maintenance
of a multicultural Statewide public awareness campaign, which would be
carefully coordinated, through all available multimedia channels, to reach a
wide variety of audiences, including drug users, their family members and
friends, medical practitioners and nurses, emergency personnel, and employers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    In order to be
successful, the public awareness campaign that is used to combat the States
growing heroin and opioid epidemic must be designed to:  (1) educate the public
as to the reasons why ordinary people may engage in the abuse of opioid
medications and the associated use of heroin; (2) rebut the commonly accepted
myths and stereotypes associated with heroin use and opioid abuse; and (3)
stigmatize and condemn the abuse and diversion of prescription opioid drugs,
while still recognizing the legitimate use of those same drugs as medications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    a.  The Division of
Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human Services, in
consultation with the Governors Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, the
Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey, and, as appropriate, the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration, shall develop, coordinate, implement, and oversee a
comprehensive multicultural public awareness campaign to be known as the
Heroin and Opioid Drug Public Education (HOPE) Initiative, which shall allow
for the coordinated and widespread dissemination of information designed to
combat the growing heroin and opioid epidemic in this State.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Using the means
described in subsection c. of this section, the HOPE Initiative shall provide
for the coordinated and widespread public dissemination of individual case
stories and other generalized information that is designed to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   identify the pathways
that can lead to opioid abuse and heroin use, and the reasons why opioid abuse
may evolve into heroin use;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   show the new face of
heroin and opioid addiction, and rebut the commonly accepted myths and
stereotypes about heroin users and opioid abusers, including the myth that all
heroin users are back-alley denizens;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   condemn and stigmatize
the abuse and diversion of prescription opioid drugs, while recognizing the
legitimate use of those same opioid drugs as medications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   describe the effects and
warning signs of heroin use and opioid abuse, so as to better enable members of
the public to determine when help is needed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   show the link that
exists between heroin and opioid addiction and suicidal behavior; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   identify the pathways
that are available for individuals to seek help in association with their own,
or another persons, opioid or heroin addiction, and indicate the various
telephone hotline systems that exist in the State for persons who wish to
report a case of drug abuse or engage in substance abuse treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (7)   highlight the provisions
of the Overdose Prevention Act, P.L.2013, c.46 (C.24:6J-1 et seq.) that
provide for the application of civil and criminal immunity to persons who seek
medical assistance for a drug overdose; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (8)   highlight the
availability of naloxone hydrochloride as a means to avert death from a heroin
or opioid overdose, identify pathways for members of the public to obtain a
prescription for naloxone and training in the emergency administration of
naloxone, and promote the proper use of naloxone in crisis situations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (9)   highlight the benefits
of substance abuse treatment and the potential for such treatment to allow for
the reclaiming of lives that have been upset by addiction, and underscore the
fact that relapses occur not because treatment is ineffective, but because of
the nature of addiction, which is a recurring, relapsing disorder;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10)  highlight the benefits
of medication-assisted therapy using methadone, buprenorphine, or other similar
drugs, and de-stigmatize the use of such medication-assisted therapy;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11)  identify the methods
that can be used by an individual to help finance the costs of substance abuse
treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (12)  identify the steps that
individuals can take to prevent and deter family members, friends, students,
patients, co-workers, and others from first experimenting with inappropriately
obtained prescription opioid medications, and from misusing or mismanaging
lawfully prescribed opioid medications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (13)  identify the proper
methods for safeguarding, and for safely disposing of, legitimately prescribed
opioid medications; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (14) address any other issues
that the division may deem appropriate and necessary to proactively educate the
public about the States heroin and opioid epidemic and the actions that can be

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would require the
Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services in the Department of Human
Services to establish and oversee a public awareness campaign that would be
known as the Heroin and Opioid Drug Public Education (HOPE) Initiative.  The
HOPE Initiative would be designed to combat the growing heroin and opioid
epidemic in this State by educating the public about the dangers and causes of
heroin and opioid addiction, and the appropriate responses thereto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill would require the
division to work in consultation with the Governors Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Abuse, the Partnership for a Drug-Free New Jersey, and, as appropriate,
the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, in developing, coordinating,
implementing, and overseeing the HOPE Initiative.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The HOPE Initiative would
provide for the coordinated and widespread public dissemination of individual
case stories and other generalized information that is designed to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          identify the pathways
that can lead to opioid abuse and heroin use, and the reasons why opioid abuse
may evolve into heroin use;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          show the new face of
heroin and opioid addiction, and rebut the commonly accepted myths and
stereotypes about heroin users and opioid abusers;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          condemn and stigmatize
the abuse and diversion of prescription opioid drugs, while recognizing the
legitimate use of those same opioid drugs as medications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          describe the effects and
warning signs of heroin use and opioid abuse, so as to better enable members of
the public to determine when help is needed;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          show the link that
exists between heroin and opioid addiction and suicidal behavior; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          identify the pathways
that are available for individuals to seek help in association with their own,
or another persons, opioid or heroin addiction, and indicate the various
telephone hotline systems that exist in the State for persons who wish to
report a case of drug abuse or engage in substance abuse treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          highlight the provisions

provide for the application of civil and criminal immunity to persons who seek
medical assistance for a drug overdose; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          highlight the
availability of naloxone hydrochloride as a means to avert death from a heroin
or opioid overdose, identify pathways for members of the public to obtain a
prescription for naloxone and training in the emergency administration of
naloxone, and promote the proper use of naloxone in crisis situations;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          highlight the benefits
of substance abuse treatment and the capacity of such treatment to allow for
the reclaiming of lives that have been upset by addiction, and underscore the
fact that relapses occur not because treatment is ineffective, but because of
the nature of addiction, which is a recurring, relapsing disorder;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          highlight the benefits
of medication-assisted therapy using methadone, buprenorphine, or other similar
drugs, and de-stigmatize the use of such medication-assisted therapy;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          identify the methods
that can be used by an individual to help finance the costs of substance abuse
treatment;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          identify the steps that
individuals can take to prevent and deter family members, friends, students,
patients, co-workers, and others from first experimenting with inappropriately
obtained prescription opioid medications, and from misusing or mismanaging
lawfully prescribed opioid medications;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          identify the proper
methods for safeguarding, and for safely disposing of, legitimately prescribed
opioid medications; and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>          address any other issues
that the division may deem appropriate and necessary to proactively educate the
public about the States heroin and opioid epidemic and the actions that can be
taken by members of the public to mitigate the epidemics effects.</p>
