STATEMENT This bill requires an electric public utility to submit a transmission project proposal (proposal) to the Board of Public Utilities (board) for approval prior to undertaking a transmission project.  The proposal is required to, at a minimum:  (1) identify the projects potential impact on the environment, scenic sights, historic sites, and public safety; (2) document all costs associated with undertaking the project; (3) indicate whether the project meets a demonstrated need, which need may be established by the projects provision of certain public benefits; and (4) identify alternative project ideas, if any, that meet the same demonstrated need but for a lower total project cost.  Within 90 days of the boards receipt of a proposal, the board is required to determine if the proposal is reasonable, within the public interest, and cost effective.  In addition, the board is required to approve the proposal if the board determines that the proposal is reasonable, within the public interest, and cost effective. Under the bill, a transmission project is defined to mean a project undertaken by an electric public utility to construct a new transmission line or modify an existing transmission line. It is the sponsors intent to require an electric public utility to receive approval from the board prior to undertaking a transmission project in response to the testimony provided by the Director of the Division of Rate Counsel (director) during the October 2, 2024 Assembly Telecommunications and Utilities Committee meeting.  The director indicated in his testimony that requiring board review of transmission projects prior to their start could reduce transmission costs by ensuring that each transmission project is needed and is the lowest cost solution.
