STATEMENT This bill limits the purposes for which genetic testing may be conducted on DNA samples taken from newborns and crime victims. Current law generally requires the informed consent of a person, or persons representative, in order to obtain a persons genetic information.  However, this informed consent requirement does not apply to the use of a persons DNA by a State, county, municipal or federal law enforcement agency for the purposes of establishing the identity of a person in the course of a criminal investigation or prosecution, or for the purposes of newborn screening.  Recent reports indicate that DNA samples of newborns, crime victims, and witnesses have been used to convict a family member of the newborn, the crime victim or witness, or a member of the victims or witness family. Under the bill, a DNA sample from a victim of or witness to a crime is only to be used to establish the identity of a person who is the subject of the criminal investigation or prosecution for which the sample was obtained.  The provisions of the bill further provide that a DNA sample taken from a newborn may only be used for the purpose of detecting disorders or conditions for which newborn screening is explicitly authorized pursuant to the States Newborn Screening Program in the Department of Health. The bill permits a person to obtain genetic information from an individual pursuant to a validly executed warrant or upon an order of a court of competent jurisdiction.  Further, a person may disclose or be compelled to disclose the identity of an individual upon whom a genetic test has been performed pursuant to a validly executed warrant.
