STATEMENT The purpose of this bill is to clarify and strengthen the disclosure requirements for certain types of complimentary tickets received by candidates, officeholders, political party officials and members of political committees and continuing political committees. Specifically, the bill is concerned with complimentary tickets to political fundraisers or events which are purchased by a person, organization or association and then given free of charge to a candidate, officeholder, political party official or member of a political committee or continuing political committee.  In such a situation, the recipients are required to report to ELEC the receipt of complimentary tickets and they are to be considered in-kind contributions to the candidate, officeholder, official or member of a political committee or continuing political committee who uses the tickets to attend a fundraiser or event if either the face value or purchase price of each ticket is greater than $200.  Any such tickets given to a candidate, officeholder, political party official or member of a political committee or continuing political committee and not used thereby need not be reported to ELEC.  But if such tickets are given by a candidate, officeholder, official or member to another candidate, officeholder, official or member, the ultimate users of the tickets shall be considered to have received a reportable in-kind contribution from the candidate, officeholder, official or member providing the tickets were used.
