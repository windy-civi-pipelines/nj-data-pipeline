<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1. Section 3 of P.L.1973, c.83
(C.19:44A-3) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3. As used in this act, unless
a different meaning clearly appears from the context:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a. (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1993, c.65.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b. (Deleted by amendment,
P.L.1993, c.65.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c. The term
&quot;candidate&quot; means: (1) an individual seeking election to a public
office of the State or of a county, municipality or school district at an
election; except that the term shall not include an individual seeking party
office; (2) an individual who shall have been elected or failed of election to
an office, other than a party office, for which he sought election and who
receives contributions and makes expenditures for any of the purposes
authorized by section 17 of P.L.1993, c.65 (C.19:44A-11.2) during the period of
his service in that office; and (3) an individual who has received funds or
other benefits or has made payments solely for the purpose of determining
whether the individual should become a candidate as defined in paragraphs (1)
and (2) of this subsection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d. The terms
&quot;contributions&quot; and &quot;expenditures&quot; include all loans and
transfers of money or other thing of value to or by any candidate, candidate
committee, joint candidates committee, political committee, continuing
political committee, independent expenditure committee, political party
committee or legislative leadership committee, and all pledges or other
commitments or assumptions of liability to make any such transfer; and for
purposes of reports required under the provisions of this act shall be deemed

assumed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     e. The term
&quot;election&quot; means any election described in section 4 of this act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     f. The term &quot;paid
personal services&quot; means personal, clerical, administrative or

than the committee, candidate or organization for whom such services are
rendered.  In determining the value, for the purpose of reports required under
this act, of contributions made in the form of paid personal services, the
person contributing such services shall furnish to the treasurer through whom
such contribution is made a statement setting forth the actual amount of compensation
paid by said contributor to the individuals actually performing said services
for the performance thereof.  But if any individual or individuals actually
performing such services also performed for the contributor other services
during the same period, and the manner of payment was such that payment for the
services contributed cannot readily be segregated from contemporary payment for
the other services, the contributor shall in his statement to the treasurer so
state and shall either (1) set forth his best estimate of the dollar amount of
payment to each such individual which is attributable to the contribution of
his paid personal services, and shall certify the substantial accuracy of the
same, or (2) if unable to determine such amount with sufficient accuracy, set
forth the total compensation paid by him to each such individual for the period
of time during which the services contributed by him were performed.  If any
candidate is a holder of public office to whom there is attached or assigned,
by virtue of said office, any aide or aides whose services are of a personal or
confidential nature in assisting him to carry out the duties of said office,
and whose salary or other compensation is paid in whole or part out of public
funds, the services of such aide or aides which are paid for out of public
funds shall be for public purposes only; but they may contribute their personal
services, on a voluntary basis, to such candidate for election campaign
purposes.</p>
