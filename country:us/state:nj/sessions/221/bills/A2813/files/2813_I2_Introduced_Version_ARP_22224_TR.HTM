powers conferred by state law, a remote state shall have the authority, in
accordance with existing state due process law, to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Take adverse action
against a regulated social workers multistate authorization to practice only
within that member state, and issue subpoenas for both hearings and
investigations that require the attendance and testimony of witnesses as well
as the production of evidence.  Subpoenas issued by a licensing authority in a
member state for the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of
evidence from another member state shall be enforced in the latter state by any
court of competent jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of
that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings pending before it. 
The issuing licensing authority shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses,
mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which
the witnesses or evidence are located.</p>

adverse action, the home state shall give the same priority and effect to
reported conduct received from a member state as it would if the conduct had
occurred within the home state.  In so doing, the home state shall apply its
own state laws to determine appropriate action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The home state shall
complete any pending investigations of a regulated social worker who changes
their home state during the course of the investigations.  The home state shall
also have the authority to take appropriate action and shall promptly report
the conclusions of the investigations to the administrator of the data system. 
The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the new home state
of any adverse actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    A member state, if
otherwise permitted by state law, may recover from the affected regulated
social worker the costs of investigations and dispositions of cases resulting
from any adverse action taken against that regulated social worker.</p>

adverse action based on the factual findings of another member state, provided
that the member state follows its own procedures for taking the adverse action.</p>

member states in joint investigations of licensees.</p>

share any investigative, litigation, or compliance materials in furtherance of
any joint or individual investigation initiated under the compact.</p>

taken by the home state against the multistate license of a regulated social
worker, the regulated social workers multistate authorization to practice in
all other member states shall be deactivated until all encumbrances have been
removed from the multistate license.  All home state disciplinary orders that
impose adverse action against the license of a regulated social worker shall
include a statement that the regulated social workers multistate authorization
to practice is deactivated in all member states until all conditions of the
decision, order or agreement are satisfied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    If a member state takes
adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. 
The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home state and
all other member states of any adverse actions by remote states.</p>

shall override a member states decision that participation in an alternative
program may be used in lieu of adverse action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    The commission shall promulgate
reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently implement and
administer the purposes and provisions of the compact.  A rule shall be invalid
and have no force or effect only if a court of competent jurisdiction holds
that the rule is invalid because the commission exercised its rulemaking
authority in a manner that is beyond the scope and purposes of the compact, or
the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable standard of
review.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    The rules of the
commission shall have the force of law in each member state, provided however
that where the rules of the commission conflict with the laws of the member
state that establish the member states laws, regulations, and applicable
standards that govern the practice of social work as held by a court of
competent jurisdiction, the rules of the commission shall be ineffective in
that state to the extent of the conflict.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    The commission shall
exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this
section and the rules adopted thereunder.  Rules shall become binding on the
day following adoption or the date specified in the rule or amendment,
whichever is later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    If a majority of the
legislatures of the member states rejects a rule or portion of a rule, by enactment
of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact within
four years of the date of adoption of the rule, then such rule shall have no
further force and effect in any member state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    Rules shall be adopted
at a regular or special meeting of the commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Prior to adoption of a
proposed rule, the commission shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to
provide oral and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.    Prior to adoption of a
proposed rule by the commission, and at least 30 days in advance of the meeting
at which the commission will hold a public hearing on the proposed rule, the
commission shall provide a notice of proposed rulemaking:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     On the website of the
commission or other publicly accessible platform; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To persons who have
requested notice of the commissions notices of proposed rulemaking; and</p>

the commission may by rule specify.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    The notice of proposed
rulemaking shall include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The time, date, and location
of the public hearing at which the commission will hear public comments on the
proposed rule and, if different, the time, date, and location of the meeting
where the commission will consider and vote on the proposed rule;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    If the hearing is held
via telecommunication, video conference, or other electronic means, the
commission shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in the notice

proposed rule and the reason therefor;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    A request for comments

received by the commission in response to the proposed rule shall be available
to the public.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     10.  Nothing in this section
shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule.  Rules may be
grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     11.  The commission shall, by
majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule based on
the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The commission may
adopt changes to the proposed rule provided the changes do not enlarge the
original purpose of the proposed rule.</p>

provide an explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to the
proposed rule as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that were
recommended by commenters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The commission shall
determine a reasonable effective date for the rule.  Except for an emergency as
provided in section 12 of this article, the effective date of the rule shall be
no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice that it adopted or amended the
rule.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     12.  Upon determination that
an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule
with 48 hours notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the usual
rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be
retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event
later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule.  For the purposes of
this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in
order to:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Meet an imminent threat
to public health, safety, or welfare;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Prevent a loss of
commission or member state funds;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     Meet a deadline for the
promulgation of a rule that is established by federal law or rule; or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     d.    Protect public health
and safety.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     13.  The commission or an
authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously
adopted rule for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format,
errors in consistency, or grammatical errors.  Public notice of any revisions
shall be posted on the website of the commission.  The revision shall be
subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting.  The
revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a
material change to a rule.  A challenge shall be made in writing and delivered
to the commission prior to the end of the notice period.  If no challenge is
made, the revision will take effect without further action.  If the revision is
challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the
commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Oversight</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     The executive and
judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this
compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to implement the
compact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    Except as otherwise
provided in this compact, venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or
against the commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a court of
competent jurisdiction where the principal office of the commission is
located.  The commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to the
extent it adopts or consents to participate in alternative dispute resolution
proceedings.  Nothing herein shall affect or limit the selection or propriety
of venue in any action against a licensee for professional malpractice,
misconduct or any such similar matter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     c.     The commission shall be
entitled to receive service of process in any proceeding regarding the
enforcement or interpretation of the compact and shall have standing to
intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes.  Failure to provide the
commission service of process shall render a judgment or order void as to the
commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     2.    Default, Technical
Assistance, and Termination</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     If the commission
determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its
obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules,
the commission shall provide written notice to the defaulting state.  The
notice of default shall describe the default, the proposed means of curing the
default, and any other action that the commission may take, and shall offer
training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The commission shall
provide a copy of the notice of default to the other member states.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     3.    If a state in default
fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the
compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the member
states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that state by this
compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination.  A cure of the
default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities
incurred during the period of default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     4.    Termination of
membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of
securing compliance have been exhausted.  Notice of intent to suspend or terminate
shall be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority
leaders of the defaulting states legislature, the defaulting states licensing
authority and each of the member states licensing authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     5.    A state that has been
terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities
incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that
extend beyond the effective date of termination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     6.    Upon the termination of
a states membership from this compact, that state shall immediately provide
notice to all licensees within that state of such termination.  The terminated
state shall continue to recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact
for a minimum of six months after the date of said notice of termination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     7.  The commission shall not
bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has
been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the
commission and the defaulting state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    The defaulting state may
appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for
the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation,
including reasonable attorneys fees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     9.    Dispute Resolution</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     a.     Upon request by a
member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the
compact that arise among member states and between member and non-member
states.</p>

state in default in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices
to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated
rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages.  In
the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be
awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys fees. 
The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission.  The
commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or the
defaulting member states law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    A member state may
initiate legal action against the commission in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its
principal offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and
its promulgated rules.  The relief sought may include both injunctive relief
and damages.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing
party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable
attorneys fees.</p>

of such withdrawal to all licensees within that state.  Notwithstanding any
subsequent statutory enactment to the contrary, such withdrawing state shall
