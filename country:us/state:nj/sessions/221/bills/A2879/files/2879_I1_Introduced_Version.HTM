adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to subsection d. of section 6 of
P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-34), which shall be consistent with the intent of
P.L.2021, c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.).  The commission may create an expert task
force to make recommendations to the commission about the content of such
regulations. Such regulations shall include: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)   Procedures for the

whether the number of each class of cannabis establishment, or cannabis
distributors or cannabis delivery services, is sufficient to meet the market
demands of the State, a result of which is the commission's authority to accept
new applications and issue additional licenses as it deems necessary to meet
those demands, except as otherwise provided in section 33 of P.L.2021, c.16
(C.24:6I-46) regarding an initial period during which the number of Class 1

good faith efforts to meet these goals.  Qualifications for licensure shall be
directly and demonstrably related to the operation of a cannabis establishment,
distributor, or delivery service, provided that the commission shall make
licenses available to as diverse a group as reasonably practicable, however no
license of any kind shall be issued to a person under the legal age to purchase
cannabis items;</p>

the incorporated licensing measures established by the Office of Minority,
Disabled Veterans, and Women Cannabis Business Development, which shall include
a verification, as part of the application process for licensure or license
renewal, of a minority, women's, or disabled veterans' business certification

b. of section 32 of P.L.2019, c.153 (C.24:6I-25), or verification of an
