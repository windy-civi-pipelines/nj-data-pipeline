STATEMENT This bill clarifies that, for the purposes of insurance, a self-driving car must comply with compulsory automobile and motor vehicle insurance requirements. Current law provides, with certain limited exceptions, that every owner or registered owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State shall maintain motor vehicle liability insurance coverage.  This bill clarifies that this mandate includes self-driving motor vehicles that are capable of operating without active control or monitoring by a human operator. Further, the "New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act," P.L.1972, c.70 (C.39:6A-1 et seq.) created a system of no-fault insurance for private passenger automobiles.  The bill amends the definition of automobile under that act to include a self-driving private passenger automobile that is capable of operating without active control or monitoring by a human operator.  Therefore, the bill extends the requirements of the New Jersey Automobile Reparation Reform Act, including the requirement for owners and registrants to maintain liability insurance and the requirement that applicable insurance policies include personal injury protection benefits, to self-driving cars.
