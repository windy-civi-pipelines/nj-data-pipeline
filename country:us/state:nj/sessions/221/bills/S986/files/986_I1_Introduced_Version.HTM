No later than one year after the effective date of P.L.2021, c.262 (C.58:31-4.1
et al.), and each year thereafter, each water purveyor shall provide to the
department and the board, if applicable, a report based on its asset management
plan prepared pursuant to subsection a. of this section identifying: (1) the
infrastructure improvements completed in the past year and the cost of those
improvements, including improvements funded by emergency and routine capital
spending; (2) the infrastructure improvements generally planned to be
undertaken in the next three years and the estimated cost of those
improvements; and (3) the infrastructure improvements that  may be required
over the next 10 years and the estimated cost of those improvements.  A report
provided pursuant to this subsection by a municipality, county, or authority
that is a water purveyor, is subject to the Local Authorities Fiscal Control
Law, P.L.1983, c.313 (C.40A:5A-1 et seq.), and has a capital program extending
beyond three years shall also identify infrastructure improvements to be
undertaken pursuant to the asset management plan in the remaining years of the
capital program, along with the actual or estimated cost of the improvements.
Compliance with this subsection may be demonstrated through the submission of
evidence of completion of a detailed, comprehensive planning study, facility
master planning study, or other long range planning study that is intended for
use in developing three- and ten-year capital improvement plans.  A detailed
comprehensive planning study, facility master planning study, or other long
range planning study submitted pursuant to this subsection shall not be
considered a government record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.),
and shall not be made available for public inspection. A municipal water
department or municipal water authority shall also submit the report required
pursuant to this subsection to the Division of Local Government Services in the
Department of Community Affairs.  A water purveyor shall, upon request, provide
a copy of its asset management plan to the department, the board, or the
Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.</span></p>

department, the board, and the Department of Community Affairs shall create a

a report pursuant to subsection b. of this section.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     This bill would amend and
supplement the Water Supply Management Act, P.L.1981, c.262 (C.58:1A-1 et
seq.), to require the States water purveyors (i.e., public and private water
providers) who regularly serve at least 3,300 individuals to conduct annual
water loss audits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Specifically, beginning no
later than 24 months after the bill is enacted into law, every water purveyor
serving at least 3,300 individuals would be required to annually submit a water
loss audit to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).  The bill
directs the DEP, within 18 months after the bill is enacted into law, to adopt
regulations concerning the conduct and validation of water loss audits based on
the most current edition of the American Water Works Associations Water
Audits and Loss Control Programs, Manual M36 and its associated Free Water
Audit Software.  The regulations would include a requirement to notify the
water purveyors customers of the water loss reported in the water audit on or
with the water purveyors next annual consumer confidence report or on or with
the next bill the customer receives after the water audit is submitted.  In
addition, public water utilities regulated by the Board of Public Utilities
would be required to provide the board with a completed and validated water
loss audit.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the DEP
to adopt, no sooner than 36 months and no later than 48 months after the date
of enactment of the bill into law, regulations:  (1) specifying a minimum data
validity score or a specific level of yearly improvement in the data validity
score of future annual water loss audit reports; and (2) setting forth
performance standards to be met by a water purveyor concerning the volume of water
losses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires the DEP, in
consultation with the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, to establish, in each of
the two fiscal years beginning after the date of enactment of the bill, a grant
program to assist water purveyors in procuring water loss audit report
validation under the bill, within the limits of funds appropriated or made
available to the DEP.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill also requires the DEP
to provide technical assistance to water purveyors concerning:  (1) the
American Water Works Associations Water Audits and Loss Control Programs,
Manual M36 methodology, data tracking, and use of the associated Free Water
Audit Software; and (2) available water loss reduction programs, including, but
not limited to, metering techniques including testing, repair, and replacement,
pressure management techniques, condition-based assessment techniques for
transmission and distribution pipelines, and active leak detection.  The DEP
would establish a technical advisory committee to assist with the
implementation of the bill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The bill requires a water
purveyor that is subject to the requirements of the Water Quality
Accountability Act, P.L.2017, c.133 (C.58:31-1 et seq.), to consider the
findings of its annual water loss audit reports when determining which projects
would receive highest priority in its asset management plan required pursuant
to the Water Quality Accountability Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Lastly, the bill updates the
definition section and makes other technical amendments to the Water Supply
Management Act.</p>
