If the government record 2in a complete and unabridged form2 is readily available on a public agencys website, the custodian may require the requestor to obtain the record from the website, which shall contain a search bar feature on its home page.  The custodian shall provide the requestor with directions to assist in finding the record on the website, including providing the website URL address and the location on the website of the search bar, menu button, tab, link, landing page or equivalent, which contains the requested record.  1[The request shall be deemed fulfilled upon notification by the custodian to the requestor of the availability and location on the website of the requested information.]  If the requestor does not respond to the custodian within seven 2business2 days of the custodian providing information about a record on the public agencys website, the request shall be deemed fulfilled 2unless the version of the government record on the public agencys website fails to contain non-protected information contained in the original record, in which case the custodian shall produce the original version of the record subject to any redactions required by law2.  If, after the custodian has provided instructions on how to find a record on a public agencys website, the requestor is unable to find the record upon making a good faith effort to locate the record on the website, the requestor shall notify the custodian within seven 2business2 days of the custodian providing the information.  Upon receiving such a request for assistance from a requestor, the custodian shall make a reasonable attempt to assist the requestor in finding the record on the website within seven 2business2 days of the requestor notifying the custodian.1  2If the requestor is still unable to locate the record and requests a physical copy, the custodian shall provide the requestor with a physical copy of the record, for a fee not exceeding two times the cost of the production of the document.  The custodian shall provide the requestor with the physical copy of the record within seven business days of the request for a physical copy.2 f.    The custodian of a public agency shall adopt 2[a] the2 form 2established by the Government Records Council pursuant to subsection b. of section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7),2 for the use of any person who requests access to a government record held or controlled by the public agency.  The form shall provide space for the name, address, email address and [phone] telephone number of the requestor and a brief description of the government record sought.  A request shall be submitted by a requestor in the form adopted by the custodian and the custodian may deny a request that is 2[not submitted in the form adopted by the custodian] incomplete, except that a requestor indicating the request is being submitted anonymously shall not be grounds for denial.  A completed form adopted by the custodian, a letter, or an email from a requestor including all of the information required on the adopted form shall suffice in place of a completed form as a valid government record request.  If the letter or email from a requestor includes substantially more information than required on the adopted form and requires more than reasonable effort to clarify the information, the custodian may deny the request.  If a letter or an email from a requestor does not include all of the information required on the adopted form, the custodian may deny the record request2 .  A request may be submitted anonymously provided, however, that anonymous requestors shall not be permitted to institute proceedings pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).  2A request that is submitted anonymously shall not be considered incomplete.2 The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify whether the government record will be used by that requestor or another person for a commercial purpose, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. 2[All requests by a data broker or a requestor who is making a request on behalf of and for the use of a data broker shall be denied.  The form also shall include space for a requestor to certify that the requestor is not a data broker or is not making the request on behalf of or for the use of a data broker, and the requestor shall be required to provide this information for the request to be fulfilled. Data obtained through a records request shall not be sold.]2 The form shall include space for the custodian to indicate which record will be made available, when the record will be available, and the fees to be charged. The form shall also include the following: (1) specific directions and procedures for requesting a record; (2) a statement as to whether prepayment of fees or a deposit is required; (3) the time period within which the public agency is required by P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, to make the record available; (4) a statement of the requestor's right to challenge a decision by the public agency to deny access and the procedure for filing an appeal; (5) space for the custodian to list reasons if a request is denied in whole or in part; (6) space for the requestor to sign and date the form; (7) space for the custodian to sign and date the form if the request is fulfilled or denied.  The custodian may require a deposit against costs for reproducing documents sought through [an anonymous] a request whenever the custodian anticipates that the information thus requested will cost in excess of $5 to reproduce. Custodians 2who have adopted electronic government record request forms2 shall provide directions on how to submit requests for government records, including any required forms, on the public agencys website. Custodians shall be permitted to provide an electronic response to any electronic records request if government records are available electronically. g.   A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A public agency may make available to the public on its website an online form, portal, or software for transmitting requests electronically.  2The form established by the Government Records Council, pursuant to subsection b. of section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7), may be submitted electronically or by fax.  Each submission of a government record request form or an email record request shall be made to the custodian of not more than one public agency.  Submission of repeated requests to multiple custodians in the same public agency for the same record, while an identical or substantially similar request is pending in the agency, shall permit the custodian to deny the request.2 A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  [If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.]  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after 2informing the requestor of the potential disruption to agency operations and2 attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. A party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order 2[in the legal proceeding or if compliance would otherwise be unreasonable, oppressive, or duplicative of already pending discovery request made in that legal proceeding] including a pending discovery request2 , and a custodian shall not be required to complete such a request.  The requestor shall be required to certify whether the government record is being sought in connection with a legal proceeding and identify the proceeding for the request to be fulfilled.  For purposes of this provision, a party to a legal proceeding shall include a party 2[in interest] subject to a court order2 , any attorney representing that party, and any person acting as an agent for or on behalf of that party.  2Nothing in this paragraph shall bar a request for a government record filed by a labor organization or by a contractor signatory to a collective bargaining agreement seeking information material to the enforcement of State or federal statutes or regulations regarding but not limited to wage and hour protections, workplace safety, or public procurement and public bidding, including, but not limited to, requests for certified payrolls or information about all bids submitted in response to a public procurement process subsequent to the deadline for the submission of all bids for that solicitation, when the request by the labor organization or contractor signatory is not sought in connection with or in furtherance of discovery requests in a court proceeding.2 A custodian shall not be required to complete a request including for, but not limited to, mail, email, text messages, correspondence, or social media postings and messages, if the request does not identify 2a2 specific 2[individuals or] job title or2 accounts to be searched 2, a specific subject matter,2 and is not confined to a 2[discrete and limited] reasonable2 time period 2[and a specific subject matter]2 , or if the custodian determines that the request would require research and the collection of information from the contents of government records and the creation of new government records setting forth that research and information.  2It shall be sufficient for a requestor to identify specific individuals by the individuals job title and position.2 h.   Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record.  The request shall not be considered submitted until it is received by the custodian of records. i.    (1) Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, or 14 business days if the request is for a commercial purpose or if the records have to be reviewed by the public agency for the purpose of the agencys compliance with P.L.2021, c.371 (C.47:1B-1 et seq.), but the custodian shall notify the requestor of the additional response time within seven business days, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  The response time periods of seven or 14 business days, as established in this subsection, shall be an additional seven business days longer if the public agency is a fire district which employs one or fewer full-time employees who serve as custodians.  2If a commercial requestor would like to receive the record within seven business days, as established in this subsection, the custodian shall provide the requestor with a copy of the record and may charge a special service fee not exceeding two times the cost of the production of the record.2 In the event a records custodian is unable to fulfill a records request due to unforeseen circumstances or circumstances that otherwise reasonably necessitate additional time to fulfill the records request, the custodian shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of any response deadline and shall notify the requestor of the time extension within seven business days after receiving the request. In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number [, or other means of contacting the requestor].  If the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number, [or other means of contacting the requestor,] the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor [reappears before] contacts the custodian seeking a response to the original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven or 14 business days, as appropriate, after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available, which shall be no more than 21 business days from the date the requestor is so advised.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied. A public agency shall not be considered to be in possession of a public record that is created 2[or] ,2 maintained 2, or received2 by another public agency and made available to the public agency either by remote access to a computer network or by distribution as a courtesy copy 2, unless the agency that created, maintained, or received the record resides within the judicial branch of the State Government2 .  A records custodian of a public agency that receives a request for 2[such]2 a record 2created, maintained, or received by another public agency2 , shall not be obligated to provide the record to the requestor 2[and] .  In the event the custodian does not provide the record, the custodian2 shall direct the requestor within seven business days to the public agency that, to the best of their knowledge, created 2[or],2 maintains 2, or received2 the requested record, at which time the request shall be considered completed. The custodian shall not be required to complete an identical request for access to a government record from the same requestor if the information has not changed.  2Nothing in this section shall prevent a requestor from filing periodic requests regarding regularly updated public records, including, but not limited to, certified payrolls, permits, and licensing applications.2 A requestor shall have 14 business days to retrieve the government records following notice from the custodian that the request has been completed and the records are available. (2)  During a period declared pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for access to a government record within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, or as soon as possible thereafter. j.    A custodian shall [post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the] include information on the public agencys website and public records request form regarding a requestors right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record [by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof] and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed, which shall include the website address and toll-free information line phone number of the Government Records Council. k.   The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2023, c.113, s.2) 2[4.] 3.2    Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.   A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor who is accurately identified by name, may, within 45 days of the date of denial: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodians decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judges knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or [agency head] Government Records Council shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding [shall] may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.  2[In determining whether to award attorneys fees, the court or the Government Records Council may consider whether the public agency is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or to have unreasonably denied access.]  While the court or Government Records Council may award a reasonable attorneys fee to a prevailing party in any proceeding, if the public agency has been determined to have unreasonably denied access, acted in bad faith, or knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), then the court or Government Records Council shall award a reasonable attorneys fee.2 If the records sought are produced by the public agency within seven business days of service of an action in Superior Court or a complaint before the Government Records Council, 1upon notification to the Superior Court or the Government Records Council,1 the matter shall be dismissed without prejudice and the requestor may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee if the custodian knew or should have known that the denial of access violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 2[5.] 4.2    Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8. a.  (1)  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, [the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor]  who shall serve as Chair, and eight public members appointed as follows: four appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate 2, no more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party2 ; two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the President of the Senate 2, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party2 ; and two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the Speaker of the General Assembly 2, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party2.  Each public member shall serve for a term of five years and until a successor is appointed and qualified. (2) Notwithstanding 2[any provision of subsection a. (1) of this section] the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection2 , or any other law, rule, or regulation to the contrary, within 90 days following the enactment date of P.L.    , c.

(3) A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected [or appointed] office [or employment] while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall [not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act] receive a salary equivalent to that provided by law for a public member of the Local Finance Board of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled [in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.] by appointment by the Governor, according to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, and for the remainder of the unexpired term.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.   The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; 2promulgate rules and regulations to establish a uniform government record request form for all government record requests permitted for use by any public agency, that includes the required form components as set forth in subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5).  The form shall include certification that a party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order or a pending discovery request.  The council shall make the form available electronically and in print and shall make the form available to incarcerated individuals;2 and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied[;] .

The public agency that employs the records custodian shall have the opportunity to present the board with any statement or information concerning the complaint which the [custodian] agency wishes.  If the council is able to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the public agency that employs the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  If the council is unable to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, the council shall conduct a hearing on the matter in conformity with the rules and regulations provided for hearings by a State agency in contested cases under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), insofar as they may be applicable and practicable. The council shall, by a majority vote of its members, render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented.  If the council determines, by a majority vote of its members, that a custodian [has] is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and [is found] to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the council may impose the penalties provided for in section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11) on the public agency that employs the custodian. A decision of the council may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  Such appeals shall be filed within 2[30] 452 days from the date the council renders a decision.  A decision of the council shall not have value as a precedent for any case initiated in Superior Court pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).  All proceedings of the council pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Beginning 18 months following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the council shall adjudicate all complaints that come before it within 90 days of the complaints filing, with the ability to extend for 2[30] 452 days for good cause, exclusive of any time period during which the parties are engaged in a mediation process pursuant to this section.  The council shall make such organizational adjustments and modify its procedures as it deems necessary to ensure that complaints are adjudicated in such a timeframe. f.    The council shall not charge any party a fee in regard to actions filed with the council.  The council shall be subject to the provisions of the "Open Public Meetings Act," P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6), except that the council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.  [A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.] 2A requestor who prevails in any proceeding may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee as provided for in section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).2 g.   The council shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial or Legislative Branches of State Government or any agency, officer, or employee of those branches. 2h.  The Superior Court shall provide the Government Records Council a list of all actions which have been brought before the courts filed pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the open public records act, which have been settled by the parties thereto.  Such a list shall provide the docket number and names of the parties to the action.

Custodians 2who have adopted electronic government record request forms2 shall provide directions on how to submit requests for government records, including any required forms, on the public agencys website. Custodians shall be permitted to provide an electronic response to any electronic records request if government records are available electronically. g.   A request for access to a government record shall be in writing and hand-delivered, mailed, transmitted electronically, or otherwise conveyed to the appropriate custodian.  A public agency may make available to the public on its website an online form, portal, or software for transmitting requests electronically.  2The form established by the Government Records Council, pursuant to subsection b. of section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7), may be submitted electronically or by fax.  Each submission of a government record request form or an email record request shall be made to the custodian of not more than one public agency.  Submission of repeated requests to multiple custodians in the same public agency for the same record, while an identical or substantially similar request is pending in the agency, shall permit the custodian to deny the request.2 A custodian shall promptly comply with a request to inspect, examine, copy, or provide a copy of a government record.  If the custodian is unable to comply with a request for access, the custodian shall indicate the specific basis therefor on the request form and promptly return it to the requestor.  The custodian shall sign and date the form and provide the requestor with a copy thereof.  If the custodian of a government record asserts that part of a particular record is exempt from public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented, the custodian shall delete or excise from a copy of the record that portion which the custodian asserts is exempt from access and shall promptly permit access to the remainder of the record.  [If the government record requested is temporarily unavailable because it is in use or in storage, the custodian shall so advise the requestor and shall make arrangements to promptly make available a copy of the record.]  If a request for access to a government record would substantially disrupt agency operations, the custodian may deny access to the record after 2informing the requestor of the potential disruption to agency operations and2 attempting to reach a reasonable solution with the requestor that accommodates the interests of the requestor and the agency. A party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order 2[in the legal proceeding or if compliance would otherwise be unreasonable, oppressive, or duplicative of already pending discovery request made in that legal proceeding] including a pending discovery request2 , and a custodian shall not be required to complete such a request.  The requestor shall be required to certify whether the government record is being sought in connection with a legal proceeding and identify the proceeding for the request to be fulfilled.  For purposes of this provision, a party to a legal proceeding shall include a party 2[in interest] subject to a court order2 , any attorney representing that party, and any person acting as an agent for or on behalf of that party.  2Nothing in this paragraph shall bar a request for a government record filed by a labor organization or by a contractor signatory to a collective bargaining agreement seeking information material to the enforcement of State or federal statutes or regulations regarding but not limited to wage and hour protections, workplace safety, or public procurement and public bidding, including, but not limited to, requests for certified payrolls or information about all bids submitted in response to a public procurement process subsequent to the deadline for the submission of all bids for that solicitation, when the request by the labor organization or contractor signatory is not sought in connection with or in furtherance of discovery requests in a court proceeding.2 A custodian shall not be required to complete a request including for, but not limited to, mail, email, text messages, correspondence, or social media postings and messages, if the request does not identify 2a2 specific 2[individuals or] job title or2 accounts to be searched 2, a specific subject matter,2 and is not confined to a 2[discrete and limited] reasonable2 time period 2[and a specific subject matter]2 , or if the custodian determines that the request would require research and the collection of information from the contents of government records and the creation of new government records setting forth that research and information.  2It shall be sufficient for a requestor to identify specific individuals by the individuals job title and position.2 h.   Any officer or employee of a public agency who receives a request for access to a government record shall forward the request to the custodian of the record or direct the requestor to the custodian of the record.  The request shall not be considered submitted until it is received by the custodian of records. i.    (1) Unless a shorter time period is otherwise provided by statute, regulation, or executive order, a custodian of a government record shall grant access to a government record or deny a request for access to a government record as soon as possible, but not later than seven business days after receiving the request, or 14 business days if the request is for a commercial purpose or if the records have to be reviewed by the public agency for the purpose of the agencys compliance with P.L.2021, c.371 (C.47:1B-1 et seq.), but the custodian shall notify the requestor of the additional response time within seven business days, provided that the record is currently available and not in storage or archived.  The response time periods of seven or 14 business days, as established in this subsection, shall be an additional seven business days longer if the public agency is a fire district which employs one or fewer full-time employees who serve as custodians.  2If a commercial requestor would like to receive the record within seven business days, as established in this subsection, the custodian shall provide the requestor with a copy of the record and may charge a special service fee not exceeding two times the cost of the production of the record.2 In the event a records custodian is unable to fulfill a records request due to unforeseen circumstances or circumstances that otherwise reasonably necessitate additional time to fulfill the records request, the custodian shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of any response deadline and shall notify the requestor of the time extension within seven business days after receiving the request. In the event a custodian fails to respond within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, after receiving a request, the failure to respond shall be deemed a denial of the request, unless the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number [, or other means of contacting the requestor].  If the requestor has elected not to accurately identify themselves or to provide [a name,] an accurate address, email address, or telephone number, [or other means of contacting the requestor,] the custodian shall not be required to respond until the requestor [reappears before] contacts the custodian seeking a response to the original request. If the government record is in storage or archived, the requestor shall be so advised within seven or 14 business days, as appropriate, after the custodian receives the request.  The requestor shall be advised by the custodian when the record can be made available, which shall be no more than 21 business days from the date the requestor is so advised.  If the record is not made available by that time, access shall be deemed denied. A public agency shall not be considered to be in possession of a public record that is created 2[or] ,2 maintained 2, or received2 by another public agency and made available to the public agency either by remote access to a computer network or by distribution as a courtesy copy 2, unless the agency that created, maintained, or received the record resides within the judicial branch of the State Government2 .  A records custodian of a public agency that receives a request for 2[such]2 a record 2created, maintained, or received by another public agency2 , shall not be obligated to provide the record to the requestor 2[and] .  In the event the custodian does not provide the record, the custodian2 shall direct the requestor within seven business days to the public agency that, to the best of their knowledge, created 2[or],2 maintains 2, or received2 the requested record, at which time the request shall be considered completed. The custodian shall not be required to complete an identical request for access to a government record from the same requestor if the information has not changed.  2Nothing in this section shall prevent a requestor from filing periodic requests regarding regularly updated public records, including, but not limited to, certified payrolls, permits, and licensing applications.2 A requestor shall have 14 business days to retrieve the government records following notice from the custodian that the request has been completed and the records are available. (2)  During a period declared pursuant to the laws of this State as a state of emergency, public health emergency, or state of local disaster emergency, the deadlines by which to respond to a request for, or grant or deny access to, a government record under paragraph (1) of this subsection or subsection e. of this section shall not apply, provided, however, that the custodian of a government record shall make a reasonable effort, as the circumstances permit, to respond to a request for access to a government record within seven business days or 14 business days, as appropriate, or as soon as possible thereafter. j.    A custodian shall [post prominently in public view in the part or parts of the office or offices of the custodian that are open to or frequented by the public a statement that sets forth in clear, concise and specific terms the] include information on the public agencys website and public records request form regarding a requestors right to appeal a denial of, or failure to provide, access to a government record [by any person for inspection, examination, or copying or for purchase of copies thereof] and the procedure by which an appeal may be filed, which shall include the website address and toll-free information line phone number of the Government Records Council. k.   The files maintained by the Office of the Public Defender that relate to the handling of any case shall be considered confidential and shall not be open to inspection by any person unless authorized by law, court order, or the State Public Defender. (cf: P.L.2023, c.113, s.2) 2[4.] 3.2    Section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6) is amended to read as follows: 7.   A person who is denied access to a government record by the custodian of the record, at the option of the requestor who is accurately identified by name, may, within 45 days of the date of denial: institute a proceeding to challenge the custodians decision by filing an action in Superior Court which shall be heard in the vicinage where it is filed by a Superior Court Judge who has been designated to hear such cases because of that judges knowledge and expertise in matters relating to access to government records; or in lieu of filing an action in Superior Court, file a complaint with the Government Records Council established pursuant to section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7). The right to institute any proceeding under this section shall be solely that of the requestor.  Any such proceeding shall proceed in a summary or expedited manner. The public agency shall have the burden of proving that the denial of access is authorized by law.  If it is determined that access has been improperly denied, the court or [agency head] Government Records Council shall order that access be allowed.  A requestor who prevails in any proceeding [shall] may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.  2[In determining whether to award attorneys fees, the court or the Government Records Council may consider whether the public agency is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), or to have unreasonably denied access.]  While the court or Government Records Council may award a reasonable attorneys fee to a prevailing party in any proceeding, if the public agency has been determined to have unreasonably denied access, acted in bad faith, or knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), then the court or Government Records Council shall award a reasonable attorneys fee.2 If the records sought are produced by the public agency within seven business days of service of an action in Superior Court or a complaint before the Government Records Council, 1upon notification to the Superior Court or the Government Records Council,1 the matter shall be dismissed without prejudice and the requestor may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee if the custodian knew or should have known that the denial of access violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.). (cf: P.L.2001, c.404, s.7) 2[5.] 4.2    Section 8 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-7) is amended to read as follows: 8. a.  (1)  There is established in the Department of Community Affairs a Government Records Council.  The council shall consist of the Commissioner of Community Affairs or the commissioner's designee, [the Commissioner of Education or the commissioner's designee, and three public members appointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of the same political party.  The three public members shall serve during the term of the Governor making the appointment and until the appointment of a successor]  who shall serve as Chair, and eight public members appointed as follows: four appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate 2, no more than two of whom shall be members of the same political party2 ; two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the President of the Senate 2, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party2 ; and two directly appointed by the Governor from persons recommended by the Speaker of the General Assembly 2, no more than one of whom shall be a member of the same political party2.  Each public member shall serve for a term of five years and until a successor is appointed and qualified. (2) Notwithstanding 2[any provision of subsection a.

(3) A public member shall not hold any other State or local elected [or appointed] office [or employment] while serving as a member of the council.  A public member shall [not receive a salary for service on the council but shall be reimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses associated with serving on the council and may receive such per diem payment as may be provided in the annual appropriations act] receive a salary equivalent to that provided by law for a public member of the Local Finance Board of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.  A member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Vacancies among the public members shall be filled [in the same manner in which the original appointment was made.  The members of the council shall choose one of the public members to serve as the council's chair.] by appointment by the Governor, according to the provisions of subsection a. of this section, and for the remainder of the unexpired term.  The council may employ an executive director and such professional and clerical staff as it deems necessary and may call upon the Department of Community Affairs for such assistance as it deems necessary and may be available to it. b.   The Government Records Council shall: establish an informal mediation program to facilitate the resolution of disputes regarding access to government records; receive, hear, review and adjudicate a complaint filed by any person concerning a denial of access to a government record by a records custodian; issue advisory opinions, on its own initiative, as to whether a particular type of record is a government record which is accessible to the public; prepare guidelines and an informational pamphlet for use by records custodians in complying with the law governing access to public records; prepare an informational pamphlet explaining the public's right of access to government records and the methods for resolving disputes regarding access, which records custodians shall make available to persons requesting access to a government record; prepare lists for use by records custodians of the types of records in the possession of public agencies which are government records; make training opportunities available for records custodians and other public officers and employees which explain the law governing access to public records; 2promulgate rules and regulations to establish a uniform government record request form for all government record requests permitted for use by any public agency, that includes the required form components as set forth in subsection f. of section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-5).  The form shall include certification that a party to a legal proceeding may not request a government record if the record sought is the subject of a court order or a pending discovery request.  The council shall make the form available electronically and in print and shall make the form available to incarcerated individuals;2 and operate an informational website and a toll-free helpline staffed by knowledgeable employees of the council during regular business hours which shall enable any person, including records custodians, to call for information regarding the law governing access to public records and allow any person to request mediation or to file a complaint with the council when access has been denied[;] .

The public agency that employs the records custodian shall have the opportunity to present the board with any statement or information concerning the complaint which the [custodian] agency wishes.  If the council is able to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, it shall reduce that conclusion to writing and transmit a copy thereof to the complainant and to the public agency that employs the records custodian against whom the complaint was filed.  If the council is unable to make a determination as to a record's accessibility based upon the complaint and the [custodian's] agencys response thereto, the council shall conduct a hearing on the matter in conformity with the rules and regulations provided for hearings by a State agency in contested cases under the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), insofar as they may be applicable and practicable. The council shall, by a majority vote of its members, render a decision as to whether the record which is the subject of the complaint is a government record which must be made available for public access pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.) as amended and supplemented.  If the council determines, by a majority vote of its members, that a custodian [has] is found to have knowingly and willfully violated P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), as amended and supplemented, and [is found] to have unreasonably denied access under the totality of the circumstances, the council may impose the penalties provided for in section 12 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-11) on the public agency that employs the custodian. A decision of the council may be appealed to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court.  Such appeals shall be filed within 2[30] 452 days from the date the council renders a decision.  A decision of the council shall not have value as a precedent for any case initiated in Superior Court pursuant to section 7 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).  All proceedings of the council pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Beginning 18 months following the effective date of P.L.    , c.    (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the council shall adjudicate all complaints that come before it within 90 days of the complaints filing, with the ability to extend for 2[30] 452 days for good cause, exclusive of any time period during which the parties are engaged in a mediation process pursuant to this section.  The council shall make such organizational adjustments and modify its procedures as it deems necessary to ensure that complaints are adjudicated in such a timeframe. f.    The council shall not charge any party a fee in regard to actions filed with the council.  The council shall be subject to the provisions of the "Open Public Meetings Act," P.L.1975, c.231 (C.10:4-6), except that the council may go into closed session during that portion of any proceeding during which the contents of a contested record would be disclosed.  [A requestor who prevails in any proceeding shall be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee.] 2A requestor who prevails in any proceeding may be entitled to a reasonable attorneys fee as provided for in section 6 of P.L.2001, c.404 (C.47:1A-6).2 g.   The council shall not have jurisdiction over the Judicial or Legislative Branches of State Government or any agency, officer, or employee of those branches. 2h.  The Superior Court shall provide the Government Records Council a list of all actions which have been brought before the courts filed pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), commonly known as the open public records act, which have been settled by the parties thereto.  Such a list shall provide the docket number and names of the parties to the action.
