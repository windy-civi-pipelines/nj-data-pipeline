CURRENT VERSION OF TEXT Introduced Pending Technical Review by Legislative Counsel. An Act concerning Medicaid reimbursement for private duty nursing services and supplementing Title 30 of the Revised Statutes. Be It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey: 1.    The hourly reimbursement rate for private duty nursing services under the Medicaid program established pursuant to P.L.1968, c.413 (C.30:4D-1 et seq.), regardless of whether the services are provided in the Medicaid fee-for-service delivery system or in the managed care delivery system, shall be no less than $65 per hour when a registered professional nurse provides the services, and no less than $53 per hour when a licensed practical nurse provides the services. 2.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act and secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program. 3.    The Commissioner of Human Services shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), to effectuate the purposes of this act. 4.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill would increase the Medicaid reimbursement rates for private duty nursing (PDN) services by $4. PDN services are individualized nursing services that are provided by licensed nurses, on a continuous and non-intermittent basis, to certain beneficiaries in the home setting.  Under the State FY 2023 Appropriations Act, the current Medicaid reimbursement rate for PDN services is $61 per hour when the services are provided by a registered nurse and $49 per hour when the services are provided by a licensed practical nurse.  These rates supersede the rates established under current Department of Human Services regulations, which establish a rate of $60 for PDN services provided by a registered nurse and a rate of $48 for services provided by a licensed practical nurse. The bill increases the Medicaid reimbursement rate for PDN services to at least $65 per hour when provided by a registered professional nurse and to at least $53 per hour when provided by a licensed practical nurse.  The increased reimbursement rate will apply regardless of whether services are provided under the fee for service delivery system or the managed care delivery system. The bill requires the Commissioner of Human Services to apply for such State plan amendments or waivers as may be necessary to implement the provisions of the bill and secure federal financial participation for State Medicaid expenditures under the federal Medicaid program.
