Applications to the authority for eligibility under the program pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection shall be completed by December 31, 2013.  Submission of a proposal to the federal government prior to authority approval shall not disqualify a business from the program. g.    Nothing shall preclude a business from applying for tax credits under the program for more than one project pursuant to one or more applications. h.    A business shall not be required to purchase pinelands development credits under the "Pinelands Protection Act," P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), the pinelands comprehensive management plan, or any other rule or regulation adopted pursuant to that act in connection with any approval or relief obtained related to a qualified business facility located in an aviation district on or after the effective date of P.L.2018, c.120, except if seeking to develop in permanently protected open space pursuant to the Pinelands Protection Act.

all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the business's current in-State locations; and all lease agreements, ownership documents, or substantially similar documentation for the potential out-of-State location alternatives, to the extent they exist.  Based on this information, and any other information deemed relevant by the authority, the authority shall independently verify and confirm, by way of making a factual finding by separate vote of the authority's board, the business's assertion that the jobs are actually at risk of leaving the State, and as to the date or dates at which the authority expects that those jobs would actually leave the State, or, with respect to projects located in a Garden State Growth Zone that qualifies under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or projects located in a Garden State Growth Zone which contains a Tourism District as established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2011, c.18 (C.5:12-219) and regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, the business's assertion that the provision of tax credits under the program is a material factor in the business's decision to make a capital investment and locate in a Garden State Growth Zone that qualifies under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or in a Garden State Growth Zone which contains a Tourism District as established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2011, c.18 (C.5:12-219) and regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, before a business may be awarded any tax credits under this section. e.     A project that consists solely of point-of-final-purchase retail facilities shall not be eligible for a grant of tax credits.  If a project consists of both point-of-final-purchase retail facilities and non-retail facilities, only the portion of the project consisting of non-retail facilities shall be eligible for a grant of tax credits.  For a qualified business facility that is a mixed-use project that includes retail facilities and that is located in a Garden State Growth Zone or the Atlantic City Tourism District as established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2011, c.18 (C.5:12-219) and regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, retail facilities in an amount up to 7.5 percent of the mixed-use project may be included in the mixed-use project application for a grant of tax credits along with the non-retail facilities, and that application may include in the aggregate the pro-rata number of full-time employees employed by any number of tenants or other occupants of the included retail facilities.  If a warehouse facility is part of a point-of-final-purchase retail facility and supplies only that facility, the warehouse facility shall not be eligible for a grant of tax credits.  For the purposes of this section, a retail facility of at least 150,000 square feet, of which at least 50 percent is occupied by a full-service supermarket or grocery store, located in a Garden State Growth Zone which qualified under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or a tourism destination project in the Atlantic City Tourism District as established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2011, c.18 (C.5:12-219), or catalog distribution centers shall not be considered point-of-final-purchase retail facilities. f.     The authority may determine as eligible for tax credits under the program any business that is required to respond to a request for proposals and to fulfill a contract with the federal government although the business's chief executive officer or equivalent officer has not demonstrated to the authority that the award of tax credits will be a material factor in the business's decision to retain the minimum number of retained full-time jobs, as otherwise required by this section.  The authority may, in its discretion, consider the economic benefit of the retained jobs servicing the contract in conducting a net benefit analysis required by paragraph (4) of subsection a. of this section.  For the purposes of this subsection, "retained full-time jobs" includes jobs that are at risk of being eliminated. Applications to the authority for eligibility under the program pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection shall be completed by December 31, 2013.  Submission of a proposal to the federal government prior to authority approval shall not disqualify a business from the program. g.    Nothing shall preclude a business from applying for tax credits under the program for more than one project pursuant to one or more applications. (cf: P.L.2018, c.120, s.2) 6.    Section 5 of P.L.2011, c.149 (C.34:1B-246) is amended to read as follows: 5.  a.  The total amount of the tax credit for an eligible business for each new or retained full-time job shall be as set forth in subsections b. through f. of this section.  The total tax credit amount shall be calculated and credited to the business annually for each year of the eligibility period. Notwithstanding any other provisions of P.L.2013, c.161 (C.52:27D-489p et al.), a business may assign its ability to apply for the tax credit under this subsection to a non-profit organization with a mission dedicated to attracting investment and completing development and redevelopment projects in a Garden State Growth Zone.  The non-profit organization or organization operating a qualified incubator facility may make an application on behalf of a business which meets the requirements for the tax credit, or a group of non-qualifying businesses or positions, located at a qualified business facility, that shall be considered a unified project for the purposes of the incentives provided under this section.  For any project located in a Garden State Growth Zone that qualifies under the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act," P.L.2002, c.43 (C.52:27BBB-1 et al.), or any project located in a Garden State Growth Zone which contains a Tourism District as established pursuant to section 5 of P.L.2011, c.18 (C.5:12-219) and regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, and which will include a retail facility of at least 150,000 square feet, of which at least 50 percent will be occupied by either a full-service supermarket or grocery store, a business may assign its ability to apply for the tax credit under this subsection to the developer of the facility.  The developer may make an application on behalf of the business which meets the requirements for the tax credit, or a group of non-qualifying businesses located at the business facility, that shall be considered a unified project for the purposes of the incentives provided under this section, and the developer may apply for tax credits available based on the number of jobs provided by the business or businesses and the total capital investment of the business or businesses and the developer. b.    The base amount of the tax credit for each new or retained full-time job shall be as follows: (1)   (a)  for a qualified business facility located within an urban transit hub municipality, located within a Garden State Growth Zone, or which is a mega project, $5,000 per year;

(cf: P.L.2017, c.221, s.2) 7.    Section 23 of P.L.2004, c.65 (C.52:27H-87.1) is amended to read as follows: 23.  a.  Retail sales of energy and utility service to: (1)   a qualified business that employs at least [250] 188 people within an enterprise zone, at least [50%] 33 percent of whom are directly employed in a manufacturing process, for the exclusive use or consumption of such business within an enterprise zone, and (2)   a group of two or more persons: (a) each of which is a qualified business that are all located within a single redevelopment area adopted pursuant to the "Local Redevelopment and Housing Law," P.L.1992, c.79 (C.40A:12A-1 et al.); (b) that collectively employ at least [250] 188 people within an enterprise zone, at least [50%] 33 percent of whom are directly employed in a manufacturing process; (c) are each engaged in a vertically integrated business, evidenced by the manufacture and distribution of a product or family of products that, when taken together, are primarily used, packaged and sold as a single product; and (d) collectively use the energy and utility service for the exclusive use or consumption of each of the persons that comprise a group within an enterprise zone; are exempt from the taxes imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.). A qualified business will continue to be subject to applicable Board of Public Utilities tariff regulations except that its bills from utility companies and third party suppliers for energy and utility service shall not include charges for sales and use tax. b.    A business that meets the requirements of subsection a. of this section shall not be allowed the exemption granted pursuant to this section until it has complied with such requirements for obtaining the exemption as may be provided pursuant to P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et al.) and P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.). The Executive  Director of the New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority shall provide prompt notice to the President of the Board of Public Utilities and to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, of a qualified business that has qualified for the exemption under this subsection, and shall provide the president and the director an annual list of all businesses that qualify. c.     (1)  Retail sales of energy and utility service to a business facility located within a county that is designated for the [50%] 50 percent tax exemption under section 1 of P.L.1993, c.373 (C.54:32B-8.45) are exempt from the taxes imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.); provided that the business certifies that it employs at least [50] 38 people at that facility, at least [50%] 33 percent of whom are directly employed in a manufacturing process, and provided that the energy and utility services are consumed exclusively at that facility. (2)   A business facility that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection may file an application for the energy and utility service sales tax exemption with the New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority, and the commission shall promulgate regulations and forms for that purpose.  The New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority shall process an application submitted under this paragraph within 20 business days of receipt thereof.  An exemption shall commence for a business upon notice of approval of its application and shall expire for any year in which the business fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection.  Upon approval, the Executive Director of the New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority shall provide prompt notice to the applicant and also shall provide prompt notice to the President of the Board of Public Utilities and to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury.  The Executive Director of the New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority also shall provide the president and the director with an annual list of all businesses that have been approved under this subsection. (cf: P.L.2007, c.253, s.41) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reduces by 50 percent, the number of manufacturing jobs required to be eligible for New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) financing and incentive programs. The sales and use tax exemption program permits certain companies to obtain a sales tax exemption certificate for the purchase of items to construct or rehabilitate a new business location.  Under the bill, a life science or manufacturing company relocating 125 full-time manufacturing jobs or 250 full-time non-manufacturing jobs may be eligible for the exemption.  The program currently requires the relocation of 250 full-time employees regardless of whether the job is a manufacturing job or not. The GROW NJ program provides tax credits to eligible businesses based upon defined job creation and capital investment criteria.  Under the bill, the number of full-time jobs that must be created or retained to qualify for the GROW program is reduced by 50 percent for manufacturing jobs, but remains the same for non-manufacturing jobs.  The definition of a mega project is altered so that the number of jobs that must be created to qualify as a mega project is reduced by 50 percent for manufacturing jobs, but remains the same for non-manufacturing jobs.  The alternate benefit calculation for a GROW project in a Garden State Growth Zone which qualifies for the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act, divides the total capital investment by the number of jobs to be created, with the number of full-time manufacturing jobs used in this calculation being reduced by 50 percent for each investment and job creation category used to make the calculation. The Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZ) manufacturers energy sales tax exemption allows UEZ certified manufacturers an exemption from the sales and use tax on electricity and natural gas and its transmission consumed at the UEZ certified location.  Under the bill, the employment requirement for a business is reduced from 250 full-time employees, with at least 50 percent being involved in the manufacturing process to 188 full-time employees with at least 33 percent being involved in the manufacturing process.

Applications to the authority for eligibility under the program pursuant to the criteria set forth in this subsection shall be completed by December 31, 2013.  Submission of a proposal to the federal government prior to authority approval shall not disqualify a business from the program. g.    Nothing shall preclude a business from applying for tax credits under the program for more than one project pursuant to one or more applications. h.    A business shall not be required to purchase pinelands development credits under the "Pinelands Protection Act," P.L.1979, c.111 (C.13:18A-1 et seq.), the pinelands comprehensive management plan, or any other rule or regulation adopted pursuant to that act in connection with any approval or relief obtained related to a qualified business facility located in an aviation district on or after the effective date of P.L.2018, c.120, except if seeking to develop in permanently protected open space pursuant to the Pinelands Protection Act.

A qualified business will continue to be subject to applicable Board of Public Utilities tariff regulations except that its bills from utility companies and third party suppliers for energy and utility service shall not include charges for sales and use tax. b.    A business that meets the requirements of subsection a. of this section shall not be allowed the exemption granted pursuant to this section until it has complied with such requirements for obtaining the exemption as may be provided pursuant to P.L.1983, c.303 (C.52:27H-60 et al.) and P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.). The Executive  Director of the New Jersey [Commerce Commission] Economic Development Authority shall provide prompt notice to the President of the Board of Public Utilities and to the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, of a qualified business that has qualified for the exemption under this subsection, and shall provide the president and the director an annual list of all businesses that qualify. c.     (1)  Retail sales of energy and utility service to a business facility located within a county that is designated for the [50%] 50 percent tax exemption under section 1 of P.L.1993, c.373 (C.54:32B-8.45) are exempt from the taxes imposed under the "Sales and Use Tax Act," P.L.1966, c.30 (C.54:32B-1 et seq.); provided that the business certifies that it employs at least [50] 38 people at that facility, at least [50%] 33 percent of whom are directly employed in a manufacturing process, and provided that the energy and utility services are consumed exclusively at that facility.

(cf: P.L.2007, c.253, s.41) 8.    This act shall take effect immediately. STATEMENT This bill reduces by 50 percent, the number of manufacturing jobs required to be eligible for New Jersey Economic Development Authority (EDA) financing and incentive programs. The sales and use tax exemption program permits certain companies to obtain a sales tax exemption certificate for the purchase of items to construct or rehabilitate a new business location.  Under the bill, a life science or manufacturing company relocating 125 full-time manufacturing jobs or 250 full-time non-manufacturing jobs may be eligible for the exemption.  The program currently requires the relocation of 250 full-time employees regardless of whether the job is a manufacturing job or not. The GROW NJ program provides tax credits to eligible businesses based upon defined job creation and capital investment criteria.  Under the bill, the number of full-time jobs that must be created or retained to qualify for the GROW program is reduced by 50 percent for manufacturing jobs, but remains the same for non-manufacturing jobs.  The definition of a mega project is altered so that the number of jobs that must be created to qualify as a mega project is reduced by 50 percent for manufacturing jobs, but remains the same for non-manufacturing jobs.  The alternate benefit calculation for a GROW project in a Garden State Growth Zone which qualifies for the "Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act, divides the total capital investment by the number of jobs to be created, with the number of full-time manufacturing jobs used in this calculation being reduced by 50 percent for each investment and job creation category used to make the calculation. The Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZ) manufacturers energy sales tax exemption allows UEZ certified manufacturers an exemption from the sales and use tax on electricity and natural gas and its transmission consumed at the UEZ certified location.  Under the bill, the employment requirement for a business is reduced from 250 full-time employees, with at least 50 percent being involved in the manufacturing process to 188 full-time employees with at least 33 percent being involved in the manufacturing process.
