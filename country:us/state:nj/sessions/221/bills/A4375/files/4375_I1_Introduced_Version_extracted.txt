Establishes a stipend for council members in an amount to be determined by the coordinator. Provides that all members who have been appointed prior to the enactment of the bill will constitute the inaugural council members, as long as they would also be eligible under the terms of this bill, and will begin their service with the new legislative term commencing on January 9, 2024.
