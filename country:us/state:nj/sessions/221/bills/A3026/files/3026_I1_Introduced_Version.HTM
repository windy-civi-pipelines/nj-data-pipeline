<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 8 of P.L.1975,
c.217 (C.52:27D-126) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     8.    a.   The appointing
authority of any municipality shall appoint a construction official, any
necessary subcode officials and technical assistants to assist such officials
to administer and enforce the code.  The appointing authority may, by resolution
or order as appropriate, set the total number of weekly hours of operation of
the construction official's office and the total number of weekly work hours of
the construction official, commensurate with the compensation paid to the
construction official.  The appointing authority shall not set the specific
work hours of the construction official.  The appointing authority shall also
appoint a construction board of appeals to hear and decide appeals from
decisions made by said construction official and subcode officials, in the
administration and enforcement of the code.  Nothing herein, however, shall
prevent a municipality from accepting inspections as to compliance with the
code or any subcode thereof made by an inspection authority approved by the State
of New Jersey pursuant to law.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    To establish tenure
rights or any other right or protection provided by the &quot;State Uniform
Construction Code Act&quot; or Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey
Statutes, or any pension law or retirement system, the job title
&quot;construction official&quot; shall be equivalent to that job title which,
prior to the adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code as provided in
section 5 of the &quot;State Uniform Construction Code Act,&quot; <u>, P.L.1975,
c.217 (C.52:27D-123),</u> entailed the chief administrative responsibility to
enforce all construction codes which had been adopted by the municipal
governing body, the enforcement of which was not the responsibility of an
authorized private inspection agency; and the job title &quot;subcode official&quot;
shall be equivalent to that job title which, prior to the adoption of the State
Uniform Construction Code, entailed subordinate administrative responsibility
to enforce one or more of the following construction codes: building, plumbing,
electrical or fire code.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any person, in a municipality
operating under Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, who,
prior to the adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code, held the
equivalent of the job title &quot;construction&quot; official or &quot;subcode&quot;
official, but who no longer holds his position as a result of a determination
that his old job title was not equivalent to that of &quot;construction&quot;
official or &quot;subcode&quot; official, shall be offered reappointment as a
construction official or subcode official, as the case may be, and shall be
granted permanent classified status in such position.  Tenure shall continue

tenure as otherwise provided by law on the effective date of <b><span

Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, who, at the time of
adoption of the State Uniform Construction Code, January 1, 1977, or prior to
January 1, 1981, had permanent classified status or was employed as a construction
official or subcode official or in another position in the unclassified
service, shall be included in the classified service without civil service
examination in his respective title of construction official or subcode
official.  Any individual employed by a municipality, who, in his employment
with the municipality between January 1, 1977 and prior to January 1, 1981, was
charged with the chief administrative responsibility to enforce all existing
municipal construction codes, shall be deemed as appointed to the position of

operating under Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes without
having passed an examination administered by the Civil Service Commission
certifying the merit and fitness of the person to hold such position; provided
that, whenever a noncivil service municipality adopts the provisions of that
Title, construction code officials and subcode officials of such municipality
appointed prior to the filing of the petition for the adoption of civil
service, shall attain permanent status in the classified service without
examination. Any construction or subcode official appointed after January 1,
1981 on a provisional basis in a municipality which has adopted the provisions
of Title 11A, Civil Service, of the New Jersey Statutes, may not be removed
from office except for just cause after a fair and impartial hearing has been
held at the local level, with no further appeal to the Civil Service Commission;

Service Commission.</p>
