<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     1.    Section 48 of P.L.2021,
c.16 (C.24:6I-52) is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     48.  a.  (1)  <b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>[</span></b>No<b><span
style='font-family:"Albertus Extra Bold",sans-serif'>]</span></b> <u>Except as
provided in section 2 of P.L.    , c.   
(C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;(pending before the Legislature as this
bill), no</u> employer shall refuse to hire or employ any person or shall
discharge from employment or take any adverse action against any employee with
respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or other privileges of employment
because that person does or does not smoke, vape, aerosolize or otherwise use
cannabis items, and an employee shall not be subject to any adverse action by
an employer solely due to the presence of cannabinoid metabolites in the
employee's bodily fluid from engaging in conduct permitted under P.L.2021, c.16
(C.24:6I-31 et al.).  However, an employer may require an employee to undergo a
drug test upon reasonable suspicion of an employee's usage of a cannabis item
while engaged in the performance of the employee's work responsibilities, or
upon finding any observable signs of intoxication related to usage of a
cannabis item, or following a work-related accident subject to investigation by
the employer.  A drug test may also be done randomly by the employer, or as
part of a pre-employment screening, or regular screening of current employees
to determine use during an employee's prescribed work hours.  The drug test
shall include scientifically reliable objective testing methods and procedures,
such as testing of blood, urine, or saliva, and a physical evaluation in order
to determine an employee's state of impairment.  The physical evaluation shall
be conducted by an individual with the necessary certification to opine on the
employee's state of impairment, or lack thereof, related to the usage of a
cannabis item in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The
employer may use the results of the drug test when determining the appropriate
employment action concerning the employee, including, but not limited to
dismissal, suspension, demotion, or other disciplinary action. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (2)   (a) In order to better
ensure the protections for prospective employees and employees against refusals
to hire or employ, or against being discharged or having any other adverse
action taken by an employer, while simultaneously supporting the authority of
employers to require employees undergo drug tests under the circumstances set
forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, as well as employer efforts to
maintain a drug- and alcohol-free workplace or</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>other drug- or alcohol workplace
policy as described in paragraph (1) of subsection b. of this section, the
commission, in consultation with the Police Training Commission established
pursuant to section 5 of P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-70), shall prescribe
standards in regulation for a Workplace Impairment Recognition Expert
certification, to be issued to full- or part-time employees, or others
contracted to perform services on behalf of an employer, based on education and
training in detecting and identifying an employee's usage of, or impairment
from, a cannabis item or other intoxicating substance, and for assisting in the
investigation of workplace accidents.  The commission's regulations shall also
prescribe minimum curriculum courses of study for the certifications, as well
as standards for the commission's approval and continuation of approval of
non-profit and for-profit programs, organizations, or schools and their
instructors to offer courses of study, and may include the use of a Police
Training Commission approved school as that term is defined in section 2 of
P.L.1961, c.56 (C.52:17B-67) if consented to by the Police Training Commission.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   Any person who
demonstrates to the commission's satisfaction that the person has successfully
completed a Drug Recognition Expert program provided by a Police Training
Commission approved school, or another program or course conducted by any
federal, State, or other public or private agency, the requirements of which
are substantially equivalent to the requirements established by the commission
pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph for a Workplace Impairment
Recognition Expert certification, may, at the discretion of the commission, be
issued this certification, subject to subsequent continuation of certification
approval by the commission.  </p>

c.16 (C.24:6I-31 et al.): </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (1)  (a)  Requires an employer
to amend or repeal, or affect, restrict or preempt the rights and obligations
of employers to maintain a drug- and alcohol-free workplace or require an
employer to permit or accommodate the use, consumption, being under the
influence, possession, transfer, display, transportation, sale, or growth of
cannabis or cannabis items in the workplace, or to affect the ability of
employers to have policies prohibiting use of cannabis items or intoxication by
employees during work hours; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (b)   If any of the provisions
set forth in this paragraph or subsection a. of this section result in a
provable adverse impact on an employer subject to the requirements of a federal
contract, then the employer may revise their employee prohibitions consistent
with federal law, rules, and regulations; </p>

under 21 years of age, but at least 18 years of age, and an employee of a
cannabis establishment, distributor, or delivery service acting in the person's
employment capacity;  </p>

subsection c. of section 46 of P.L.2021, c.16 (C.2C:35-10a), prohibit a person

regulating the consumption, use, display, transfer, distribution, sale, or
transportation of cannabis items on or in that property, or portion thereof,

are prohibited from refusing to hire a prospective employee or taking adverse
action against a current employee, including discharge from employment, because
the person does or does not use cannabis items. Employers are permitted to drug
test employees based on a reasonable suspicion of an employees use of a
cannabis item while engaged in the performance of the employees work
