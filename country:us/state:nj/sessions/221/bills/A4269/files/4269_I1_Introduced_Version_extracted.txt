If the plaintiff in any complaint seeking foreclosure of a residential mortgage alleges that the property subject to the residential mortgage has been abandoned or voluntarily surrendered, the plaintiff shall plead the specific facts upon which this allegation is based. g.    If more than 180 days have elapsed since the date the notice required pursuant to this section is sent, and any foreclosure or other legal action to take possession of the residential property which is the subject of the mortgage has not yet been commenced, the lender shall send a new written notice at least 30 days, but not more than 180 days, in advance of that action. h.    If the property which is the subject of the notice of intention to foreclose has more than one dwelling unit but less than five, one of which is occupied by the debtor or a member of the debtor's immediate family as the debtor's or member's residence at the time the loan is originated, and is not properly maintained and meets the necessary conditions for receivership eligibility, established pursuant to section 4 of the "Multifamily Housing Preservation and Receivership Act," P.L.2003, c.295 (C.2A:42-117), the residential mortgage lender shall file an order to show cause to appoint a receiver. i.  No later than one business day following the provision of the notice of intention to foreclose, the lender shall notify the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the agency pursuant to P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), for the purpose of facilitating the housing counseling outreach required pursuant to section 4 of P.L.    , c.    (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). (cf: P.L.2019, c.134, s.4) 2.  Section 1 of P.L.2021, c.373 (C.2A:50-81) is amended to read as follows: 1.  The Legislature finds and declares that: a.     The Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program administered by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency provides trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselors for homeowner-borrowers [participating] as a prerequisite to participation in the Foreclosure Mediation Program established by the New Jersey Judiciary, and to other homeowner-borrowers facing foreclosure, regardless of whether a homeowner-borrower intends to participate in foreclosure mediation. b.    As provided by section 7 of the "New Jersey Foreclosure Mediation Act," P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-80), trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselors are paid using a portion of funds paid by a foreclosure plaintiff in an action for foreclosure. c.     During the public health emergency declared by the Governor in Executive Order No. 103 of 2020 due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency expanded its Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program to provide other supports to New Jersey residents including renter and pre-foreclosure counseling. d.    Since the expansion began, nearly 5,000 households have been served. e.     Sufficient funding exists for trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselors to continue to provide pre-foreclosure counseling services although the public health emergency declared by the Governor in Executive Order No. 103 of 2020 has concluded. f.     In the event of a declaration of a state of emergency, persons who have been trained to provide foreclosure counseling services under the Foreclosure Mediation Assistance Program are well positioned to help disaster victims prepare and submit applications for State and federal disaster assistance. (cf: P.L.2023, c.123, s.1) 3.  Section 2 of P.L.2021, c.373 (C.2A:50-82) is amended to read as follows: 2.  a.  There is established in the General Fund a separate, non-lapsing, dedicated account administered by the Department of Community Affairs to be known as the "New Jersey Foreclosure Counseling Fund." b.    The funds within the New Jersey Foreclosure Counseling Fund shall be paid to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency no later than the 15th day of each quarter to reimburse trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselors for costs expended thereby in: (1)  providing pre-foreclosure counseling services in accordance with guidance established by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and for the agency's services required under P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-74 et [seq.)] al.), including, but not limited to, services provided as a prerequisite to participation in foreclosure mediation; [and] (2)  providing, to homeowners and renters who have been impacted by real property damage to, or destruction on, their primary residence, as a result of an event that prompted the Governor or the President of the United States to declare a state of emergency or issue an emergency disaster declaration, assistance in the preparation and submission of applications for housing related expenses, including, but not limited to: (a) rental payments; (b) mortgage payments; (c) insurance payments; (d) property tax payments; and (e) repair, rehabilitation, or relocation assistance payments that have been made available, by the State or federal government, in response to the declared emergency or disaster; and (3)  offering counseling services to homeowner-borrowers facing foreclosure, regardless of whether a homeowner-borrower intends to participate in foreclosure mediation. c.     The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency may assess up to five percent of New Jersey Foreclosure Counseling Fund's annual allocation amounts for administrative costs. d.    For purposes of this section, "trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselors" shall have the same definition as in section 2 of the "New Jersey Foreclosure Mediation Act," P.L.2019, c.64 (C.2A:50-75). (cf: P.L.2023, c.123, s.2) 4.  (New section)  When the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency is notified, pursuant to subsection i. of section 4 of P.L.1995, c.244 (C.2A:50-56), that a residential mortgage lender has provided a homeowner-borrower with a notice of intention to foreclose, the agency shall ensure that a trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselor promptly and diligently contacts the homeowner-borrower, to offer counseling services to the homeowner-borrower. 5.  On or before the first day of the fourth month next following enactment, the Executive Director of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency shall, pursuant to the "Administrative Procedure Act," P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of P.L.    , c. (C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). 6.  This act shall take effect immediately, but its provisions shall remain inoperative until the first day of the fourth month next following enactment. STATEMENT This bill is intended to enhance access to financial counseling services for homeowners facing foreclosure. Under existing law, a homeowner facing foreclosure is required to engage in financial counseling as a prerequisite for participating in foreclosure mediation services offered by the Judiciary.  These existing counseling services are funded by the "New Jersey Foreclosure Counseling Fund" (counseling fund), administered by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA). This bill would expressly provide that the financial counseling services would be offered through the counseling fund to homeowners facing foreclosure, regardless of whether a homeowner intends to participate in foreclosure mediation.  The bill would further provide that, whenever a residential mortgage lender provides a homeowner with a notice of intention to foreclose, no later than one business day following that action, the lender would also be required to notify HMFA, for the purpose of facilitating housing counseling outreach.  Upon receiving this notice, the bill requires HMFA to ensure that a trained foreclosure prevention and default mitigation counselor promptly and diligently contacts the homeowner to offer counseling services. The bill takes effect on the first day of the fourth month following enactment, and directs HMFA to adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the provisions of the bill on or before the effective date.
