(3)   (Deleted by amendment, P.L.1997, c.139.) (4)   The State Treasurer shall furnish annual report forms, shall keep in his office all such reports and shall prepare an alphabetical index thereof, which reports and index shall be open to public inspection at proper hours. (5)   In the event a domestic corporation fails to file an annual report for two consecutive years with the State Treasurer, then, after written notice by certified mail to the corporation at its last known main business or headquarters office or at the address of its registered agent, the State Treasurer may issue a proclamation declaring that the certificate of incorporation of the corporation has been revoked and that all powers conferred by law upon it shall thereafter be inoperative and void.  The proclamation of the State Treasurer shall be filed in the office of the State Treasurer.  No corporation's certificate of incorporation shall be revoked pursuant to this subsection if, within 30 days after the giving of notice, it files the reports required by law and pays to the State Treasurer all of the fees due for the filing of the reports. (6)   In the event a foreign corporation fails to file an annual report for two consecutive years with the State Treasurer, then, after written notice by certified mail to the corporation at its last known main business or headquarters office or at the address of its registered agent, the State Treasurer may issue a proclamation declaring that the certificate of authority to do business of the corporation and the powers conferred by law upon it shall be revoked.  The proclamation of the State Treasurer shall be filed in the office of the State Treasurer.  No corporation's certificate of authority shall be revoked pursuant to this paragraph if, within 30 days after the giving of notice, it files the reports required by law and pays to the State Treasurer all of the fees due for the filing of the reports.
