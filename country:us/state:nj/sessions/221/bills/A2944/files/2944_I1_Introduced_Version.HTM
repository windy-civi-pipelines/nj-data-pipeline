student who is selected through the lottery decide not enroll the student, then
the charter school will fill that enrollment space with a student from the
waiting list.  Under current law, a random selection process is only used if
there are more applicants than there are openings in the charter school.  The
routine use of lotteries will help to ensure that a charter schools enrollment
reflects the demographics of its district of residence;</p>

school to file with the Commissioner of Education and its district of residence
a report on the student enrollment demographics of the charter school by

Department of Education, the charter school, and the charter school district of
residence;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (3)   requires a charter
school to maintain a waiting list for admission to the school and to annually
submit the number and demographics of students on the waiting list to the
commissioner.  The department and the charter school will post the number and
student demographics on their websites and update the number as appropriate;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (4)   requires the adjustment
of the per pupil tax levy amount that a district of residence must send to a
charter school if the districts budget is defeated by the voters or
disapproved by the board of school estimate and the districts tax levy is
reduced.  The per pupil adjustment will reflect the reduced tax levy; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (5)   requires that a charter
schools annual report required under current law include information on the
students who have left the charter school during the preceding school year
through withdrawal, expulsion, other disciplinary action, or any other
circumstance;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (6)   requires that the

any provision of its charter concerning fiscal responsibility; or</p>

to post a charter schools approved budget on the departments website;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (10) permits a board of
education and a charter school to enter into a written agreement to conduct
collaborative education programs or implement shared services if the
arrangement will lead to improvement for all students in areas such as teacher
quality and student achievement;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     (11) requires that a charter
school, upon the revocation of its charter, provide the commissioner and the
parents or guardians of its students with information on how to transfer the
student to the students school district of residence, and to forward all
student records to that district;</p>
