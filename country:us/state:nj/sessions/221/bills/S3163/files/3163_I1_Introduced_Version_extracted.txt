Such prohibited conduct shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   Buying from, selling to, leasing from or to, licensing, contracting with, trading with, providing goods, services, or information to, or otherwise doing business with any person because that person does, or agrees or attempts to do, any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; or (2)   Boycotting, commercially blacklisting or refusing to buy from, sell to, lease from or to, license, contract with, provide goods, services or information to, or otherwise do business with any person because that person has not done or refuses to do any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; provided that this subsection shall not prohibit refusals or other actions either pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, labor disputes, or unfair labor practices, or made or taken in connection with a protest of unlawful discrimination or unlawful employment practices. o.    For any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization or other service, organization or facility related to the business of selling or renting dwellings to deny any person access to or membership or participation in such organization, or to discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or participation, on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, familial status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, disability, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality. p.    Nothing in the provisions of this section shall affect the ability of an employer to require employees to adhere to reasonable workplace appearance, grooming and dress standards not precluded by other provisions of State or federal law, except that an employer shall allow an employee to appear, groom and dress consistent with the employee's gender identity or expression. q.  (1)  For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)  (a)  For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i)  The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 30.  Section 12 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-13) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  (1)  Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make, sign, and file with the division a verified complaint in writing which shall state the name and address of the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or agent alleged to have committed the unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination complained of and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and shall contain such other information as may be required by the division.  Upon receipt of the complaint, the division shall notify the complainant on a form promulgated by the director of the division and approved by the [Attorney General] commissioner of the complainant's rights under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), including the right to file a complaint in the Superior Court to be heard before a jury; of the jurisdictional limitations of the division; and any other provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), without interpretation, that may apply to the complaint. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Attorney General, the commissioner, the director, or the Commissioner of Education may, in like manner, make, sign, and file [such] a complaint.  Any employer whose employees, or some of them, refuse, or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), may file with the division a verified complaint asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action. (2)   Any complainant, including any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination, the Attorney General, the commissioner, the director, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Commissioner of Education, may initiate suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) without first filing a complaint with the division or any municipal office. In [such] these proceedings: (a)   Upon the application of any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) specified in the suit. (b)   All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs, and if the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, those remedies shall be available on behalf of named or unnamed victims. If the suit seeks relief for one or more unnamed members of a protected class, the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director shall have the discretion to settle the suit on such terms as the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director deems appropriate. The injunctive relief set forth in section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) shall also be available to prevailing plaintiffs.  These remedies are in addition to any other provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute. (c)   In addition to the remedies set forth in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the [Attorney General] commissioner or director may seek and obtain from the Superior Court penalties pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1983, c.412 (C.10:5-14.1a).  In the alternative, in lieu of these penalties, the [Attorney General] commissioner or director may seek and obtain punitive damages payable to the State upon a finding that the provisions of P.L.1995, c.142 (C.2A:15-5.9 et al.) are satisfied. Prosecution of such suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall bar the filing of a complaint with the division or any municipal office during the pendency of any such suit. (d)   If a jury or court determines that an employer has committed an unlawful employment practice prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), the judge shall award three times any monetary damages to the person or persons aggrieved by the violation. (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of P.L.1979, c.404 (C.10:5-27.1), if the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and litigation and investigation costs. b.    At any time after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the division, a complainant may file a request with the division to present the action personally or through counsel to the Office of Administrative Law.  Upon such request, the director of the division shall file the action with the Office of Administrative Law, provided that no action may be filed with the Office of Administrative Law where the director of the division has found that no probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the complaint or has otherwise dismissed the complaint. c.     A party to an action based upon a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall mail a copy of the initial pleadings or claims, amended pleadings or claims, counterclaims, briefs, and legal memoranda to the division at the same time as filing such documents with the Office of Administrative Law or the court.  Upon application to the Office of Administrative Law or to the court wherein the matter is pending, the division shall be permitted to intervene. (cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.5) 31.  Section 13 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-14) is amended to read as follows: 13. After the filing of any complaint, the [Attorney General] commissioner shall cause prompt investigation to be made in connection therewith and advise the complainant of the results thereof.  During the period beginning with the filing of such complaint and ending with the closure of the case or 45 days from the date of a finding of probable cause, the [Attorney General] commissioner shall, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to [such] the complaint.  Neither the [Attorney General] commissioner nor any officer or employee of the division shall disclose any conversation between the [Attorney General] commissioner or a representative and the respondent or a representative at [such] the conference, except that the [Attorney General] commissioner and any officer or employee may disclose the terms of a settlement offer to the complainant or other aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed.

If the conduct violative of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) constitutes any form of unlawful economic discrimination prohibited in subsection 1., m., or n. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or any form of unlawful employment practice prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), the affirmative action taken by the director may include the award of three-fold damages to the person or persons aggrieved by the violation.  The director shall have the power to use reasonably certain bases, including but not limited to list, catalogue or market prices or values, or contract or advertised terms and conditions, in order to determine particulars or performance in giving appropriate remedy.  In addition to any other remedies provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), a prevailing complainant may recover damages to compensate for emotional distress caused by the activities found to be in violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) to the same extent as is available in common law tort actions.  In any case in which the director, [Attorney General] commissioner, or appropriate organization is a complainant, on behalf of named or unnamed individuals or a class of individuals, any of the remedies or relief allowed by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) may be awarded or applied to the named or unnamed individual victims of discrimination. If, upon all evidence, the director shall find that the respondent has not engaged in any such unlawful practice or unlawful discrimination, the director shall state [his] findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing the [said] complaint as to [such] the respondent. This section shall not apply to a violation regarding an inquiry as to an applicant's salary history pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2019, c.199 (C.10:4-12.12).

(cf: P.L.1963, c.40, s.17) 36.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month following enactment, except that such anticipatory actions may be taken in advance of the effective date as deemed necessary and appropriate to implement this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DDEI) as a new principal department within the Executive Branch.  The bill specifies the commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is appointed by the Governor with advice and consent of the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor during the Governors term of office.  The commissioner serves as the administrator and chief executive officer of the DDEI. The functions, powers, and duties of the commissioner are set forth in this bill and will include: consulting and assisting on efforts by the Director of the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury to attempt to use underrepresented financial businesses to provide brokerage and investment management services; consulting and assisting on diversity, equity, and inclusion in investments by the State, and its political subdivisions, in the allocation of loans and grants for business formation, and in the provision of low interest loans and down payment support for homeowners; and consulting and assisting on diversity, equity, and inclusion in procurement by the State and its political subdivisions. The bill transfers certain State offices, units, and responsibilities to the DDEI.  The functions, powers, and duties of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Small Business Registration and Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Certification Services Unit in the Department of the Treasury would be transferred to the DDEI.  Additionally, the DDEI would be responsible for the operation and continued development of the central registry, known as the Selective Assistance Vendor Information (SAVI II) database, which lists businesses certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State set-aside program. The bill requires Statewide and State agency-specific strategic plans for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in State government workforce.  Under the bill, the Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, in consultation with the State Treasurer, Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, and Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Service Commission must establish a coordinated Statewide initiative to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the State government workforce.  Under the bill, the head of each State agency must, no later than 45 days following the issuance of the Statewide diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan, and annually thereafter, develop and submit to Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion the diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan. The bill also requires the Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to issue guidance on and State agencies to address: (1)  paid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships; (2)  strengthening partnerships and recruitment with diverse communities and institutions; (3)  pay equity; (4)  data collection; (5)  ensuring accessibility for State employees with disabilities; (6)  evaluating the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing State employment opportunities; and (7)  the availability and use of diversity training programs. This bill establishes a requirement, to be overseen and enforced by the new department, that any entity which receives a development subsidy or financial assistance from the State submit and implement a strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan to the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The plan is intended to assist corporations and not-for-profit entities in better understanding the States demographics, while affording minority-owned and women-owned businesses more opportunities to participate in the procurement of goods and services to the public and private sector.  The bill specifies what information an entity is required to include in the strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan. Each recipient of a development subsidy or financial assistance is required, for the duration of the subsidy or five years, whichever is longer, to submit annual reports on the progress of the recipient towards achieving its diversity, equity, and inclusion goals for the reporting period. This bill also transfers the Division on Civil Rights to the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The division currently is in the Department of Law and Public Safety and is under the direction of the Attorney General, in conjunction with a commission consisting of seven public members appointed by the Governor. Under the bill, the commissioner of the department assumes the responsibilities of the Attorney General.  The public member commission continues in its current capacity.

Such prohibited conduct shall include, but not be limited to: (1)   Buying from, selling to, leasing from or to, licensing, contracting with, trading with, providing goods, services, or information to, or otherwise doing business with any person because that person does, or agrees or attempts to do, any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; or (2)   Boycotting, commercially blacklisting or refusing to buy from, sell to, lease from or to, license, contract with, provide goods, services or information to, or otherwise do business with any person because that person has not done or refuses to do any such act or any act prohibited by this subsection; provided that this subsection shall not prohibit refusals or other actions either pertaining to employee-employer collective bargaining, labor disputes, or unfair labor practices, or made or taken in connection with a protest of unlawful discrimination or unlawful employment practices. o.    For any multiple listing service, real estate brokers' organization or other service, organization or facility related to the business of selling or renting dwellings to deny any person access to or membership or participation in such organization, or to discriminate against such person in the terms or conditions of such access, membership, or participation, on account of race, creed, color, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, familial status, pregnancy or breastfeeding, sex, gender identity or expression, affectional or sexual orientation, disability, liability for service in the Armed Forces of the United States or nationality. p.    Nothing in the provisions of this section shall affect the ability of an employer to require employees to adhere to reasonable workplace appearance, grooming and dress standards not precluded by other provisions of State or federal law, except that an employer shall allow an employee to appear, groom and dress consistent with the employee's gender identity or expression. q.  (1)  For any employer to impose upon a person as a condition of obtaining or retaining employment, including opportunities for promotion, advancement or transfers, any terms or conditions that would require a person to violate or forego a sincerely held religious practice or religious observance, including but not limited to the observance of any particular day or days or any portion thereof as a Sabbath or other holy day in accordance with the requirements of the religion or religious belief, unless, after engaging in a bona fide effort, the employer demonstrates that it is unable to reasonably accommodate the employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, an employee shall not be entitled to premium wages or premium benefits for work performed during hours to which those premium wages or premium benefits would ordinarily be applicable, if the employee is working during those hours only as an accommodation to his religious requirements. Nothing in this subsection q. shall be construed as reducing: (a)   The number of the hours worked by the employee which are counted towards the accruing of seniority, pension or other benefits; or (b)   Any premium wages or benefits provided to an employee pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. (2)   For an employer to refuse to permit an employee to utilize leave, as provided for in this subsection q., which is solely used to accommodate the employee's sincerely held religious observance or practice.  Except where it would cause an employer to incur an undue hardship, no person shall be required to remain at his place of employment during any day or days or portion thereof that, as a requirement of his religion, he observes as his Sabbath or other holy day, including a reasonable time prior and subsequent thereto for travel between his place of employment and his home; provided that any such absence from work shall, wherever practicable in the reasonable judgment of the employer, be made up by an equivalent amount of time and work at some other mutually convenient time, or shall be charged against any leave with pay ordinarily granted, other than sick leave, and any such absence not so made up or charged, may be treated by the employer of that person as leave taken without pay. (3)  (a)  For purposes of this subsection q., "undue hardship" means an accommodation requiring unreasonable expense or difficulty, unreasonable interference with the safe or efficient operation of the workplace or a violation of a bona fide seniority system or a violation of any provision of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. (b)   In determining whether the accommodation constitutes an undue hardship, the factors considered shall include: (i)    The identifiable cost of the accommodation, including the costs of loss of productivity and of retaining or hiring employees or transferring employees from one facility to another, in relation to the size and operating cost of the employer. (ii)   The number of individuals who will need the particular accommodation for a sincerely held religious observance or practice. (iii) For an employer with multiple facilities, the degree to which the geographic separateness or administrative or fiscal relationship of the facilities will make the accommodation more difficult or expensive. (c)   An accommodation shall be considered to constitute an undue hardship if it will result in the inability of an employee to perform the essential functions of the position in which he or she is employed. (d)   (i)  The provisions of this subsection q. shall be applicable only to reasonable accommodations of religious observances and shall not supersede any definition of undue hardship or standards for reasonable accommodation of the disabilities of employees. (ii)   This subsection q. shall not apply where the uniform application of terms and conditions of attendance to employees is essential to prevent undue hardship to the employer.  The burden of proof regarding the applicability of this subparagraph (d) shall be upon the employer. r.     For any employer to take reprisals against any employee for requesting from, discussing with, or disclosing to, any other employee or former employee of the employer, a lawyer from whom the employee seeks legal advice, or any government agency information regarding the job title, occupational category, and rate of compensation, including benefits, of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, or the gender, race, ethnicity, military status, or national origin of the employee or any other employee or former employee of the employer, regardless of whether the request was responded to, or to require, as a condition of employment, any employee or prospective employee to sign a waiver, or to otherwise require an employee or prospective employee to agree, not to make those requests or disclosures.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require an employee to disclose such information about the employee herself to any other employee or former employee of the employer or to any authorized representative of the other employee or former employee. s.     For an employer to treat, for employment-related purposes, a woman employee that the employer knows, or should know, is affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding in a manner less favorable than the treatment of other persons not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  In addition, an employer of an employee who is a woman affected by pregnancy shall make available to the employee reasonable accommodation in the workplace, such as bathroom breaks, breaks for increased water intake, periodic rest, assistance with manual labor, job restructuring or modified work schedules, and temporary transfers to less strenuous or hazardous work, for needs related to the pregnancy when the employee, based on the advice of her physician, requests the accommodation, and, in the case of a employee breast feeding her infant child, the accommodation shall include reasonable break time each day to the employee and a suitable room or other location with privacy, other than a toilet stall, in close proximity to the work area for the employee to express breast milk for the child, unless the employer can demonstrate that providing the accommodation would be an undue hardship on the business operations of the employer.  The employer shall not in any way penalize the employee in terms, conditions or privileges of employment for requesting or using the accommodation. Workplace accommodation provided pursuant to this subsection and paid or unpaid leave provided to an employee affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding shall not be provided in a manner less favorable than accommodations or leave provided to other employees not affected by pregnancy or breastfeeding but similar in their ability or inability to work.  This subsection shall not be construed as otherwise increasing or decreasing any employee's rights under law to paid or unpaid leave in connection with pregnancy or breastfeeding. For the purposes of this section "pregnancy or breastfeeding" means pregnancy, childbirth, and breast feeding or expressing milk for breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, including recovery from childbirth. For the purposes of this subsection, in determining whether an accommodation would impose undue hardship on the operation of an employer's business, the factors to be considered include: the overall size of the employer's business with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; the type of the employer's operations, including the composition and structure of the employer's workforce; the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, taking into consideration the availability of tax credits, tax deductions, and outside funding; and the extent to which the accommodation would involve waiver of an essential requirement of a job as opposed to a tangential or non-business necessity requirement. t.     For an employer to pay any of its employees who is a member of a protected class at a rate of compensation, including benefits, which is less than the rate paid by the employer to employees who are not members of the protected class for substantially similar work, when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility.  An employer who is paying a rate of compensation in violation of this subsection shall not reduce the rate of compensation of any employee in order to comply with this subsection.  An employer may pay a different rate of compensation only if the employer demonstrates that the differential is made pursuant to a seniority system, a merit system, or the employer demonstrates: (1)   That the differential is based on one or more legitimate, bona fide factors other than the characteristics of members of the protected class, such as training, education or experience, or the quantity or quality of production; (2)   That the factor or factors are not based on, and do not perpetuate, a differential in compensation based on sex or any other characteristic of members of a protected class; (3)   That each of the factors is applied reasonably; (4)   That one or more of the factors account for the entire wage differential; and (5)   That the factors are job-related with respect to the position in question and based on a legitimate business necessity.  A factor based on business necessity shall not apply if it is demonstrated that there are alternative business practices that would serve the same business purpose without producing the wage differential. Comparisons of wage rates shall be based on wage rates in all of an employer's operations or facilities. For the purposes of this subsection, "member of a protected class" means an employee who has one or more characteristics, including race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, marital status, civil union status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, genetic information, pregnancy, sex, gender identity or expression, disability or atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait of any individual, or liability for service in the armed forces, for which subsection a. of this section prohibits an employer from refusing to hire or employ or barring or discharging or requiring to retire from employment or discriminating against the individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment. (cf: P.L.2021, c.248, s.2) 30.  Section 12 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-13) is amended to read as follows: 12.  a.  (1)  Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination may, personally or by an attorney-at-law, make, sign, and file with the division a verified complaint in writing which shall state the name and address of the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or agent alleged to have committed the unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination complained of and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and shall contain such other information as may be required by the division.  Upon receipt of the complaint, the division shall notify the complainant on a form promulgated by the director of the division and approved by the [Attorney General] commissioner of the complainant's rights under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), including the right to file a complaint in the Superior Court to be heard before a jury; of the jurisdictional limitations of the division; and any other provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), without interpretation, that may apply to the complaint. The Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, the Attorney General, the commissioner, the director, or the Commissioner of Education may, in like manner, make, sign, and file [such] a complaint.  Any employer whose employees, or some of them, refuse, or threaten to refuse to cooperate with the provisions of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), may file with the division a verified complaint asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial action. (2)   Any complainant, including any person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful employment practice or an unlawful discrimination, the Attorney General, the commissioner, the director, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, or the Commissioner of Education, may initiate suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) without first filing a complaint with the division or any municipal office. In [such] these proceedings: (a)   Upon the application of any party, a jury trial shall be directed to try the validity of any claim under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) specified in the suit. (b)   All remedies available in common law tort actions shall be available to prevailing plaintiffs, and if the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, those remedies shall be available on behalf of named or unnamed victims. If the suit seeks relief for one or more unnamed members of a protected class, the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director shall have the discretion to settle the suit on such terms as the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director deems appropriate. The injunctive relief set forth in section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) shall also be available to prevailing plaintiffs.  These remedies are in addition to any other provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) or any other statute. (c)   In addition to the remedies set forth in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, the [Attorney General] commissioner or director may seek and obtain from the Superior Court penalties pursuant to section 2 of P.L.1983, c.412 (C.10:5-14.1a).  In the alternative, in lieu of these penalties, the [Attorney General] commissioner or director may seek and obtain punitive damages payable to the State upon a finding that the provisions of P.L.1995, c.142 (C.2A:15-5.9 et al.) are satisfied. Prosecution of such suit in Superior Court under P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall bar the filing of a complaint with the division or any municipal office during the pendency of any such suit. (d)   If a jury or court determines that an employer has committed an unlawful employment practice prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), the judge shall award three times any monetary damages to the person or persons aggrieved by the violation. (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of P.L.1979, c.404 (C.10:5-27.1), if the [Attorney General] commissioner or the director is a prevailing plaintiff, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and litigation and investigation costs. b.    At any time after 180 days from the filing of a complaint with the division, a complainant may file a request with the division to present the action personally or through counsel to the Office of Administrative Law.  Upon such request, the director of the division shall file the action with the Office of Administrative Law, provided that no action may be filed with the Office of Administrative Law where the director of the division has found that no probable cause exists to credit the allegations of the complaint or has otherwise dismissed the complaint. c.     A party to an action based upon a violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall mail a copy of the initial pleadings or claims, amended pleadings or claims, counterclaims, briefs, and legal memoranda to the division at the same time as filing such documents with the Office of Administrative Law or the court.  Upon application to the Office of Administrative Law or to the court wherein the matter is pending, the division shall be permitted to intervene. (cf: P.L.2019, c.436, s.5) 31.  Section 13 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-14) is amended to read as follows: 13. After the filing of any complaint, the [Attorney General] commissioner shall cause prompt investigation to be made in connection therewith and advise the complainant of the results thereof.  During the period beginning with the filing of such complaint and ending with the closure of the case or 45 days from the date of a finding of probable cause, the [Attorney General] commissioner shall, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to [such] the complaint.  Neither the [Attorney General] commissioner nor any officer or employee of the division shall disclose any conversation between the [Attorney General] commissioner or a representative and the respondent or a representative at [such] the conference, except that the [Attorney General] commissioner and any officer or employee may disclose the terms of a settlement offer to the complainant or other aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed. (cf: P.L.2003, c.180, s.14) 32.  Section 14 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-15) is amended to read as follows: 14.  In case of failure [so] to eliminate [such] an unlawful employment practice or discrimination, or in advance thereof if in [his] the commissioners judgment circumstances so warrant, the [Attorney General] commissioner shall cause to be issued and served in the name of the division, a written notice, together with a copy of [such] the complaint, as the same may have been amended, requiring the person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, lessee, proprietor, manager, superintendent, or agent named in [such] the complaint, hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer the charges of  [such] the complaint at a hearing before the director at a time and place to be specified in [such] the notice.  The place of any such hearing shall be the office of the [Attorney General] commissioner or [such] other place as may be designated by [him] the commissioner. (cf: P.L.1963, c.40, s.9) 33.  Section 16 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-17) is amended to read as follows: 16.  If, upon all evidence at the hearing, the director shall find that the respondent has engaged in any unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination as defined in P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), the director shall state [his] findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on [such] the respondent an order requiring [such] the respondent to cease and desist from [such] the unlawful employment practice or unlawful discrimination and to take [such] affirmative action[,] including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, or restoration to membership, in any respondent labor organization, or extending full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges to all persons, as, in the judgment of the director, will effectuate the purpose of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance. If the conduct violative of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) constitutes any form of unlawful economic discrimination prohibited in subsection 1., m., or n. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), or any form of unlawful employment practice prohibited by subsection r. or t. of section 11 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-12), the affirmative action taken by the director may include the award of three-fold damages to the person or persons aggrieved by the violation.  The director shall have the power to use reasonably certain bases, including but not limited to list, catalogue or market prices or values, or contract or advertised terms and conditions, in order to determine particulars or performance in giving appropriate remedy.  In addition to any other remedies provided by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), a prevailing complainant may recover damages to compensate for emotional distress caused by the activities found to be in violation of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) to the same extent as is available in common law tort actions.  In any case in which the director, [Attorney General] commissioner, or appropriate organization is a complainant, on behalf of named or unnamed individuals or a class of individuals, any of the remedies or relief allowed by P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) may be awarded or applied to the named or unnamed individual victims of discrimination. If, upon all evidence, the director shall find that the respondent has not engaged in any such unlawful practice or unlawful discrimination, the director shall state [his] findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue and cause to be served on the complainant an order dismissing the [said] complaint as to [such] the respondent. This section shall not apply to a violation regarding an inquiry as to an applicant's salary history pursuant to section 2 of P.L.2019, c.199 (C.10:4-12.12). (cf: P.L.2019, c.199, s.4) 34.  Section 17 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-18) is amended to read as follows: 17.  The [Attorney General] commissioner shall establish rules of practice to govern, expedite, and effectuate the foregoing procedure and [his] the commissioners own actions thereunder.  Any complaint filed in the division or in any municipal office pursuant to [this act must] P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.) shall be [so] filed within 180 days after the alleged act of discrimination. (cf: P.L.1979, c.404, s.4) 35.  Section 25 of P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-26) is amended to read as follows: 25.  Any person who shall willfully resist, prevent, impede, or interfere with the [Attorney General] commissioner or any representative of the division in the performance of duty under [this act] P.L.1945, c.169 (C.10:5-1 et seq.), or shall willfully violate an order of the [Attorney General] commissioner, or the director, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more  than $500.00, or by both; but procedure for the review of the order shall not be deemed to be [such] willful conduct. (cf: P.L.1963, c.40, s.17) 36.  This act shall take effect on the first day of the seventh month following enactment, except that such anticipatory actions may be taken in advance of the effective date as deemed necessary and appropriate to implement this act. STATEMENT This bill establishes the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DDEI) as a new principal department within the Executive Branch.  The bill specifies the commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is appointed by the Governor with advice and consent of the Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor during the Governors term of office.  The commissioner serves as the administrator and chief executive officer of the DDEI. The functions, powers, and duties of the commissioner are set forth in this bill and will include: consulting and assisting on efforts by the Director of the Division of Investment in the Department of the Treasury to attempt to use underrepresented financial businesses to provide brokerage and investment management services; consulting and assisting on diversity, equity, and inclusion in investments by the State, and its political subdivisions, in the allocation of loans and grants for business formation, and in the provision of low interest loans and down payment support for homeowners; and consulting and assisting on diversity, equity, and inclusion in procurement by the State and its political subdivisions. The bill transfers certain State offices, units, and responsibilities to the DDEI.  The functions, powers, and duties of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and the Small Business Registration and Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Certification Services Unit in the Department of the Treasury would be transferred to the DDEI.  Additionally, the DDEI would be responsible for the operation and continued development of the central registry, known as the Selective Assistance Vendor Information (SAVI II) database, which lists businesses certified as eligible to perform contracts under any State set-aside program. The bill requires Statewide and State agency-specific strategic plans for diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in State government workforce.  Under the bill, the Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, in consultation with the State Treasurer, Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, and Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of the Civil Service Commission must establish a coordinated Statewide initiative to promote diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the State government workforce.  Under the bill, the head of each State agency must, no later than 45 days following the issuance of the Statewide diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan, and annually thereafter, develop and submit to Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion the diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility strategic plan. The bill also requires the Commissioner of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to issue guidance on and State agencies to address: (1)  paid internships, fellowships, and apprenticeships; (2)  strengthening partnerships and recruitment with diverse communities and institutions; (3)  pay equity; (4)  data collection; (5)  ensuring accessibility for State employees with disabilities; (6)  evaluating the existence of any barriers that formerly incarcerated individuals face in accessing State employment opportunities; and (7)  the availability and use of diversity training programs. This bill establishes a requirement, to be overseen and enforced by the new department, that any entity which receives a development subsidy or financial assistance from the State submit and implement a strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan to the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The plan is intended to assist corporations and not-for-profit entities in better understanding the States demographics, while affording minority-owned and women-owned businesses more opportunities to participate in the procurement of goods and services to the public and private sector.  The bill specifies what information an entity is required to include in the strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan. Each recipient of a development subsidy or financial assistance is required, for the duration of the subsidy or five years, whichever is longer, to submit annual reports on the progress of the recipient towards achieving its diversity, equity, and inclusion goals for the reporting period. This bill also transfers the Division on Civil Rights to the Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.  The division currently is in the Department of Law and Public Safety and is under the direction of the Attorney General, in conjunction with a commission consisting of seven public members appointed by the Governor. Under the bill, the commissioner of the department assumes the responsibilities of the Attorney General.  The public member commission continues in its current capacity.
