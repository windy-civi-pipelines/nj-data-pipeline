"Over-the-counter-drug" means a drug that contains a label which identifies the product as a drug, required by 21 CFR 201.66.  The label includes: (1)   a "Drug Facts" panel or (2)   a statement of the "active ingredient" or "active ingredients" with a list of those ingredients contained in the compound, substance or preparation. "Over-the-counter drug" does not include a grooming and hygiene product.

STATEMENT This bill provides and exemption from the sales and use tax for sales of condoms. According to the federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report, there has been a steady increase in the number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases, including syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. The CDC data suggest that multiple factors are contributing to the overall increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STD), including drug use, poverty, stigma, and unstable housing, all of which can reduce access to STD prevention and care, and decreased condom use among vulnerable populations. It is the sponsors view that exempting the sale of condoms from the sales tax will make them more affordable and encourage people to engage in responsible personal behavior. The bill takes effect immediately, but provides for the exemption to apply to receipts received from all sales made on or after the first day of the fourth month next following enactment.
