indicate on the holders basic drivers license or non-driver identification
card that the person has been diagnosed with a traumatic or acquired brain
injury by a physician, psychologist, or any other health care professional
licensed pursuant to Title 45 of the Revised Statutes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The designation shall be used
by a law enforcement officer or an emergency medical professional to identify
and effectively communicate with a person who has been diagnosed with a
traumatic or acquired brain injury and shall not be used for any other purpose
by any other person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The designation
indicating that a person has been diagnosed with a traumatic or acquired brain
injury pursuant to subsection a. of this section shall be given a restriction
code that shall be displayed on the persons drivers license or non-driver
identification in accordance with procedures prescribed by the chief
administrator.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A holder of a basic driver's

has been diagnosed with a traumatic or acquired brain injury by a physician,
psychologist, or any other health care professional licensed pursuant to Title
45 of the Revised Statutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     The chief administrator shall
permit a person diagnosed with a traumatic or acquired brain injury to
voluntarily report the diagnosis to the commission for inclusion in the
registry.  The registry shall be capable of storing information, which shall
include, but not be limited to: (1) the license plate and registration
information of any motor vehicle that the person intends to regularly operate;
(2) the emergency contact information of a person who can communicate on behalf
of the person with the traumatic or acquired brain injury; and (3) any other
information that may assist a law enforcement officer when communicating with
the person.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     b.    The holder of a basic
driver's license or non-driver identification card may voluntarily submit
information to the registry established pursuant to subsection a. of this
section, through the commissions website, by mail, or when completing an
application for a drivers license, motor vehicle registration, or non-driver
identification card issued by the commission. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     A holder of a basic driver's
license or non-driver identification card who submits information to the
registry established pursuant to this section shall have the opportunity to
revise the information, update the information, or be removed from the registry
at any time. </p>

pursuant to this section shall only be available to: (1) employees of the
commission who are designated by the chief administrator to collect and
maintain the information; and (2) law enforcement officers when accessing the
persons motor vehicle records. The information shall be exclusively used
during a motor vehicle stop or other law enforcement action to assist law
enforcement officers in identifying and effectively communicating with a person
who has been diagnosed with a traumatic or acquired brain injury.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'>     Any information submitted to
the commission pursuant to this section shall not be considered a government
record pursuant to P.L.1963, c.73 (C.47:1A-1 et seq.), <b><sup><span

and employees of the commission who are designated by the chief administrator,
for the purposes of discharging their duties pursuant to P.L.     , c.   
(C.        ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), shall not be liable
to any person for civil damages, or subject to criminal prosecution resulting
from or caused by: (1) any disruption or failure in Internet service caused by
any accident, malfunction, act of sabotage or God, or any other condition or
circumstance that the commission has not, directly or indirectly, caused, and
which prevents the holder of a basic driver's license or non-driver
identification card from accessing, or inputting information into, the registry
established pursuant to this section or which results in, or prevents, the
chief administrator and designated commission employees and law enforcement
officers from accessing, establishing, or maintaining the database; (2) any
misuse of, or the failure or omission to input accurate information, or the inputting
of inaccurate or outdated information into the registry by any holder of a
basic driver's license or non-driver identification card; or (3) the inability
of any law enforcement officer to make contact, in good faith, with any
designated emergency contact person.  This limitation of liability is
inapplicable if the failure resulted from a malicious purpose or a wanton and
willful disregard for the safety of persons or property.</p>
